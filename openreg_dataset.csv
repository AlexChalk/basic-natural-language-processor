The health minister blames a garbage crisis in the country's capital

(CNN) A deadly outbreak of dengue fever has ravaged the island nation of Sri Lanka, killing at least 227 people and infecting tens of thousands.

Experts worry the death toll could yet increase, as the country's health infrastructure struggles to cope with the virus' rapid spread.

""Dengue will get worse as flood waters recede further,"" Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said in comments made to state-owned media outlet Daily News.

The government has deployed 450 troops in a bid to help combat the spread of the disease.

""We are assisting health inspectors to search for dengue breeding areas and have also set up temporary wards at the Negombo Hospital on the outskirts of Colombo to tackle the issue,"" Sri Lankan Army spokesman Brigadier Roshan Senevirathana told CNN."
http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/10/opinions/trump-not-world-leader-opinion-elmets/index.html,WHY TRUMP WILL NEVER BE A GREAT LEADER,"Doug Elmets owns Elmets Communications, a Sacramento-based public affairs firm, worked in the Reagan White House as an assistant press secretary and spoke at the Democratic National Convention as a Republican for Hillary Clinton. Follow him @ElmetsPR . The views expressed in this commentary are his own. For a counter perspective, read Jeffrey Lord's analysis .

(CNN) Ronald Reagan's defining leadership moment came in 1987, when he demanded that his Cold War adversary ""tear down"" the Berlin Wall.

John F. Kennedy's happened after the Bay of Pigs disaster in 1961, when he admitted failure in a display of presidential accountability that caused his popularity to soar.

And Franklin Delano Roosevelt? His moment came a day after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. Standing before Congress in his steel leg braces, Roosevelt delivered a speech that made clear America's resilience and declared December 7, 1941 ""a date which will live in infamy.""

Successful presidents are many things, but above all they must be great leaders. They must possess clarity of vision and the communication skills to inspire and unite. Great leaders also surround themselves with strong advisers who have license to speak their minds, and they possess the emotional capacity to connect with the dreams and fears of those they lead.

I was privileged to serve under Reagan, whose ability to rally Americans on the home front while nimbly navigating the international stage remains unmatched.

Watching Donald Trump at the G20 gathering in Hamburg, Germany, this past week got me wondering -- does our current President have what it takes to lead the free world?

My conclusion, in a word, is no. What's worse, Trump has shown little interest in rising to the occasion and learning how to lead.

To be fair, there have been moments -- such as his recent speech in Poland, in which he reaffirmed US support for NATO and delivered a rare rebuke to Russia over its ""destabilizing activities in Ukraine"" -- that felt presidential. But far more often, Trump has conducted himself like an imperious adolescent, someone who believes he has all the answers and all the right moves, reality be damned.

This is disturbing on multiple levels, but let's start with the most basic -- the damage such behavior inflicts on America's security and standing in our complicated, highly connected world.

Trump's admirers often compare him to Reagan, noting that both men were straight-talking Washington outsiders underestimated by the political establishment. For many of us who worked for Reagan, this comparison is hardly accurate.

From the moment he took office, Reagan had a vision, and he doggedly stuck to it for eight years. Domestically, it was smaller government and lower taxes. Internationally, the mission was about defeating communism while spreading democracy and freedom for all.

Reagan was, of course, an ardent defender of American greatness -- remember the ""shining city upon a hill?"" -- and he understood that world peace depended on a strong United States. But his nationalistic pride never turned boastful on the world stage. He was restrained in his use of force, and he understood diplomacy and the importance of allies.

Trump, meanwhile, has pursued a foreign policy that is utterly incoherent, characterized by bullying, bragging and impetuousness.

There was the January raid on Yemen, ordered with little preparation or coordination. When the operation went poorly, Trump refused to take responsibility and blamed ""the generals"" for the death of Navy SEAL William ""Ryan"" Owens.

Then came the cruise missile strike against Syria, which Trump reportedly ordered after seeing TV images of children killed and sickened by a chemical attack authorized by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

The bombing did little to change the tragic realities in Syria. In fact, CNN reports that the Syrian air base the United States struck was up and running shortly after.

And let's not forget Trump's appalling interactions with some of America's most important global partners. His testy phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia were downright bizarre, with Trump barking at Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull about a refugee agreement and boasting about the size of his electoral college win.

And Trump's initial meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany was awkward at best. Among other highlights, Trump ignored Merkel's request for a handshake from Oval Office photographers and made an odd quip about wiretapping that left Merkel visibly puzzled.

With regard to Asia, the administration's zigging and zagging has been particularly perilous. Under President Barack Obama, the United States undertook a delicate rebalancing of Asian relations that included the negotiation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multilateral trade deal that would have created new opportunities for US exporters in agriculture, services and high-end manufacturing, as well as other economic benefits.

Trump tore that up, and his approach to China has ranged from vague Twitter threats to what looked like a budding bromance with President Xi Jinping at a Mar-a-Lago meeting in April. After North Korea launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile on July 4, Trump did another 360, taking to Twitter to criticize China for not doing enough -- even though the country is integral to efforts to rein in Kim Jong Un.

The costs of his errant judgment were plain to see at the G20 summit, where our most important economic and strategic allies effectively ostracized the United States on everything from trade to climate change and immigration. It is true that Trump held bilateral meetings with the leaders of Britain, China and Turkey, as well as a highly anticipated tete-a-tete with Russia's Vladimir Putin. But those meetings could not alter the fact that Trump's protectionist ""America first"" crusade has left the United States isolated.

Watching the spectacle from afar, I found myself missing the Gipper. During Reagan's first term, he talked tough and even engaged in a bit of name-calling -- dubbing the Soviet Union the ""evil empire"" -- while wrestling with his biggest foreign policy challenge. He was also a fervent critic of arms control during the height of the nuclear arms race.

But by his second term, Reagan was engaged in a crucial disarmament dialogue with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. Reagan saw that Gorbachev's goals could benefit American interests, so he dialed back his hawkish impulses to begin a more pragmatic, mutually respectful relationship with the Soviet leader.

That was Reagan's way -- adapt when necessary and press forward with optimism. And it paid off handsomely for our nation, not just with a reduced nuclear arsenal but through stabilization of Social Security, a strong Federal Reserve, low inflation and tax cuts.

Will Trump eventually understand that true leadership is about more than chest thumping and arrogant posturing?

I'm not holding my breath.

Trump has shown that a leadership style that might have worked during his previous life as a corporate czar does not translate well in the White House. Unable or unwilling to change, Trump continues to behave as if things should go his way just because he says so."

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-05/can-millennials-save-the-motorcycle-industry,Missing,"For Fed Pacheco, it was a long journey from motocurious to motorcyclist.There was a ride years ago in Texas on his uncles Suzuki Boulevard, not long after Pacheco had emigrated from Venezuela. A few years later, he decided to take a riding course and got his motorcycle license, though he still didnt pull the trigger. But when Honda unveiled its new Rebel 500 in November, the 27-year-old finally went all in.I just started obsessing about it, to be honest, he said. The riding season was coming up and I thought You know what? Maybe, its not that crazy. Pacheco traced one of the first Rebels on the market to a dealership in New Jersey, walked in and paid $6,800 on the spot. The bike was still in its shipping box.Hondas Rebel is the latest entry in a parade of new bikes designed for first-time riders; almost every company in the motorcycle industry has scrambled to make one. They are smaller, lighter, and more affordable than most everything else at a dealership and probably wouldnt look out of place in the 1960sback when motorcycling was about the ride, not necessarily the bike. They are also bait for millennials, meant to lure them  into the easy-rider lifestyle. If all goes as planned, these little rigs will help companies like Harley-Davidson coast for another 50 years.Theyre new motorcycles, but theyre also new thinking, said Mark Hoyer, editor-in-chief of Cycle World magazine. Theyre selling this perception of lifestyle ... its a cultural movement; a rebranding of the whole motorcycle industry.Its also the manufacturing equivalent of a mid-life crisis. Motorcycle sales in the U.S. peaked in 2006 at 716,268 and promptly started to skid. When the recession hit, the market went down hard. Bike sales fell by 41 percent in 2009 and another 14 percent the following year, according to the Motorcycle Industry Council. Thats not surprising considering the economy at the time: A motorcycle is a picture of discretionary spending, and they can be tricky to finance even in a healthy credit market. Even now, with the stock market on a historic bull run and after the U.S. auto industry posted its best year on record, traffic in motorcycle stores has stayed slow. In 2016, U.S. customers rolled off with 371,403 new bikes, roughly half as many as a decade ago.And then theres the generational time-bomb. In 2003, only about one-quarter of U.S. motorcycle riders were 50 or older. By 2014, it was close to half. The market has been cruising on a demographic that may only be able to buy one more bike. Suddenly, bike-makers desperately need new riders and millennials, apparently, are the best hope. Not only are there more of them than GenXers, but they have a longer expected lifetime value, which is corporate way of saying theyre a further away from needing a hip replacement. Around 2010, bikemakers made a major strategic shift: Sturgis was out; Coachella was in. They needed something cool to show on the wealthy, quasi-hipster music scene, something far from the fat-fendered, chrome-soaked hogs buzzing around South Dakota. Everybody is trying to do the same thing, said Lee Edmunds, manager of Hondas motorcycle marketing. Theyre all realizing they need to have more people come in at an entry-level stage.Harley-Davidson led the charge, perhaps because it dominates the U.S. market for large motorcycles and has the most to lose. Between 2006 and 2010, the number of big-engined Harleys registered in the U.S. plummeted by almost half. The company has hosted riding academies for first-timers since 2000, but it quickly ordered its engineers to design a true starter bike.Unveiled in 2013, the Street 500 resembles a conventional Harley in the way an Ivy League quarterback resembles an NFL lineman. The engine, just shy of 500cc, wont turn any heads in Daytona Beach or wake anyone up in suburbia. The seat sits relatively low to the ground and the whole package can be had for just under $7,000. The Street 500 quickly became the standard kit in Harleys riding schools, which churn out 65,000 new riders a year.There was a requirement to be more relevant to urban environments, said Anoop Prakash, the companys director of U.S. marketing. Prior to the Street, we certainly believed and knew many riders would start in another brand.At about the same time, Kawasaki launched its Ninja 300, a subdued version of its famous sport bike. It has the same angry wasp styling, albeit with a much smaller powerplant and pricetag$5,000; anti-lock brakes could be had for $300 more.A post shared by Scrambler Ducati (@scramblerducati) on Mar 2, 2017 at 5:56am PSTIn 2014, Ducati joined the first-timer fray with its Scrambler, resurrecting a sub-brand that it last made in 1974. The contemporary version is essentially an 803cc engine wrapped in six different trims, from a no-frills Classic to a stripped down café racer. The engineering lends itself to tinkering and Ducati encourages buyers to customize their Scramblers with add-on elements.We call it a naked bike, said Jason Chinnock, chief executive of Ducati North America. It was trying to bring something to market that had a nod to the nostalgia, but also the simpler way motorcycling was approached in the 1970s.About a year later, BMW pulled the cover off its G 310 R, a tidy, 350-pound version of its famous touring bikes. Anti-lock brakes are standard, and with a sticker price of $4,750, its less expensive than adding smoke white merino leather to one of BMW's 7-series sedans.Finally, Honda rolled out the Rebel that Pacheco fell so hard for. Pacheco is cofounder of a Manhattan marketing shop called Hungry Studioits his job to know what a brand represents and what a product projects. In the end, the Honda felt more right to him than the Harley-Davidson that he learned to ride on. It didnt feel cheesy to me at all; it felt tasteful, he explained. And I could definitely tell they were advertising to people like me. Make no mistake, the economics on these bikes isnt great. Profit margins are far fatter on something like a Honda Gold Wing F6B, an 844-pound locomotive that starts at $20,500. But that swollen kit doesnt hold much street cred where Pacheco parks in Manhattan, in part because the folks buying those big cruisers are quickly transitioning from the roadhouse to the golf course.A post shared by Kristy Hayes (@purplehayes33) on Jun 21, 2017 at 4:30pm PDTThe problem, however, with this sudden industry pivot to younger customers is that it may be coming too late. For years, it was too easy to just keep building bigger, more powerful bikes. They got more complicated, more expensive and more intimidating, said Edmunds at Honda. For a long time, all the manufacturers could do that, because that baby boomer market was so huge.Chinnock, at Ducati, calls it the horsepower game.The new breed of small bikes, meanwhile, has quickly become the most promising part of the business. Between 2011 and 2016, sales of motorcycles with engines smaller than 600cc increased by 11.8 percent, while bigger, more powerful bikes managed only a 7.4 percent gain.In its first full year its Scrambler was on the market, Ducati sold 15,000 of them28 percent of its total business. These riders were not looking at Scrambler as an entry to the world of Ducati; they looked at it as a whole new thing, Chinnock said. Its kind of one of those business mistakes youre OK with.Harley-Davidson, meanwhile, has a new marketing tagline: Nine bikes for under $12,000. Prakash, the marketing chief, breaks it down to $6 a day. Skip the latte; buy a bike. "

The region's Nepali-speaking Gorkha community has since last month held protests demanding a separate state, Gorkhaland, within India to protect their Himalayan culture. They have regularly clashed with the police. Seven civilians have died while dozens of security personnel have been injured.  The eastern state of West Bengal, where the tea-growing region of Darjeeling is located, has deployed troops to keep the peace, the second time in three weeks, an army spokesman said.  The killing on late Friday of 31-year old Tashi Bhutia, a supporter of Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) - one of the two political parties leading the protest - led to escalation of the violence in the tourist town.  A senior police officer in Darjeeling said Bhutia might have been killed in a cross firing when security forces were attacked. The officer did not wish to be named. The protesters also torched Sonada railway station - a UNESCO-listed heritage site - while sporadic incidents of violence in various other parts of the town ensued.  The unrest in the region has also hurt economically with trade and business completely shut down and disrupting exports of ""second flush"" tea crop, one of the world's most expensive  tea exclusively produced in Darjeeling.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wanda-sunac-china-m-a-idUSKBN19V06E,"CHINA'S WANDA STEPS BACK FROM THEME PARK, HOTEL DRIVE WITH $9.3 BILLION SUNAC DEAL","HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese property giant Dalian Wanda Group plans to sell tourism projects and hotels in the country to Sunac China (1918.HK) for $9.3 billion, as it dials back its theme-park ambitions and brings down its debt pile. The sale - the second-biggest real estate deal ever in China according to Reuters data - will help strengthen Wanda's case for a mainland listing after its property unit delisted from Hong Kong last year. For Sunac, it would mean ownership of a wide portfolio of tourism developments at a time when it is  spending billions on property and technology assets. Wanda said it would offload 91 percent of thirteen cultural tourism projects, which usually include theme parks and leisure complexes, and 76 hotels to the acquisitive Tianjin-based developer Sunac for 63.18 billion yuan. After the sale, Wanda will, however, continue to play a role in operating and managing the projects. Wanda, which also has interests in films and sports, had plans to build at least 20 cultural projects around China. Its billionaire owner Wang Jianlin had last year said his ""wolf pack"" of parks would beat U.S. rival Walt Disney Co (DIS.N). ""This (deal) signifies a retreat from Wanda's previous strategy in cultural tourism, and marks a pivot to an asset-light strategy,"" said Qin Gang, senior researcher at State Information Center, a government-linked think tank. Beijing has been encouraging development of cultural theme parks as part of a local tourism drive, tapping consumers' growing budget for entertainment. There are over 300 such facilities in China, with most struggling to turn a profit. Wanda's parks are still under construction, except three that have been completed. Two that opened in Nanchang and Hefei last year do not rank in the top 20 by attendance for Asia Pacific, consultancy AECOM's 2016 theme park index shows.  The firm, which had earmarked a more than 300 billion yuan ($44 billion) investment for its cultural and tourism projects, did not give a reason for the sale to Sunac, but local business magazine Caixin quoted Wang as saying the deal would ease the debt burden on Wanda's property unit. ""Through this asset transfer, Wanda Commercial's debt ratio will be greatly reduced, all the proceeds will be used to repay loans. Wanda Commercial plans to repay most of the bank loans this year,"" Wang told Caixin. Analysts said the lower debt load could help Wanda's plans to list the unit in Shanghai and to attract a higher valuation. S&P downgraded Wanda Commercial in December citing rising financial leverage and slower-than-expected asset disposal at China's largest commercial developer. Another downgrade would push the rating into ""junk"" category. The group has been investing heavily in entertainment, leisure and financial businesses and the buying spree has drawn the attention of Chinese regulators, who ordered lenders last month to assess exposure to overseas deals by Wanda, HNA Group, Anbang Insurance [ANBANG.UL] and Fosun (0656.HK). Wanda has been very active globally, with deals for U.S. cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (AMC.N), Hollywood film studio Legendary Entertainment, Infront Sports & Media AG and Spanish soccer team Atletico Madrid.  Sunac too has been shopping. In the past year, boss Sun Hongbin has led the group on an acquisition spree, including $2.1 billion for the real-estate assets of Legend Holdings, parent of PC-maker Lenovo, and $2.2 billion for a stake in Leshi Internet (300104.SZ), a unit of LeEco - a Chinese Netflix-to-Tesla-like conglomerate.  The stake in Wanda cultural and tourism projects will cost Sunac 29.58 billion yuan. The price tag for the hotels is 33.6 billion yuan. The firms are expected to sign an agreement by the end of this month.  Sunac will pay for this from its cashpile that stood at over 90 billion yuan at the end of June, Caixin quoted Sun as saying.  It had total liabilities of 168.6 billion yuan at the end of 2016, versus 64.5 billion yuan the year before.  Shares in Wanda Hotel Development (0169.HK) surged more than 150 percent after news of the deal, though none of the hotels being sold are included under this entity. Wanda said Sunac will be responsible for all the loans for the projects, but the brand name and design will be unchanged. Sunac, whose shares in Hong Kong were suspended from trading ahead of what it said would be a ""very substantial acquisition"" announcement, declined to comment further. Shares in the developer have more than doubled in value this year, but analysts worry Sunac could have bitten off too much. It has a negative outlook rating from Moody's, which said in April Sunac's leverage had deteriorated significantly due to large amounts of debt it had raised to support acquisitions.

The President can own his own legacy, members of the GOP Congress don't have to be involved

David Jolly is a former Republican congressman from Florida. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) With President Donald Trump's nonsensical Twitter approach to both domestic and foreign policy, his tweets regularly descending into depravity, congressional Republicans often find themselves facing the question: ""Do you agree with the President's irreverence and self-contradictions, and if not, what will you do to restore sanity -- to restore credibility, dignity?""

David Jolly

We have seen too many of them answer by remaining silent, or dodging, or merely offering their own 140-character criticism that distances themselves from the President. At best, those are attempts to quell the American people's anxiety over the President's behavior. At worst, they come across as affirmations of the public's suspicion that the GOP is only interested in self-preservation.

But in the eyes of many, to simply criticize the President and then immediately return to working with him is a tacit acceptance of his approach to a free press Ã¢ÂÂ which smacks of authoritarianism -- his subtle misogyny, and his perversion of what was once respected conservative ideology: He has turned it into a platform for self-promotion that draws its strength from our country's darkest angels.

It is fair for both the media and concerned voters to demand more: a tangible, substantive GOP strategy that honestly confronts the President's waywardness in policy and personal integrity.

Congressional Republicans' response should be this: Ignore the President. Isolate him.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/07/health/resistant-gonorrhea-antibiotics/index.html,THIS STD IS BECOMING 'SMARTER' AND HARDER TO TREAT,"(CNN) Gonorrhea is becoming harder and in some cases impossible to treat with antibiotics, the World Health Organization said.

""The bacteria that cause gonorrhea are particularly smart. Every time we use a new class of antibiotics to treat the infection, the bacteria evolve to resist them,"" said Teodora Wi, a human reproduction specialist at the WHO, in a news release.

Three superbugs -- bacteria that cannot be killed by the best available drug -- were detected in Japan, France and Spain, according to the WHO.

""We need to be more vigilant now,"" Wi told reporters in a phone briefing.

Each year, about 78 million people worldwide are infected with gonorrhea , the WHO said. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there are 820,000 new gonorrhea infections each year.

Data from 77 countries collected by WHO shows there is a widespread resistance to older, cheaper antibiotics and in some countries, the infection has became ""untreatable by all known antibiotics,"" the international health organization said in the news release.

Earlier this year, gonorrhea was named among 11 types of bacteria that health experts believe pose the greatest threats to human health because they are in urgent need of new antibiotics.

Marc Sprenger, WHO's director of antimicrobial resistance, said there's an urgent need for drugs and tests to prevent, diagnose and treat gonorrhea.

More specifically, Sprenger said, the health community needs new antibiotics, a long term vaccine to prevent the infection and tests that will predict with accuracy if an antibiotic will work on a particular infection.

Gonorrhea has developed resistance to nearly every class of antibiotics used to treat it such as penicillin, tetracycline and fluoroquinolones, the CDC said.

""It's important to understand that ever since antibiotics appeared on the scene, Neisseria gonorrhoeae has been fairly quick in developing resistance to all the classes of antibiotics that have been thrown at it,"" Manica Balasegaram, director of the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership, told reporters.

From 2009-2014 the WHO says that several countries discovered a widespread resistance to drugs used to treat gonorrhea like ciprofloxacin, azithromycin and even last resort treatments such as extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs), the health organization said.

In 2016, the organization began advising doctors to switch to a two-drug combination: ceftriaxone and azithromycin after more than 50 countries reported that ESCs were no longer effective in some cases.

Why drugs stop working?

The sexually transmitted infection is becoming resistant to the usual recommended treatments around the world and creating new antibiotics is ""not very attractive for commercial pharmaceutical companies,"" the WHO said.

Gonorrhea symptoms include a burning sensation when urinating and unusual discharge from the penis or vagina. Left untreated, the infection can cause serious health problems including long-term abdominal pain and pelvic inflammatory disease, which could lead to ectopic pregnancy and infertility.

But most people who are infected do not have any symptoms and in some cases, doctors mistakenly diagnose gonorrhea, health officials said.

Using antibiotics improperly is contributing to the development of antibiotic resistance in gonorrhea as well as other bacterial diseases, health officials said.

In the US, the CDC recommends a two-drug regimen -- ceftriaxone and azithromycin -- for treating gonorrhea.

Last year, a cluster of infections in Hawaii did not succumb as easily to the antibiotics as infections have in the past.

""Since 2005, we have seen four isolated cases that showed resistance to both drugs. But the Hawaii cases are the first cluster we have seen with reduced susceptibility to both drugs,"" said Paul Fulton Jr., a spokesman for the CDC."

To date, no fires tied to the defect have been reported to NHTSA or Continental, spokesmen for the company and the agency said.Mary Arraf, a U.S. spokeswoman for Continental, said the parts were made from the same type of industry-standard plastic called polyoxymethylen-copolymer. She said in the recalled vehicles, the material can break down due to environmental factors and exposure to acids in cleaning solutions, and that the risk of a crack can also be affected by where the part is installed in a vehicle.Its too early to estimate how many additional vehicles may need to be recalled but the situation highlights how one faulty part can ripple risk throughout the auto industry, said Dave Sullivan, an analyst with consultancy AutoPacific Inc.Thats kind of what the story of the whole auto industry is, Sullivan said. Consolidation has happened and theres a race for cheaper parts that are shared across more vehicles.The recalls so far affect certain Porsche Macan, Audi Q5, Audi Q7 and VW Touareg SUVs sold over the last decade. The fuel pump flange is generally mounted in the fuel tank and closes an opening used to mount other fuel and vapor management.The other companies Continental supplied the fuel pump flanges to were McLaren Automotive Ltd., Automobili Lamborghini SpA, Volvo Car Group and suppliers Magna International Inc., TI Automotive Ltd., Plastic Omnium, YAPP USA Automotive Systems Inc. and Kautex Textron GmbH.Continentals Arraf said the company is communicating with all of its potentially impacted customers and has not heard of any flanges leaking on vehicles other than those produced by VW, Porsche and Audi.A spokeswoman for Volkswagens U.S. unit didnt immediately respond to an email seeking comment."

""Having known Dr. Fitzgerald for many years, I know that she has a deep appreciation and understanding of medicine, public health, policy and leadership,"" said a statement from Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who nominated Fitzgerald.

Fitzgerald, an obstetrician-gynecologist, was appointed to lead the Georgia Department of Public Health in 2011 by Gov. Nathan Deal. While there, she oversaw programs to combat childhood obesity, increase vaccination rates and track Alzheimer's and dementia , according to the department.

Her tenure as health commissioner was also marked by several high-profile cases of Americans infected with the Ebola virus, who were flown to Atlanta for treatment.

""Ebola was arriving in our own backyard in Atlanta, and with it came the fears,"" Fitzgerald wrote in the Journal of the Georgia Public Health Association. ""The fiction and distorted truths about Ebola were spreading faster than the disease itself -- and farther.""

Under her stewardship, the Department of Public Health developed a plan for monitoring and testing people who risked being exposed to the virus. The department also sought to provide information on Ebola to the public. However, confusion emerged when Deal claimed that water killed the Ebola virus -- an incorrect statement he attributed to Fitzgerald, who advocated for handwashing.

""She admits she misinformed me as she briefed me initially, but she is a very competent individual,"" Deal said during a 2014 gubernatorial debate.

Although handwashing is an important part of preventing the spread of Ebola, water and regular soaps are not thought to inactivate the virus itself. Researchers note that there is limited research specifically on handwashing and the Ebola virus.

Fitzgerald ran for Congress in 1992 and 1994 and lost both times. She ran as a Republican to represent Georgia's seventh district.

She has also donated to Price's congressional campaigns on at least three occasions, according to records from the Federal Election Commission. Her new boss represented Georgia's 6th congressional district before he was appointed by President Donald Trump to lead the Health and Human Services Department. That agency did not respond to a request for comment.

During her 1994 run for Congress, which she lost to Bob Barr in the primaries, abortion emerged as a major issue. Fitzgerald denied that she had ever performed abortions, despite her opponent suggesting otherwise, according to reporting by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. She said that she supported certain restrictions on abortion, such as parental notification, but that ultimately the decision should be made between a woman and her doctor, the AJC reported.

Fitzgerald has written several guest columns for the AJC, covering topics such as Georgia's cannabis registry and early immunization.

""As a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist, I have seen the devastating and painful effects of whooping cough and other vaccine-preventable diseases,"" she wrote for the paper in 2014. ""I am a mother. I am vaccinated.""

Fitzgerald received her medical degree and completed her training at Emory University. She is also a major in the US Air Force and served as a health care policy adviser for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, according to her biography.

The CDC faces a 12% funding cut under the Republican health bill. This is due to the proposed elimination of the Prevention and Public Health Fund , whose funding under the current law is expected to rise from $900 million in 2018 to $2 billion in 2025, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The fund supports specialized services for people with Alzheimer's disease, state and local planning for infectious disease threats and programs geared at preventing childhood lead poisoning.

Fitzgerald will succeed acting director Dr. Anne Schuchat, who took over when Dr. Tom Frieden resigned from the post in January."
http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/10/politics/trump-knowledge-meeting-natalia-veselnitskaya/index.html,WHITE HOUSE: TRUMP DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT HIS SON'S MEETING WITH RUSSIAN LAWYER,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump only recently learned of the meeting between a Russian lawyer and three of his top campaign officials, including his son Donald Trump, Jr., a White House spokeswoman said Monday.

Trump learned of the meeting ""in the last couple of days,"" Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, describing the meeting Trump's son, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Natalia Veselnitskaya, as ""very short"" with ""absolutely no follow up.""

""The only thing I see inappropriate about the meeting was the people who leaked the information on the meeting after it was voluntarily disclosed,"" Sanders said, slamming leaks and later the Democratic National Committee.

The White House statement echoed what Mark Corallo, a spokesman for the President's legal team, said on Sunday.

""The President was not aware of, and did not attend, the meeting,"" he said.

Vice President Mike Pence was also unaware of the meeting until recently, a spokesman told CNN on Monday.

""The vice president was not aware of the meeting,"" said Marc Lotter, Pence's spokesman. ""He is not focused on stories about the campaign, particularly stories about the time before he joined the ticket.""

The meeting with Trump's son and campaign officials happened on June 9, 2016, over a month before Pence -- then Indiana's governor -- joined the Trump campaign on July 15.

Pence, in an interview with CBS News, said ""of course"" no one from the campaign met with Russians trying to meddle in the election.

""Did any adviser or anybody in the Trump campaign have any contact with the Russians who were trying to meddle in the election?"" CBS' John Dickerson asked on January 15.

""Of course not,"" Pence replied. ""And I think to suggest that is to give credence to some of these bizarre rumors that have swirled around the candidacy.""

Donald Trump Jr., in response to a New York Times story about his meeting, said on Saturday that his meeting with Veselnitskaya was primarily about ""adoptions.""

But the President's son and operator of the family's business said in response to another Saturday New York Times report that the meeting was, in part, to gain damaging information about Hillary Clinton.

""After pleasantries were exchanged, the woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton,"" Trump Jr. said in a statement. ""Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.""

The meeting later pivoted, Trump's son said, to adoptions and a US law known as the Magnitsky Act, which allows the US to withhold visas and freeze the assets of Russians thought to have violated human rights.

Sanders said later in the briefing that Trump's son ""did not collude with anybody to influence the election.""

Asked if it was normal and standard practice during the campaign to have meeting like the one Trump Jr. had.

""I don't know any other meetings with Don Jr. but I also haven't had an extensive conversation with him,"" Sanders added.

The meeting -- and its revelation -- underscores how the swirl of stories about Russia continues here in Washington, even after Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the G20 in Hamburg, Germany. White House aides had hoped that the meeting between the two world leaders would have helped stem the stream of stories, but were greeted by the New York Times report when they touched down in Washington after the foreign trip.

A spokesperson for Donald Trump Jr. confirms the first son has now hired Washington attorney Alan Futerfas to represent him in the ongoing matters.

Veselnitskaya founded a group that sought to remove Moscow's ban on the adoption of Russian children by US citizens.

Clinton's former campaign chairman, John Podesta, looked to ridicule Trump on Monday when he tweeted about the fact Trump didn't know about the meeting at the time.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-virginia-klan-idUSKBN19T142,KLAN MEMBERS RALLY AGAINST REMOVAL OF GENERAL LEE STATUE IN VIRGINIA,"(Reuters) - A few dozen Ku Klux Klan members and supporters shouted ""white power"" at a rally on Saturday in Charlottesville, Virginia where they protested against a city council decision to remove a statute honoring Confederate General Robert E. Lee. The group was guarded by scores of police and outnumbered by hundreds of counter-protesters who waved signs denouncing racism. Anti-KKK protesters raised their voices in chants and shouts, drowning out speeches from the white supremacists, live video feeds on social media showed. There were no initial reports of violence at the rally that lasted less than an hour. The Klan group that brandished Confederate flags and signs with anti-Semitic messages was separated from crowds by a ring of fencing and a heavy police presence. Later police fired tear gas cannisters when some protesters refused orders to disperse. Twenty-three people were arrested, but officials could not confirm their affiliations. In February, the Charlottesville City Council voted 3-2 to remove the statue from the park once named for Lee and make plans for a new memorial to remember the southern city's enslaved population, The Daily Progress, the local newspaper reported.  At least one person who participated in the Klan rally against the statute removal could be seen with a holstered pistol. Confederacy statues and flags have been removed from public spaces across the United States since 2015, after a white supremacist murdered nine black parishioners at a South Carolina church. Critics of the monuments say they foster racism by celebrating leaders of the Confederacy in the pro-slavery South during the U.S. Civil War. Supporters say they represent an indelible part of U.S. history and part of regional heritage. The bronze figures of Lee and his horse, Traveller, atop an oval-shaped granite pedestal has been in the park for nearly a century, the city of Charlottesville said. Torch-wielding white nationalists rallied in the college town that is home to the University of Virginia's flagship campus in May to protest the move. A legal battle is going on over the statue's removal and no date has been set. Reporting by Jon Herskovitz and Chris Michaud; Editing by Alistair Bell and Himani Sarkar"

But it sure needs to.The Culver City, California-based unit of Sony Corp. is in seventh place at the box office, a lowly spot the studio hasnt occupied since 2000. And Spider-Man: Homecoming, Sonys sixth film about the Marvel superhero, represents the companys best chance to create a mega hit and lay the foundation for action films scheduled out to 2019.Its as important as any film they have released in the past 10 years, said Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co. It is the last major franchise they have.After starting 2017 with a $1 billion write-off and the departure of Michael Lynton, who led the Tokyo-based companys U.S. film, TV and music businesses, Sonys entertainment unit needs to start making hit films again. Last years Ghostbusters revival failed and was followed by disappointments including the star-studded Passengers. Rothman, 62, came in more than two years ago after a hacking scandal toppled former studio chief Amy Pascal.Spider-Man: Homecoming marks a chance to get back in the right direction. The picture starring 21-year-old Tom Holland could debut with sales of $122 million in North America this weekend, analysts at BoxOfficePro.com said. Sony is offering a more conservative $80 million.The movie generated $15.4 million from its night of previews, according to the studio, shy of the $15.6 million Iron Man 3 registered, to be the sixth-biggest tally for Marvel from early Thursday showings. Sony shares slid 0.3 percent to close at 4,245 yen in Tokyo on Friday.Rothman, who came to Sony from 20th Century Fox, has reason to be cautious. Many studios well-known series have failed to meet expectations this year and U.S. moviegoers are showing signs of fatigue with superhero sequels. While Spider-Man has been one of the most popular film characters from the comic book world, the most recent movies havent measured up.The first Spider-Man in 2002, starring Tobey Maguire and directed by Sam Raimi, was an unqualified hit, garnering upbeat reviews and global sales of $822 million on a production budget of $139 million, according to Box Office Mojo. By the last picture in 2014 -- the second featuring Andrew Garfield -- reviews had turned mixed, the budget had swelled past $265 million, according to the Hollywood Reporter, and ticket sales totaled $709 million.For this go-round, Sony turned to Walt Disney Co., recruiting the president of its successful Marvel division, Kevin Feige, as a producer. The company agreed to weave Spider-Man into a larger Marvel storyline featuring many superheroes, while Disney won rights to use the character in movies of its own. Disney retained merchandising rights and could benefit from toy sales linked to the movie.And costs have come down: the budget for the new film was $175 million, according to Sony.It was very much run like a Marvel Studios production, Feige told reporters in April.Success would put future Sony superhero films on firmer ground. These include a 2018 release based on the character Venom, featuring Tom Hardy, along with an animated Spider-Man. The studio also plans a feature with female leads based on Black Cat and Silver Sable. As part of the deal with Disney, Feige will produce a Spider-Man sequel due out in 2019. Pascal, a producer on Spider-Man: Homecoming, will be part of that effort, too.The new Spider-Man continues a story introduced in last years Disney movie Captain America: Civil War, which brought in $1.15 billion in worldwide. It will extend through next years Infinity Wars and possibly another Avengers movie.Hollands introduction began a trajectory of excitement that started over a year ago, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior analyst at ComScore Inc.Homecoming finds Spider-Mans alter-ego Peter Parker in high school in Queens, living with Aunt May, played by Marisa Tomei. Joined by Robert Downey Jr. as billionaire Tony Stark/Iron Man, Spider-Man takes on the evil villain Vulture, played by Michael Keaton. Spider-Man: Homecoming generated 93 percent positive reviews, according to aggregator Rottentomatoes.com, the second best in the series.That will be good news to Sony Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai, who has been at the Culver City studio a lot this year after naming Anthony Vinciquerra to replace Lynton as Rothmans boss. Hirai has been publicly emphatic Sony is committed to its entertainment group.While stuck in seventh place, Sony has had a modest success this year with the heist movie Baby Driver and could have a hit with the The Emoji Movie, due July 28. The first of a new series of Stephen King adaptations, featuring Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the Dark Tower, is scheduled for next month. Other remakes are also on the horizon, such as Flatliners and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.And the studio is contending for future rights to the James Bond movie series. Sony generated $3.17 billion in worldwide box-office sales with the previous four spy films, going back to 2006s Casino Royale.With parent Sony Corp.s diverse businesses spanning electronics and video games, as well an entertainment, a single movie wont make or break the company. But they really need a win here, said Paul Sweeney, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst.To compete in the global film market, Sony will have to have a recurring number of tentpole franchises that you can bring out every year, Sweeney said. Two or three bankable franchises that you can go back to every couple years and you try to get lucky with some of the other ones."

http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/10/politics/trump-ends-cyber-security-plan-putin/index.html,TRUMP'S 'CYBER SECURITY UNIT' PLAN WITH PUTIN,"Washington (CNN) Donald Trump's plan to work with Russia's Vladimir Putin on cybersecurity died an unceremonious death , ending in under 140 characters roughly 12 hours after the US President last defended it.

The abrupt move signaled once again that Trump has no qualms about changing his mind when a policy position brings the White House critical coverage, and in the process undermining some of his top staff and Cabinet members.

Trump's top aides -- including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin -- touted an agreement to cooperate with Russia on cybersecurity as one of the key wins that came out of Trump's meeting with Putin on the sidelines of the G20 in Hamburg, Germany. Speaking with reporters after the meeting, Tillerson, Mnuchin and others hyped the agreement as a step forward for US-Russia relations.

Trump spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders downplayed the formerly touted plan by saying it was a discussion without ""formal structure in place"" for the cooperation.

""This was part of a discussion in that meeting, and look, we recognize that Russia is a cyber threat but we also recognize the need to have conversations with our adversaries,"" Sanders said, adding that she didn't ask Trump whether he trusts Putin.

GOP criticism

But many, including Republicans, didn't see it that way -- South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham called it ""pretty close"" to the ""dumbest idea I've ever heard.""

""Partnering with Putin,"" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted in response to Trump, ""on a 'Cyber Security Unit' is akin to partnering with Assad on a ""Chemical Weapons Unit.""

Partnering with Putin on a ""Cyber Security Unit"" is akin to partnering with Assad on a ""Chemical Weapons Unit"". 2/3 Ã¢ÂÂ Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) July 9, 2017

The concerns were clear to these Republicans: Working with Russia to protect cybersecurity would likely mean having intelligence officers who blamed Russia for 2016 election meddling in an unclassified report work directly with the Russians to stop any future meddling.

As pressure mounted, Trump responded. A mere 12 hours after the President himself touted the initiative on Twitter, Trump pulled the plug on the ill-fated agreement.

The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit doesn't mean I think it can happen. It can't-but a ceasefire can,& did! Ã¢ÂÂ Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 10, 2017

""The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit doesn't mean I think it can happen,"" Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday night. ""It can't-but a ceasefire can,& did!""

The tweet directly contradicted what Tillerson, Mnuchin -- and even Trump himself -- said earlier.

""Putin & I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit so that election hacking, & many other negative things, will be guarded and safe,"" Trump wrote early on Sunday.

Putin & I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit so that election hacking, & many other negative things, will be guarded.. Ã¢ÂÂ Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 9, 2017

...and safe. Questions were asked about why the CIA & FBI had to ask the DNC 13 times for their SERVER, and were rejected, still don't.... Ã¢ÂÂ Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 9, 2017

Billed as a win

Trump's aides championed the proposal after the high-stakes Trump-Putin meeting.

""The two leaders also acknowledged the challenges of cyberthreats and interference in the democratic processes of the United States and other countries, and agreed to explore creating a framework around which the two countries can work together to better understand how to deal with these cyber threats,"" Tillerson said during a briefing with reporters after the confab, adding the group will look into ""who to hold accountable"" for cyberintrusion.

And Mnuchin, during an interview with ABC on Sunday, said the group would focus on ""having capabilities to make sure that we both fight cyber together.""

""I think this is a very important step forward that what we want to make sure is that we coordinate with Russia, that we're focused on cybersecurity together, that we make sure that they never interfere in any democratic elections or conduct any cybersecurity,"" Mnuchin said.

Undercutting aides

The short life of Trump's cybersecurity partnership with Putin is the latest example of the President undercutting his top aides to stem negative press.

After reports surfaced in May that Trump shared classified information with the Russian foreign minister and ambassador in the Oval Office, deputy national security adviser Dina Powell said the story was ""false.""

Hours later, though, Trump tweeted tacit confirmation of the report.

""As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety,"" he wrote. ""Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism.""

...to terrorism and airline flight safety. Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism. Ã¢ÂÂ Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2017

Earlier this year, too, Trump countered the explanation his aides offered for why he decided to fire FBI Director James Comey.

After aides initially argued that Comey was fired for his handling of Hillary Clinton's email issue during the 2016 election and a recommendation memo written by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, Trump told NBC News that he considered the FBI investigation into the Trump campaign's connections to Russian meddling when he decided to fire the former FBI director.

""I was going to fire regardless of recommendation,"" Trump said in the interview, adding later, ""When I decided to (dismiss Comey), I said to myself, I said you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story."""

http://cnn.com/travel/article/australia-cattle-chocolate-wagyu-beef/index.html,AUSTRALIAN CATTLE EAT CHOCOLATE TO MAKE WAGYU BEEF - CNN.COM,"Chris Dwyer, CNN Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Updated 11th July 2017

(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ It's the only flight I've ever been on where the attendant walked down the narrow aisle holding a notepad asking, ""Does anyone need a taxi booking for when we land?""

As introductions go to this quiet corner of South Australia, it speaks volumes. This is a part of the world where friendliness comes as standard, where people will do anything for a neighbor -- or a stranger. At the tiny regional airport of Mount Gambier, where only a handful of flights come and go each day, it also stretches to ensuring no one waits too long for a cab on arrival.

Mount Gambier lies almost halfway between the cities of Melbourne and Adelaide. It's the biggest town around for more than 200 miles but has a population of fewer than 30,000.

That means that there's an awful lot of countryside and coastline, providing the perfect backdrop for award-winning local produce including Coonawarra wines, rock lobster and the much sought-after sea snail known as abalone, the world's most valuable shellfish.

The region's most famed culinary export, however, is high-end Wagyu beef from cattle that are partly fed, toward the ends of their lives, on an unusual mixture of sweet treats: chocolate, candy and cookies.

Winning approach

Cattle in the Mount Gambier region have an interesting diet.

You read that right. It's a distinctive but successful approach, imparting a unique taste to the super-premium meat from Mayura Station that draws fans thanks to its remarkable flavor and lineage.

Mayura Station -- ranches are known as stations in Australia -- sits in picturesque and gently rolling green hills that are frequently carpeted in yellow flowers. It's located just a few miles from the coast, meaning cooling sea breezes offer welcome respite from the often intense heat.

An aquifer provides water purified through natural filtration through limestone caves and caverns that act as large natural filters. Combine that with the cleanest air you can imagine and consistent weather patterns, and you can see why there's a real sense of terroir. That's the French term for a location's particular ecosystem which helps make wines -- or other things such as beef -- so distinctive.

Mayura Station is an Australian ranch known for its distinctive approach to rearing cows.

Mayura Station has been farmed in some form since 1845, but today only 20 people work across the entire property of more than 3,000 hectares. It's tiny compared with some Australian cattle ranches, such as Anna Creek Station, which covers a mind-blowing 6,000,000 acres -- roughly the same size as Israel.

""Wagyu"" translates simply as ""Japanese cow."" The animals trace their lineage back to beasts of burden used for heavy labor, often in rice paddies. There are two main types, black and red, with black known as being the highest quality. Mayura Station's cattle originally came from Shogo Takeda, seen as Japan's foremost breeder and someone who has more than 50 years experience behind him.

All cattle at Mayura are full-blood Wagyu.

At Mayura the cattle are full-blood Wagyu, single source, meaning that both parents are 100% Wagyu blood. If they don't breed it on the farm, they don't sell it.

The key difference, however, compared with beef anywhere else in the world, is that for the last two months of their lives Mayura feed their animals around 2 kilograms of chocolate, cookies and candy every day.

They grow more than 70% of their regular feed on site, a mix of wheat, hay, rye grass, maize and broad beans. But the sweet mixture comes from recently expired or imperfect batches from factories, including the popular Cadbury's brand.

Unique flavor

The cows are fed on a mixture of chocolate, candy and cookies.

Up close, it smells great -- good enough to eat.

Mayura Station owner Scott de Bruin tells me to take a few bits between my fingers and try it. I assume he's kidding. But no -- and it's surprisingly moist, subtly sweet. A bit dusty, but otherwise not bad.

""When I first started feeding it to the cattle, people would say, 'your beef has this really unique flavor, we love it,' "" de Bruin says. ""I always thought it was due to the region here, or because people hadn't tried full-blood Wagyu.

""They both contribute to the taste -- but the sweet mix is undoubtedly the biggest part. The cattle just love it. They definitely know when it's feeding time!""

By the time the cattle get to eat the sweet mixture, they've stopped growing and are no longer putting on weight, so the feed is 100% about the flavor.

Resident Chef Mark Wright at work in the Tasting Room's Kitchen, at Mayura Station.

This is borne out in The Tasting Room , the simply named restaurant at Mayura Station open three days a week. The restrooms are labeled ""heifers"" on one door and ""bulls"" on the other, while cabinets on the wall feature beautiful selections of knives belonging to repeat diners.

A huge range and grill is the main draw and home to Chef Mark Wright, clearly in his element preparing some of the world's best meat. As he explains:

""From one carcass there are 32 different cuts of meat that all have very different flavor profiles and textures, so they need different styles of cooking or butchery.""

The beef is delicious -- and beautifully presented.

He plates up a succession of breathtaking dishes including a a sublime carpaccio, faultless tartare, but most of all the greatest cut of beef I'd never heard of. It's known as a ""blade"" or, in the industry, ""the butcher's cut"" -- because they know more than anyone else about the very best eating.

The whole animal is used at Mayura, in one way or another. From a 700 kilogram beast they produce approximately 300 kilograms of meat, only 30 kilograms of which are the top end cuts.

That goes some way to explaining the exclusivity -- and price -- which can reach upward of $300 per pound for their top-of-the-range Signature label. Genetics determine the all-important intense marbling that makes the beef almost more white than red, rich in omega 3, omega 6 and unsaturated fats. Not to mention the most tender you'll ever eat.

Worldwide appeal

This is one of Mark Wright's dishes, but the beef is served across the world, from Dubai to Hong Kong.

It's one thing to have cows eating candy, and some may dismiss it as cute marketing, but what does it really taste like? The last word goes to Chef Andrea Accordi at Hong Kong's Four Seasons Hotel:

""I've tried a lot of marbled meat, but sometimes the flavor isn't present. Mayura, however, gives a perfect balance of fat and meat. It's a very interesting and unique flavor, very nutty, and I feel the hint of chocolate.

""We cook it in The Lounge at Four Seasons Hotel Hong Kong between two layers of cedar wood."

Ferry services to the island were briefly shut down

(CNN) Police shot and killed a man Sunday morning who spent several hours firing a gun from a boat anchored off an island near Seattle.

The shooting ended an incident that had begun about 8:30 p.m. local time Saturday, Bainbridge Island Police Chief Matthew Hamner told CNN Sunday morning.

Police received calls about a man firing shots from a boat in Eagle Harbor onto the shore, he said. Officers originally thought someone was setting off fireworks, but callers began describing the type of gun the man was using, Hamner said.

Officials cleared the area and approached the subject around 1 a.m. As they neared, the man raised his gun toward officers and they shot and killed him, Hamner said.

No one else was injured, police said.

Ask about ""off-menu"" items, or custom-order your meal

(CNN) Ordering fast food can be tricky for people who are trying to eat healthfully, but it can be particularly challenging for vegetarians. Menus are often limited in vegetarian staples such as beans, lentils, whole grains and vegetables.

The good news is that more and more restaurants are catering to meatless customers, which now number approximately 8 million adults in the United States, with many more trying to eat less meat in general for health reasons.

""I am seeing more options out there for plant-based eaters who want to grab fast food,"" said Sharon Palmer, a vegetarian, nutritionist and author of ""Plant-Powered for Life.""

Vegetarian dining requires some careful planning, however. Here are some tips and strategies for eating well at fast food restaurants if you are a vegetarian or vegan:

Check out menus in advance. Since some chains have more vegetarian options than others, you should go online or try calling a restaurant to see whether there's something you will eat. If the menu seems limited, it may be worth traveling a bit farther if it means you'll get healthier, more appealing meatless options.

In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter , Ellis's family -- via his manager Emily Gerson Saines -- said they were prompted to share the details of the 39-year-old's death in hopes of helping others struggling with addiction.

""Nelsan has suffered with drug and alcohol abuse for years. After many stints in rehab, Nelsan attempted to withdraw from alcohol on his own,"" the statement said. ""According to his father, during his withdrawal from alcohol he had a blood infection, his kidneys shut down, his liver was swollen, his blood pressure plummeted, and his dear sweet heart raced out of control.""

Ellis, who played tell-it-like-it-is medium Lafayette on the HBO vampire drama, spent four days in the hospital leading up to his death on Saturday, which was initially said to be from heart failure.

""Nelsan was ashamed of his addiction and thus was reluctant to talk about it during his life,"" the statement added. ""His family, however, believes that in death he would want his life to serve as a cautionary tale in an attempt to help others."""
http://cnn.com/2017/07/06/politics/russia-steps-up-spying-efforts-after-election/index.html,RUSSIA STEPS UP SPYING EFFORTS AFTER ELECTION,"(CNN) Russian spies are ramping up their intelligence-gathering efforts in the US, according to current and former US intelligence officials who say they have noticed an increase since the election .

The officials say they believe one of the biggest US adversaries feels emboldened by the lack of a significant retaliatory response from both the Trump and Obama administrations.

""Russians have maintained an aggressive collection posture in the US, and their success in election meddling has not deterred them,"" said a former senior intelligence official familiar with Trump administration efforts.

Russians could also be seeking more information on Trump's administration, which is new and still unpredictable to Moscow, according to Steve Hall, retired CIA chief of operations.

""Whenever there is a deterioration of relations between countries Ã¢ÂÂ the espionage and intelligence collection part becomes that much more important as they try to determine the plans and intentions of the adversarial government,"" Hall said.

Since the November election, US intelligence and law enforcement agencies have detected an increase in suspected Russian intelligence officers entering the US under the guise of other business, according to multiple current and former senior US intelligence officials. The Russians are believed to now have nearly 150 suspected intelligence operatives in the US, these sources said. Officials who spoke to CNN say the Russians are replenishing their ranks after the US in December expelled 35 Russian diplomats suspected of spying in retaliation for election-meddling.

""The concerning point with Russia is the volume of people that are coming to the US. They have a lot more intelligence officers in the US"" compared to what they have in other countries, one of the former intelligence officials says.

The FBI, which is responsible for counterintelligence efforts in the US, would not comment for the story.

Fueling law enforcement officials' concern is that the Russians are targeting people in the US who can provide access to classified information, in addition to ongoing efforts to hack the US government for intelligence, according to several of the officials. In some cases, Russian spies have tried to gain employment at places with sensitive information as part of their intelligence-gathering efforts, the sources say.

But that hasn't stopped the State Department from issuing the temporary duty visas Ã¢ÂÂ also known as TDY Ã¢ÂÂ to the suspected Russian intelligence officers. US intelligence officials who spoke to CNN expressed concerns about the number of temporary visas the State Department has issued to Russian travelers. The issue is not a new one between State and intelligence but has continued even after the intelligence findings of Russia meddling in the US election.

A State Department official would not comment specifically on the visas that have been issued, citing confidentiality under the Immigration and Nationality Act, but said ""the United States is open to working with Russia where we can find areas of practical cooperation that will benefit the American people."" The official adds, ""Where we do not see eye to eye with Russia, the United States will continue to stand up for the interests and values of America, our allies and our partners.""

DHS would not comment on the Russia visas specifically but said there is an extensive process for granting visas.

""The visa process involves multiple security checks, including screening of applicants against a wide array of criminal and terrorist databases to verify the individual's identity and to detect derogatory information that might lead to an inadmissibility determination, as well as an in-person interview with the applicant,"" according to a statement explaining the process.

Former State Department spokesperson Rear Admiral John Kirby says it's a complicated issue.

""To deny a visa, there has to be concrete reasons to do it,"" said Kirby, a CNN military and diplomatic analyst. ""Sometimes they bring people over on legitimate business only, that's true. But sometimes the spies they send over here come wrapped inside the veneer of legitimate business. They blur those lines pretty well. And that's one way they try to get around the visa issue.""

In some cases, the FBI uses surveillance to track the suspected Russian intelligence officers as part of a counterintelligence effort. That's how the US was able to identify and expel the 35 Russian diplomats last December, officials explained. US law enforcement officials say some of the Russian diplomats have violated protocol by leaving the Washington, DC, area without notifying the State Department. Russia has similar rules in place for US diplomats in Russia.

The issue was alluded to in a recent exchange between Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Bill Priestap, the FBI's Assistant Director of the Counterintelligence Division, during a hearing about Russia on Capitol Hill. ""Does it complicate you and your agent's efforts to conduct your counterintelligence mission, to have Russian nationals wandering around the country more than 25 miles outside their duty assignment?"" Cotton asked. Priestap responded, ""Sure. If that were to happen, that would absolutely complicate our efforts.""

One flashpoint in US-Russia relations: The US shut down Russian diplomatic compounds in December that US officials believe were outfitted with sophisticated surveillance equipment targeting US military and civilian infrastructure. Russian officials have pressed the US to return the facilities in a bid to improve relations. One former administration official said that the US even watched as Russians removed suspected surveillance equipment from the compounds when they were evicted. Russia has denied the compounds were being used for intelligence gathering.

A spokesperson for the Russian embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.

Even after the meddling in the US elections in 2016, the US has been slow to take measures to respond to the intelligence threat, current and former US officials say.

Partisan political disagreements over the Russian activity -- and President Donald Trump's reluctance to accept intelligence conclusions about Russia's meddling in the election -- has slowed efforts to counter the threat, current and former officials say.

US intelligence is also uneasy about ongoing Russian efforts to infiltrate US infrastructure. At a May Senate hearing on national security threats, top intelligence officials expressed concerns that the widespread use of cyber-security software in the US made by Kaspersky Labs based in Moscow could be used as a tool to accomplish that. The Russian-based company's anti-virus products have become popular in the US consumer market.

But now US government agencies are concerned that Russian security services may be able to use the software for espionage or to help access otherwise secure networks, according to US officials briefed on the matter. Kaspersky products are also commonly used in equipment bought by US government agencies. The top officials from the FBI, CIA, Defense Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency all testified at the May hearing that they wouldn't allow Kaspersky software in their computer networks. But US government contractors may still use the products. The officials would not detail their concerns in an open hearing, citing the classified nature of the information.

Kaspersky has denied any ties to the Russian government and says it has never helped, and wouldn't assist, with any government's espionage efforts. In a statement to CNN, Kaspersky Lab says, ""As a private company, Kaspersky Lab has no ties to any government, and the company has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts."""

But history will be the true judge of his performance, writes Lord

Jeffrey Lord is a CNN political commentator. Previously, he served in the Reagan administration as a White House political adviser. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. For a counter perspective, read Doug Elmets' analysis.

(CNN) Presidents and summits -- whether with Russian leaders or European allies -- have an uneven history. In the case of President Donald Trump, reviews of his performance at the G20 remain consistently mixed: Trump critics hated his performance, while Trump fans loved it.

As a fan, I would give Trump an 11 out of 10. He did exactly what the people who voted for him wanted him to do. He never wavered from putting America first -- or, in campaign vernacular, making America great again -- whether the subject was climate change, trade or North Korea.

Jeffrey Lord

But history shows us no meeting goes perfectly -- and sometimes it can be difficult to gauge the success of a meeting until years later.

The moments when presidents sit down with their Russian counterparts have always drawn particularly close attention. This practice began during World War II, when Franklin Delano Roosevelt attended two meetings with the Soviet Union's Josef Stalin and Britain's Winston Churchill.

The first meeting didn't occur until the late 1943 Tehran Summit. It is notable that to break the ice with Stalin, Roosevelt found it necessary to make Churchill the butt of jokes -- referencing his cigar smoking and other eccentricities. Stalin responded with appreciation, and the President's relationship with the man he himself began to call ""Uncle Joe"" was off to a positive start.

A defense official said the soldier was arrested over allegedly pledging support to ISIS

Washington (CNN) An FBI spokesman on Monday confirmed that a SWAT team arrested a soldier in Hawaii over the weekend and charged him with supporting ISIS.

FBI Honolulu spokesman Arnold Laanui confirmed the agents arrested Ikaika Erik Kang, a 34-year-old Army soldier stationed at Schofield Barracks on Saturday.

In a release, the FBI said it had worked closely with the Army in this case. The statement said the investigation by the FBI and the Army had been going on for more than a year.

The FBI said it believed he was a ""lone actor"" and that Kang was arrested for ""providing material support"" to ISIS.

Kang is an active duty Army air traffic control operator assigned to the 25th Infantry Division at Wheeler Army Airfield in Hawaii. Kang's service records showed he was deployed to Afghanistan from July 2013 to April 2014 and served in Iraq from March 2010 to February 2011. He has received a range of medals in the course of his service, including the Army Commendation Medal.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/11/world/sutter-mass-extinction-ceballos-study/index.html,SIXTH MASS EXTINCTION: THE ERA OF 'BIOLOGICAL ANNIHILATION',"John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN who focuses on climate change and social justice. Follow him on Snapchat, Twitter and Facebook or subscribe to his email newsletter.

(CNN) Many scientists say it's abundantly clear that Earth is entering its sixth mass-extinction event, meaning three-quarters of all species could disappear in the coming centuries.

That's terrifying, especially since humans are contributing to this shift.

But that's not even the full picture of the ""biological annihilation"" people are inflicting on the natural world, according to a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Gerardo Ceballos, an ecology professor at the Universidad Nacional AutÃÂ³noma de MÃÂ©xico, and his co-authors, including well-known Stanford University biologist Paul Ehrlich, cite striking new evidence that populations of species we thought were common are suffering in unseen ways.

""What is at stake is really the state of humanity,"" Ceballos told CNN.

Their key findings: Nearly one-third of the 27,600 land-based mammal, bird, amphibian and reptile species studied are shrinking in terms of their numbers and territorial range. The researchers called that an ""extremely high degree of population decay.""

The scientists also looked at a well-studied group of 177 mammal species and found that all of them had lost at least 30% of their territory between 1900 and 2015; more than 40% of those species ""experienced severe population declines,"" meaning they lost at least 80% of their geographic range during that time.

Looking at the extinction crisis not only in terms of species that are on the brink but also those whose populations and ranges are shrinking helps show that ""Earth's sixth mass extinction is more severe"" than previously thought, the authors write. They say a major extinction event is ""ongoing.""

""It's the most comprehensive study of this sort to date that I'm aware of,"" said Anthony Barnosky, executive director of the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve at Stanford University, who was not involved in the study. Its value, Barnosky said, is that it makes visible a phenomenon typically unseen by scientists and the public: that even populations of relatively common species are crashing.

""We've got this stuff going on that we can't really see because we're not constantly counting numbers of individuals,"" he said. ""But when you realize that we've wiped out 50% of the Earth's wildlife in the last 40 years, it doesn't take complicated math to figure out that, if we keep cutting by half every 40 years, pretty soon there's going to be nothing left.""

Stuart Pimm, chair of conservation ecology at Duke University in North Carolina, summed up the the concept this way: ""When I look out over the woods that constitute my view from my window here, I know we no longer have wolves or panthers or black bears wandering around. We have eliminated a lot of species from a lot of areas. So we no longer have a functional set of species across large parts of the planet.""

This is an important point to emphasize, Pimm said. But the new paper's analysis risks overstating the degree to which extinction events already are occurring, he said, and the research methodology does not have the level of granularity needed to be particularly useful for conservationists.

""What good mapping does is to tell you where you need to act,"" Pimm said. ""The value of the Ceballos paper is a sense of the problem. But given there's a problem, what the bloody hell are we going to do about it?""

Often, scientists who study crisis in the natural world focus on species that are at high and short-term risk for extinction. These plants and animals tend to be odd and unfamiliar, often restricted to one island or forest. You probably didn't notice, for example, that the Catarina pupfish, native to Mexico, went extinct in 2014, according to the paper. Or that a bat called the Christmas Island pipistrelle is thought to have vanished in 2009.

Meanwhile, as this research shows, entire populations of other plants and animals are crashing, even if they're not yet on the brink of extinction. Some of these are well-known.

Consider the African elephant. ""On the one hand, you can say, 'All right, we still have around 400,000 elephants in Africa, and that seems like a really big number,' "" Barnosky said. ""But then, if you step back, that's cut by more than half of what their populations were in the early part of last century. There were well over 1 million elephants (then).

""And if you look at what's happened in the last decade, we have been culling their numbers so fast that if we kept up with that pace, there would be no more wild elephants in Africa in 20 years.""

Twenty years. No more African elephants. Think about that.

Barn swallows and jaguars are two other examples, according to Ceballos, the lead author of the paper. Both are somewhat common in terms of their total numbers, he said, but their decline is troubling in some places.

Such population crashes can, of course, lead to inevitable extinctions. And currently, scientists say that species are going extinct at roughly 100 times what would be considered normal -- perhaps considerably more.

There has been some dispute lately about whether the Earth's sixth mass extinction event already has begun or is simply on the horizon, but there is little disagreement among scientists that humans are driving an unprecedented ecological crisis.

All of this is contributing to a rapid decline in wild creatures, both on land and in the ocean.

Ceballos' paper highlights the urgency of this crisis -- and the need for change.

""The good news is, we still have time,"" he said. ""These results show it is time to act. The window of opportunity is small, but we can still do something to save species and populations.""

Otherwise, ""biological annihilation"" continues."

Open interest in September long-bond futures has dropped by around $3.7 million since June 28 in dollar-value per basis point move, or DV01, terms, a sign bulls are starting to liquidate positions in the sector. Speculators in recent weeks were the most bullish on 30-year Treasury futures on a net basis this year, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.The recent selloff is a sign of more pain to come for Treasury bulls, according to DoubleLine Capital Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Gundlach, whose firm oversees $109 billion and said a year ago that yields had hit bottom. With a Federal Reserve seemingly committed to raising interest rates a third time this year and speculation the European Central Bank could announce a tapering of bond purchases by the end of the year, the fundamentals arent encouraging. As yields are now approaching key technical marks that could trigger a fresh flush out of long-end bulls, the risk is building that Treasury yields go even higher.Ten-year Treasury yields are on course to move toward 3 percent this year, Gundlach said in an emailed response to questions. There has been no justification for the divergent policies in the U.S. versus Europe given economic fundamentals, he said - a point he has made previously. A 10-year yield at 3 percent would put Treasuries in definitive bear market territory, Gundlach added. The yield traded as high as 2.39 percent Thursday, just ahead of a key retracement level at 2.42 percent, coinciding with the May high.Thirty-year yields now sit just five basis points shy of their 100-day moving average, and a breach could prompt a renewed wave of selling. Curve positioning may also fuel liquidation in the long end as traders start to unwind overcrowded flattener trades. The spread between five- and 30-year yields is hovering near 95 basis points, near the narrowest since 2007.People this year had been buying long-dated Treasuries and other sovereigns as the hedge to their equity portfolios and thats why this unwind is so ugly, said Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Brean Capital LLC. They are losing money on both the equity and debt side now, and are bailing out of their long-dated Treasuries.Thursdays rout began in Europe after the results of a French debt auction showed a drop in excess demand for 30-year securities. Trading volumes in bund futures contracts jumped after the auction results were announced, sparking a surge in yields. The move gathered momentum as the yield rose above 0.51 percent, which Citigroup highlighted as strong support.Technically the dam broke in German 10-year bunds and the cascade quickly flooded sell orders into 10-year futures, with the biggest emergency overnight volume in months, Jim Vogel, a strategist at FTN Financial Capital Markets, said in a Thursday note to clients."

http://cnn.com/2017/07/03/architecture/saving-beiruts-crumbling-heritage-ime/index.html,SAVING BEIRUT'S CRUMBLING HERITAGE ARCHITECTURE,"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) ""If five people walk across here at once, the floor sways,"" architect Nehmat Alameh tells CNN, as she moves across the upper level of the crumbling, three-story 1870s mansion, typical of Beirut's Ottoman period.

Beit Kassar was once the opulent, 750 square meter-home of the Tarazi family, who made their money in the antiquities trade and postcard industry.

But in recent years, glass has been absent from its arch-topped windows and some of the exquisitely illustrated ceilings have crumbled.

Luckily, a badly needed two-year restoration program, on which Alameh is lead architect, is underway. It will include repairing shrapnel holes left from Beirut's civil war years between 1975 and 1990, installing electricity, and reinforcing that swaying floor.

Beit Kassar is one of the lucky ones.

Across the Lebanese capital beautiful heritage buildings are falling down, or -- worse -- being demolished as modern skyscrapers sweep the city.

""The Paris of the Middle East""

Beirut is one of the most densely populated cities in the world.

Although no proper census has been conducted in Lebanon since 1932, the United Nations puts Beirut's population at 470,000 , not including the suburbs. In a city that covers just 85 square kilometers (33 square miles), space is tight.

The result is an incredibly intense architectural mix. Gleaming towers pop up in the backyards of treasures from the Ottoman Empire and the French Mandate for Lebanon, which lasted from 1923 until the mid-1940s.

""There are decades of architectural history in Beirut,"" Nehmat says. In the early 20th century, it was often referred to as the ""Paris of the Middle East"".

Weygand Avenue in Beirut, Lebanon, in January 12, 1947. The city was once called the ""Paris of the Middle East"".

While there are no up-to-date statistics on the number of heritage properties left in Beirut, in 1997 a study commissioned by the Directorate-General of Urban Planning put the figure at 572 -- although the study was never finished.

Mona Hallak, an architect and prominent Lebanese heritage activist, tells CNN that she believes at least 150 of those buildings have since been lost.

In March, for example, demolition work began on the 1930s Grande Brasserie du Levant, one of the oldest breweries in the Middle East, to make way for Mar Mikhael Village, a luxury loft apartment complex. A month later, a large gap was left on Gemmayzeh's Gouraud Street after an Art Deco building there was demolished.

""Compared to even just after (the Lebanese Civil War), there has been a massacre of buildings in Beirut,"" says Joana Hammour, from the non-governmental organization Save Beirut Heritage, which lobbies to prevent the destruction of the city's old buildings.

Damage from the war

One of the most famous heritage buildings in Beirut is the Barakat Building. Also known as the ""Yellow House"", it was designed by Lebanese architect Youssef Aftimus and built in 1924 in the Ottoman revivalist style.

Located on what became the frontline of the civil war, however, it was badly hurt during the conflict and left scarred by bullet holes.

In 2012, an $18 million renovation began -- a joint venture between the Beirut authorities and the City of Paris. The building was renamed Beit Beirut and transformed into a museum and urban cultural center.

Bullet holes were deliberately left in its facade, a nod to the building's turbulent history.

However, the project is not without controversy: because a management committee has not been appointed, it is still not freely open to the public, currently accessible only during private receptions and visits.

Officials hope it will open to the public fully in September 2017.

Official problems

In its government-backed restoration, Beit Beirut is something of a rarity.

Beirut facts Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, has a population of 2.23 million.

One of the world's oldest settlements, Beirut has been inhabited for more than 5,000 years.

Beirut's population is divided pretty evenly between Muslims and Christians.

Joseph Haddad, secretary-general of the Association for the Protection of Lebanese Heritage, tells CNN that traditional buildings are most often preserved ""when their owners simply decided to keep and restore them ... not to demolish them and build a high-rise for quick short-term personal profit.""

demolition. In March, the heritage restoration movement was dealt a severe blow from the authorities when Lebanon's new Culture Minister, Ghattas Khoury, removed the renowned 18th-century ""Red House"" in the Hamra district from Beirut's list of ""untouchable"" protected heritage structures, leaving it vulnerable todemolition.

""This is the first time that a culture minister has removed a building from the heritage protection list,"" Hallak tells CNN.

""This is one of only two red-roofed buildings left in Hamram,"" Hammour adds. ""Louis Armstrong spent the night there, and it is socially and historically important.""

Save Beirut Heritage is working with another local NGO to bring a legal challenge against Khoury's decision.

Private actors perform vital role

In this environment, private actors seeking homes with a history have become increasingly important.

Luckily, they are in no short supply.

Work on the Tarazi mansion, for example, is led by AKK architecture firm, whose founder Annabel Karim Kassar will live in the finished property. A team of experts from Germany has been enlisted to incorporate original architectural details into the restoration, partly due to a skills shortage in Beirut in heritage conservation. One curator-restorer has been employed specifically to work on the painted ceilings, easily the highlight of the house.

The original Ottoman ceiling has been preserved on the top floor of Beit Kassar.

Across town, Zeina and Sammy -- who asked CNN not to print their full names -- seven years ago bought a 1940s house in the discreet eastern Beirut district of Qobayat. The building came complete with holes made by bombs that had fallen onto the roof.

This March, Zeina opened three of its exquisitely-restored rooms as a guesthouse, called Zanzoun.

Guest bedrooms are furnished with mother-of-pearl wardrobes from Syria and gold bedsteads from Egypt. Downstairs, a mustard yellow sofa from Beirut's Basta district, famous for its antique merchants, sits next to an enormous Russian canvas.

The couple have seen the precarious status of heritage buildings close-up: a similar house next door was torn down.

Public service

Other private parties are restoring buildings to fulfill the desperate need for public space in Beirut -- the result of years of privatization of land in a small territory with a swelling population. Since 2011, Beirut has become home to 280,000 Syrian refugees

""Mansion"" is a modern interpretation of a 1930s villa in the historic Zokak el-Blat district.

Abandoned since 1987, it was brought back to life in 2012 by two artists who persuaded the owner to open it as a creative space for artists and the public. It now hosts a library and reading room, as well as debates, exhibitions and poetry readings.

A sign indicating ""A street with traditional character"" is seen in a Beirut neighbourhood.

Rachel Dedman, a curator, is one of eight creatives who rent studios in the building.

""Lebanon is a place without any public funding for the arts, which means all institutions and individuals are stuck in application cycles for external funding from national or regional bodies, or international funders,"" she tells CNN.

""What Mansion does is exist outside such a structure: the gift of the house frees up the possibility of finding new ways of working and being.""

The future

Recent years have seen momentum gather behind the heritage preservation movement in Beirut, but activists feel more must be done.

Hallak would like to see the government pass legislation to protect buildings in certain districts with a high density of heritage sites.

""You could sacrifice a 'high rise' area where towers are already mushrooming to protect another heritage area,"" she explains.

An old Lebanese house stands among modern buildings and a construction site on Beirut's Corniche on October 7, 2015.

She also advocates for tax incentives for property owners who restore and maintain their heritage buildings, and the creation of a council to distribute donations from Lebanese expats keen to save their country's traditional architecture.

Back at the Red House, Save Beirut Heritage hopes that the building reopens as a rare public space in Hamra's crowded, highly privatized streets.

""We want to find investors for the property -- that could be the municipality,"" Hamour tells CNN.

""As there is no public space in Hamra, they could use the Red House as a library, for example. It would be perfect for that."""

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-cyber-idUSKBN19U0P4,TRUMP BACKTRACKS ON CYBER UNIT WITH RUSSIA AFTER HARSH CRITICISM,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday backtracked on his push for a cyber security unit with Russia, tweeting that he did not think it could happen, hours after his proposal was harshly criticized by Republicans who said Moscow could not be trusted. Trump said on Twitter early on Sunday that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed on Friday forming ""an impenetrable Cyber Security unit"" to address issues like the risk of cyber meddling in elections. The idea appeared to be a political non-starter. It was immediately scorned by several of Trump's fellow Republicans, who questioned why the United States would work with Russia after Moscow's alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. ""It's not the dumbest idea I have ever heard but it's pretty close,"" Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" program.  Ash Carter, who was U.S. defense secretary until the end of former Democratic President Barack Obama's administration in January, told CNN flatly: ""This is like the guy who robbed your house proposing a working group on burglary."" Trump's advisers, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, had recently sought to explain Trump's cyber push. Mnuchin said on Saturday that Trump and Putin had agreed to create ""a cyber unit to make sure that there was absolutely no interference whatsoever, that they would work on cyber security together."" But Trump returned to Twitter on Sunday to play down the idea, which arose at his talks with Putin at a summit of the Group of 20 nations in Hamburg, Germany.  ""The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit doesn't mean I think it can happen. It can't,""  Trump said on Twitter.  He then noted that an agreement with Russia for a ceasefire in Syria ""can & did"" happen. Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona acknowledged Trump's desire to move forward with Russia, but added: ""There has to be a price to pay."" ""There has been no penalty,"" McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" program according to a CBS transcript. ""Vladimir Putin ... got away with literally trying to change the outcome ... of our election."" Trump argued for a rapprochement with Moscow in his campaign but has been unable to deliver because his administration has been dogged by investigations into the allegations of Russian interference in the election and ties with his campaign. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the matter, including whether there may have been any collusion on the part of Trump campaign officials, as are congressional committees including both the House of Representatives and Senate intelligence panels. Those probes are focused almost exclusively on Moscows actions, lawmakers and intelligence officials say, and no evidence has surfaced publicly implicating other countries despite Trump's suggestion that others could have been involved. Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump says his campaign did not collude with Russia. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" program that Russia could not be a credible partner in a cyber security unit. ""If thats our best election defense, we might as well just mail our ballot boxes to Moscow,"" Schiff added. Separately, U.S. government officials said a recent hack into business systems of U.S. nuclear power and other energy companies was carried out by Russian government hackers, the Washington Post reported on Saturday. Trump said he ""strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election. He vehemently denied it."" He added: ""We negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives. Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!"" In Trump's first attempt at ending the six-year Syrian civil war, the United States, Russia and Jordan on Friday reached a ceasefire and ""de-escalation agreement"" for southwestern Syria. The ceasefire was holding hours after it took effect on Sunday, a monitor and two rebel officials said.     Any joint U.S.-Russia cyber initiative would have been a different matter. Depending how much it veered into military or espionage operations, it could have faced major legal hurdles. Language in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act prohibits the Pentagon, which includes the National Security Agency and the U.S. military's Cyber Command, from using any funds for bilateral military cooperation with Russia. Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, also noted restrictions on sharing information with Russia that would clearly prohibit offering Moscow a sense of U.S. cyber capabilities. Russia would be similarly adverse to revealing its capabilities to the United States, he noted. ""It just will not happen,"" McFaul told Reuters.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-markets-missiles-idUSKBN19V02G?il=0,TRUMP STUMPS SOUTH KOREAN MARKETS MORE THAN ANY MISSILE TESTS,"SEOUL (Reuters) - For years, investors in South Korea have become accustomed to belligerence and regular missile tests from the country's hostile northern neighbor, but now there's a new factor in their regional risk assessments - U.S. President Donald Trump. Jolts to financial markets from North Korea's military provocations are frequent but were until recently contained by an implicit expectation that global diplomatic efforts could limit Pyongyang's aggression. Now, however, there is as much market anxiety about Trump's unrestrained Tweets and a hawkish White House response as there is about North Korean agitations. Since Trump's election in November, price reactions to North Korean long-range missile tests in credit and currency derivatives, typically used by traders to hedge geopolitical risk, have been distinctly sharper. ""Trump has moved markets and China more within months than (Barack) Obama in eight years,"" said Cliff Tan, East Asian head of global markets research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.     The reclusive North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests and a series of missile launches in defiance of U.N. resolutions for decades as it is still at war with South Korea after the 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. Before Trump's election, missile tests came with such regularity that markets learned to shrug them off. This year, the options market shows the cost of insuring investments against North Korean-related risks has surged, with 3-month protection against a drop in the won, for example, reaching a high of 231 basis points in mid-April, double the levels six months earlier. This spike came as the U.S. diverted a warship towards the Korean Peninsula and showed off its strike capability in Syria, which it conducted just as Trump met with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. The cost of owning the option to sell the won in April was the highest it had been since August 2015, when the two Koreas were in a tense military standoff. ""It's the Trump-on-stage reaction,"" a currency trader in Seoul said. ""Trump's hard line approach, and his past crazy comments on everything from the Mexico-wall to Syria policies have created a whole new range of uncertainties for traders investing here."" Despite heightened geopolitical tensions, South Korea's main asset markets have performed well this year with the won KRW=KFTC and Kospi stock benchmark .KS11 up 4.6 percent and 17.4 percent, respectively, on robust exports and an upbeat outlook on second quarter corporate earnings. The cost of hedging, however, is where investors have felt the pain: options to sell Korean won for dollars were perversely more expensive after Trump's November presidential victory than when North Korea conducted its fifth nuclear test two months earlier. The premium on three-month options to sell the won had hovered around 100 basis points for years before Trump took office, and barely budged even when then U.S. President Obama issued a stern warning to Pyongyang following a missile test in April 2016. ""Financial markets have become more sensitive to the U.S. stance with more hard line policies under Trump, compared to when the Democrats were in power,"" Shim Hyun-soo, a senior fund manager with the quantitative management team of Kyobo AXA Investment Managers, said. In other derivatives markets, the spread on South Korea's 5-year credit default swap KRGV5YUSAC=MG--the contracts that offer investors protection against default on debt--reached a 10-month high of 60 basis points on April 17. Market pricing of expected volatility in the won KRWVOL has also been on the rise, with the one-month implied volatility hitting 13.2 percent in April, the highest in five years.     ""During the Obama administration, the markets didn't care much about the North. Everyone knew the Kim Jong Un regime wouldnt do anything stupid for real as it could really be the beginning of the end,"" said Jeon Seung-ji, a Seoul-based currency analyst at Samsung Futures. ""North Korean risks are no longer a 'half-day-slip', mainly because markets are not sure how Washington would handle them,"" Jeon said.

While the Spanish bank is still waiting for regulators to sign off on the transaction, first proposed in 2015, passing the Feds stress test makes that approval more likely.Banco Santander, which already owns 59 percent of the auto-loan provider, has been trying for two years to purchase a 9.7 percent stake from co-founder Thomas G. Dundon. Shares in Dallas-based Santander Consumer USA have lost almost half of their value since the bank took it public in 2014, at a time when surging car sales and a search for yield fueled a boom in auto loans. Last year, the business restated profit figures after regulators questioned its provisions for loan losses.At current prices, a 9.7 percent stake would be worth about $450 million. In 2015, when Banco Santander announced its intention to purchase Dundons holding, it gave a price tag of $928 million. Its not clear what the bank would pay if the transaction goes ahead now.A Madrid-based press officer for Banco Santander declined to comment.Santander Consumer USA rose as much as 2.3 percent and traded 0.7 percent higher at $13.19 at 10:06 a.m. in New York. Banco Santander rose 0.6 percent in Madrid, reversing earlier losses of as much as 1.2 percent. Santander Consumer is the largest issuer of bonds backed by subprime auto loans, having sold over $50 billion of the securities since 2007, according to recent slide presentations from the company. While the market for the debt is much smaller than the subprime-mortgage market that triggered the Great Recession, regulators have grown concerned that lenders are taking advantage of borrowers and putting them in cars that they cant afford.Banco Santander entered the consumer finance business in the U.S. in 2006 when it bought Drive Financial Services LP, where Dundon was president and chief operating officer. He retained 10 percent stake of the new company and remained as CEO. In 2014, the Spanish bank sold stock in the consumer business in a $1.8 billion initial public offering."
http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/unesco-2017-world-heritage-sites/index.html,2017: UNESCO'S NEWEST WORLD HERITAGE SITES - CNN.COM,"Karla Cripps, CNN Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Updated 10th July 2017

(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Made it your mission to visit every single UNESCO World Heritage Site on the planet?

That challenge is about to get tougher.

UNESCO's huge list of World Heritage properties has grown even longer this month, with the global body voting to add 21 sites during the 41st annual World Heritage Committee session in Krakow, Poland.

That brings the total of UNESCO World Heritage Sites to 1,073.

Northwest England's mountainous Lake District was among the new sites added to the list, the UK's first national park to become a World Heritage property.

""The combined work of nature and human activity has produced a harmonious landscape in which the mountains are mirrored in the lakes,"" says UNESCO's statement announcing the inscription.

India's walled city of Ahmedabad, founded by Sultan Ahmed Shah in the 15th century, was also added to the list, becoming the country's first city to get a UNESCO nod.

Located on the eastern bank of the Sabarmati river, it ""presents a rich architectural heritage from the sultanate period, notably the Bhadra citadel, the walls and gates of the Fort city and numerous mosques and tombs as well as important Hindu and Jain temples of later periods,"" says UNESCO's description of the city.

Now on the list: The English Lake District.

Two South America properties were added to the list, including Brazil's Valongo Wharf, an archeological site.

Located in central Rio de Janeiro, the wharf encompasses the entire Jornal do ComÃÂ©rcio Square and was built to receive enslaved Africans who began landing the South American continent from 1811.

""It is the most important physical trace of the arrival of African slaves on the American continent,"" says UNESCO.

UNESCO decisions draw protests

Controversial: The Cave of the Patriarchs, also known as the Ibrahimi Mosque.

This year's committee meeting wasn't without controversy. Israel has denounced UNESCO's decision to inscribe the old city of Hebron in the West Bank as a Palestinian World Heritage Site.

Israel accused UNESCO of making a politically motivated move, part of what it says is an attempt to deny the Jewish character and heritage of certain key sites in the Holy Land.

Meanwhile, UNESCO's decision to approve China's nomination of Hoh Xil, part of the high-altitude Tibetan plateau in Qinghai Province, has also drawn protests.

The International Campaign for Tibet says the nomination poses a threat to Tibetan nomads and their way of life.

""The Committee ignored the reality that Tibetans -- and nomads in particular -- are stewards of the landscape whose role is essential to sustaining the wildlife, the long-term health of the ecosystems, and the water resources that China and Asia depend upon,"" said Kai Mueller, Executive Director of the International Campaign for Tibet, in a statement.

Here's this year's list of newly inscribed sites, several of which can be viewed in the above gallery:

Turkey: Aphrodisias, archeological site and marble quarries

Eritrea: Asmara, modernist city of Africa

Russia: Assumption Cathedral and Monastery of Sviyazhsk

Germany: Caves and ice age art in the Swabian Jura

Palestinian territories: Hebron/Al-Khalil Old Town

Iran: Historic city of Yazd

Denmark: Kujataa Greenland, sub-arctic farming landscape

China: Kulangsu, historic international settlement

Angola: Mbanza Kongo, political and spiritual capital of the Kingdom of Kongo

Japan: Sacred Island of Okinoshima

France: TaputapuÃÂtea, center of the ""Polynesian Triangle""

Poland: Tarnowskie GÃÂ³ry, lead-silver-zinc mine

Cambodia: Sambor Prei Kuk temple zone

United Kingdom: English Lake District

Brazil: Valongo Wharf, archeological site

Croatia, Italy, Montenegro: Venetian Works of Defense

South Africa: Khomani Cultural Landscape

Mongolia, Russia: Landscapes of Dauria

Argentina: Los Alerces National Park

China: Qinghai Hoh Xil, world's highest and largest plateau

India: Historic city of Ahmedabad























1 / 12 12 incredible UNESCO sites you've probably never heard of: Surrounded by forests of beech, fir and spruce, a multi-level system of 16 lakes spills into waterfalls and pools in Croatia's Plitvice Lakes National Park. The lakes are known for their distinctive colors, which can be turquoise, green, blue or gray. No swimming is allowed in the pristine pools.

Places of 'outstanding universal value'

The United Nations' World Heritage Committee, made up of representatives from 21 countries, meets annually to vote natural, cultural and sites of mixed significance around the world to its prestigious preservation list, which includes places of ""outstanding universal value.""

The inscribed sites must meet at least one of 10 criteria such as ""representing a masterpiece of human creative genius,"" containing ""exceptional natural beauty"" or being an outstanding example of a traditional human settlement.

UNESCO has been adding sites to the World Heritage List since 1978.

In the travel world, being able to add the words ""UNESCO World Heritage Site"" to destination marketing materials is the equivalent of striking tourism gold, bringing fame and cultural cachet as well as resources for sites in need of restoration and protection.

As a result, nations often spend years developing pitches for inclusion on the list and must convince the UNESCO committee they will protect their sites and support them financially."

http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/10/media/fox-and-friends-donald-trump-tweet-james-comey/index.html?section=money_topstories,ANATOMY OF ANTI-COMEY TALKING POINT: THE TRUMP-FOX FEEDBACK LOOP IN ACTION,"The talking point, once again, filtered its way through Fox News before landing on President Donald Trump's desk.

In what has become a familiar pattern, Trump tweeted something on Monday that was clearly influenced by his preferred morning television program, ""Fox & Friends.""

""James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media,"" Trump tweeted at 6:40 A.M. ET. ""That is so illegal!""

But the claim -- and the on-air report on which it was based -- was false.

Eight minutes before Trump's tweet, ""Fox & Friends"" tweeted this from its official account:

Report accuses material James Comey leaked to a friend contained top secret information pic.twitter.com/Hkg4cAb6o9 Ã¢ÂÂ FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) July 10, 2017

The tweet contained a clip from that morning's broadcast of the show. In the clip, an anchor explained that ""a brand new bombshell report"" suggests former FBI Director James Comey ""may have actually broken the rules"" and put ""our national security at risk"" when he shared with a friend a memo he'd written detailing one of his conversations with Trump.

The tweet itself, which was also shared by Trump, said the report ""accuses"" Comey of leaking ""top secret information"" to a friend.

But on-air and on Twitter, ""Fox & Friends"" had mischaracterized the report it cited, which was published Sunday night by The Hill.

The report, citing ""officials familiar with the documents,"" indicated that more than half of the seven memos Comey wrote to memorialize his conversations with the president were determined ""to contain classified information.""

""Four of the memos had markings making clear they contained information classified at the 'secret' or 'confidential' level, according to officials directly familiar with the matter,"" the report said.

The Hill's article does not say, as ""Fox & Friends"" suggested, that the particular memo Comey shared with a friend with the intent of having it reported on in the news media contained ""top secret information.""

A Fox News spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

As the Washington Post's Philip Bump pointed out, Comey testified last month that the particular memo eventually reported on by the New York Times -- which memorialized a February conversation Comey had with Trump regarding the FBI's investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn -- was unclassified.

Columbia Law School Professor Daniel Richman, Comey's friend who received the memo and shared it with the Times, told CNN that the document ""was not classified at the time and to my knowledge is not classified now.""

""Jim Comey never gave me a memo that was classified; and the memo whose substance I passed on the Times has never to my knowledge been classified,"" Richman said. ""Memos that went to Congress, and not me, may well have been classified. The Director of the FBI does indeed write classified memos.""

Even The Hill's own report quotes from Comey's testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, during which he recalled preparing ""an unclassified memo of the conversation about Flynn and discussed the matter with FBI senior leadership.""

But while Trump's cable news obsession might make it easier to identify the source of misleading reports he shares, fact-checking will likely do nothing to stop his supporters on social media from repeating the falsehood.

Later on Monday morning, senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway hyped the report as she made the morning television rounds.

The feedback loop was complete shortly after 8 a.m., when Fox News reported that Trump had ""accused former FBI Director James Comey of having illegally leaked classified material.""

The BSI agency said officials investigating the new scam had secured a list of 5,000 potential targets, and were notifying those individuals.  Organized criminals were using information they gleaned from social media networks, public company websites, job sites and even calls to the companies to fake the contact information for chief executives and other top executives. BSI said the Federal Criminal Police Office estimated that the scam had already cost firms millions of euros in recent months. The scam targets personnel in the accounting and auditing departments of a company who were authorized to transfer funds, often using time pressure and warnings about an alleged ""secret project"" to manipulate them to carry out the bogus orders. BSI President Arne Schoenbohm urged companies who had fallen prey to the scam to cancel the transactions and notify police. He also urged companies to warn all those authorized to carry out financial transactions about the scam. BSI did not identify affected companies.

It grabs headlines when it happens -- like this week in Georgia, where a mom is accused of stabbing four of her children to death . The reality is, filicides happen with depressing regularity in the US. And mothers are almost as likely to be the killers as fathers.

But more than 13% of the victims were adults, specifically people in ages running from 18 to 40 years old. So the threat of filicide doesn't go away when people get old enough to move out on their own.

More than 40% of the killers in these crimes were mothers, with fathers making up about 57% of those who killed their own offspring.

once every three days. Cheryl Meyer, co-author of several books on the subject, said it's probable that a mother kills a child somewhere in the US

Only 10% of the victims were killed by their stepparents. That means 90% of the victims were the biological sons or daughters of the killer. And sons (52%) were more likely to be killed than daughters (38%).

Parents used what the study called ""personal weapons"" to beat, choke or drown victims in the majority of cases involving underage kids.

victims in the majority of cases involving kids. If the victims were adults, parents used guns in 72% of such killings.

There are several reasons why

Dr. Timothy Mariano, the study's lead author, offered up three theories: the parents are often mentally ill, they usually have higher levels of testosterone and the offspring that they kill may be considered unwanted.

Forensic psychiatrist Phillip J. Resnick, pioneer in the study of filicide research, identified five major reasons

Altruism: The parent kills the child because he or she may perceive it to be in the child's best interest. It may be reality-based (e.g., the child suffers from a terminal illness) or precede the suicide of the parent, as the parent feels it would be unfair to leave the child behind to face the cruel world.

Acute psychosis: The parent kills the child based on ideas that are inconsistent with reality. For example, the parent believes the child has been possessed by the devil.

Unwanted child: The parent kills the child that he or she regards as a hindrance.

Accidental: The child's death is an unintentional outcome of parental physical abuse."

http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/05/health/alzheimers-sleep-dementia-study/index.html,CAN POOR SLEEP LEAD TO ALZHEIMER'S?,"(CNN) One in three Americans doesn't get enough sleep, and 45% of the world's population doesn't, either. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls that a ""public health problem,"" because disrupted sleep is associated with a higher risk of conditions including diabetes, stroke and cardiovascular disease.

It may not be long before we can add Alzheimer's and other types of dementia to that list.

It's well known that people with Alzheimer's suffer sleep issues. Insomnia, nighttime wandering and daytime sleepiness are common for them, as well as other cognitive disorders such as Lewy body dementia and frontal lobe dementia.

But could poor sleep earlier in life actually cause dementia?

Sleep and dementia

A growing body of research in both mice and humans shows that disturbed sleep leads to higher levels of soluble beta amyloid, the protein that folds and forms the sticky plaques that kill brain cells and bog down information processing. Depositing amyloid in brain tissue is the first known preclinical stage of Alzheimer's and happens well before any obvious symptoms of dementia begin.

A few studies in cognitively normal people and one in mice have shown a connection between chronic sleep disruption and the development of amyloid plaques. The research in mice was particularly interesting because it showed that mice who slept well reduced their levels of beta amyloid, effectively clearing the toxin from their brains.

new study in Neurology, the journal for the American Academy of Neurology, is adding to that research by looking at the relationship between sleep quality and levels of various proteins and inflammatory markers in the cerebrospinal fluid of 101 cognitively healthy adults with an average age of 63.

All participants had known risk factors for Alzheimer's, such as family history or evidence of the APOE gene , which is associated with a greater chance of developing the disease. Their sleep quality was rated on a standard scale that measured amount, quality and trouble sleeping, along with daytime drowsiness and naps.

""Participants in our study were willing to undergo a lumbar puncture to move research on Alzheimer's disease forward,"" said co-author Barbara Bendlin of the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. ""Analyzing this fluid allowed us to look at markers related to Alzheimer's disease such as plaques and tangles, as well as markers of inflammation and nerve cell damage.""

Tangles and cell damage

Tangles are created by damaged tau, a protein responsible for cell stability and structure. Recent research points to tau-tangle accumulation as a possible step beyond amyloid plaques in the development of actual signs of Alzheimer's disease.

By comparing the spinal fluid against self-reported sleep problems, Bendlin and her colleagues found that the subjects who had sleep issues were more likely to show evidence of tau pathology, brain cell damage and inflammation, even when other factors like depression, body mass, cardiovascular disease and sleep medications were taken into account.

""Our findings align with the idea that worse sleep may contribute to the accumulation of Alzheimer's-related proteins in the brain,"" Bendlin said. ""The fact that we can find these effects in people who are cognitively healthy and close to middle age suggest that these relationships appear early, perhaps providing a window of opportunity for intervention.""

That's important, Bendlin added, because delaying the onset of Alzheimer's in those at risk by a mere five years ""could reduce the number of cases we see in the next 30 years by 5.7 million and save $367 billion in health care spending.""

Sleep Medicine Center. Ju also studies the association between sleep and dementia, and she co-wrote an ""Another new finding in this study is that daytime sleepiness, and not just disrupted nighttime sleep, is associated with early changes of Alzheimer's disease,"" said Dr. Yo-El Ju, an assistant professor of neurology at Washington University'sSleep Medicine Center.Ju also studies the association between sleep and dementia, and she co-wrote an accompanying editorial for the new study.

""Overall, this study confirms the relationship between early Alzheimer's disease and sleep disturbance,"" Ju said, ""and (it) expands -- in terms of both time and symptoms -- the window in which sleep-wake problems can be assessed for and treated, with the hope of reducing the risk of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.""

One of the limitations of the study was that the sleep problems were self-reported. Bendlin and her colleagues are recruiting people at risk for Alzheimer's to be studied in a sleep lab, where objective measurements can be taken.

""If it turns out to be the case that an intervention which improves sleep also results in less amyloid being deposited in the brain, that would provide strong support for implementing interventions before people start to show cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease,"" she said.

Dr. Rudolph Tanzi, who directs the genetics and aging research unit at Massachusetts General Hospital, agreed.

""Increasing amounts of evidence indicate that getting at least seven to eight hours of sleep is essential for brain health and function,"" Tanzi said. ""In the deepest stage of sleep, the brain cleans itself out of plaque and other toxic materials that trigger Alzheimer's disease. This reduces brain inflammation and is entirely consistent with this exciting new study.""

Which problem came first?

Not everyone with sleep problems in the study had abnormalities in their spinal fluid. For example, those with obstructive sleep apnea showed no association. Bendlin stresses that much remains to be discovered about the link between sleep and dementia.

""Not everyone who experiences sleep problems should now worry about developing dementia due to Alzheimer's disease,"" she said, adding that there is not yet a clear cause and effect relationship.

""Animal studies suggest sleep affects development of brain changes, but brain changes in turn also affect sleep,"" Bendlin said. ""In terms of figuring out which comes first, brain changes or sleep problems, that will be difficult to tease apart, because the effects really do appear to be going in both directions.""

""In experimental studies, there does seems to be evidence of both chicken and egg,"" said neuroscientist Jeffrey Iliff of Oregon Health and Sciences University. ""You can drive it either direction. So there may be a bio-directional interaction.""

That's good news if true, he said, because it means we have may have some control over whether we develop dementia.

""No, the public can't remove amyloid plaque,"" Iliff said. ""But if sleep disruption is promoting this process, then improving sleep is half of the solution to slowing the process of dementia as it develops over one's life.""

Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer's Association, agreed: ""This new study suggests there may be an opportunity to improve cognition and possibly reduce dementia risk through early diagnosis and effective treatment of sleep disorders."""
http://cnn.com/2017/07/05/europe/turkey-opposition-march/index.html,THOUSANDS TREK IN 'JUSTICE MARCH' FROM ANKARA TO ISTANBUL,"Kocaeli, Turkey (CNN) Hobbling around with bandages on her feet at a rest stop just 70 kilometers (about 43 miles) from Istanbul, Pakize Yucekan is one of the thousands of people participating in a ""Justice March"" organized by the main opposition party in Turkey.

The march route stretches some 450 kilometers (nearly 280 miles) from the Turkish capital of Ankara to Istanbul. And that is what has driven Yucekan to her current choice of shoes -- a pair of men's slippers. They're not fancy but they get the job done while she walks roughly 15 kilometers a day in record high temperatures.

""I tried sneakers for the first two weeks (of the march). That got too hot and so I tried sandals. Those hurt my feet. These are not very nice looking but I don't care, I'm comfortable,"" Yucekan said.

Yucekan and her husband Yalcin have been walking since day one with Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the march and head of the main opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP.

""He's the Gandhi of Turkey and this is his march for justice, only justice,"" says Yalcin Yucekan.

Despite this endorsement, Kilicdaroglu's decision to walk from Ankara to Istanbul caught many by surprise.

His calm manner and less-than-colorful personality have been a constant irritation for those who oppose Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

But after putting on a pair of sneakers and leading the march, the bureaucrat of some 30 years has shed his old-school image.

Kemal Kilicdaroglu photographed on day 20 of the march, rests in a small caravan.

""I am walking with conviction, with belief... I am going to walk every millimeter of those 450 kilometers,"" he said, speaking with CNN as the march stopped for a short break.

There is a lot of support as marchers go by. People welcome them, clapping along the route and honking horns in support as the participants walk by. Elderly women dangle dangerously from windows to wave Turkish flags in a show of solidarity.

Some from the Turkish Roma community join along the route with drums and clarinets, injecting music to the march. Old-time favorites are hummed, while others join in with a bit of dance.

Football fans from the Galatasaray football team joined in the march, adding their stadium chants and songs.

The marchers also routinely run into supporters of Erdogan who chant his name and hold up four fingers -- a symbol adopted by the President's supporters. A truck full of manure was dumped outside a motel where marchers stayed for a night. One man lunged aggressively at the marchers and screamed for them to be hanged. For their part, the marchers either ignore the insults or respond with applause.

Critics of the march accuse participants of supporting terrorists and inciting chaos in Turkey. Erdogan has said that those marching for justice should instead focus on the victims of last year's attempted coup in July during which nearly 250 people lost their lives.

Those who participate in the march could be viewed as ""willfully being a part of the crime of treason,"" Erdogan said last week in a speech.

A woman in traditional Aegean clothes participates in the Justice March.

Kilicdaroglu announced his protest march from the Turkish capital to Istanbul after a CHP parliamentarian was arrested. The lawmaker was sentenced to 25 years in jail for giving an opposition journalist video allegedly showing Turkey sending weapons into Syria.

But the march has become about more than that one arrest. Kurds and leftists have been walking with nationalists and some conservative Muslims who all have grievances against the Erdogan government.

The long days pounding the pavement through the Turkish countryside have taken their toll. One person died from a heart attack and another was hospitalized.

The police presence along the main E-5 highway heading towards Istanbul.

Sixty-nine-year-old Kilicdaroglu says he would not describe himself as athletic.

""It would be a lie to say I don't have any trouble walking this much but if you told me four months ago that I would walk 450 kilometers to Istanbul, I would have thought you had gone mad. But we are the end of the line,"" he said.

""Turkey has stopped being a democratic country. It has become beholden to one man... This we cannot accept,"" he said.

The march is expected to end with rally in Istanbul on Sunday. Whether authorities will allow the rally to take place is still unclear."

He added that this is the first public evidence of senior officials having met with Russians to try to discredit Clinton

Washington (CNN) The vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said Monday that Donald Trump Jr.'s acknowledgment of a meeting with a Russian lawyer last June is the first clear public evidence that senior Trump campaign officials met with Russians to try to discredit Hillary Clinton.

""This is the first time that the public has seen clear evidence of senior level members of the Trump campaign meeting Russians to try to obtain information that might hurt the campaign of Hillary Clinton,"" Sen. Mark Warner told reporters.

Trump Jr. acknowledged Sunday that he met with a Russian lawyer who he had been told ""might have information helpful to the campaign."" The President's oldest son issued his statement in response to The New York Times's reporting that he ""was promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton"" before agreeing to meet with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.

Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort also attended the meeting with Veselnitskaya, according to Trump Jr., but he said he told them ""nothing of the substance"" prior to the meeting. Trump Jr. said it quickly became clear during the meeting that Veselnitskaya had no information he deemed meaningful and that Veselnitskaya primarily wanted to secure the meeting to talk about a law pertaining to adoptions.

But Warner said Monday that Trump Jr.'s acknowledgment of the meeting reveals a ""continuing pattern"" of Trump campaign and administration officials having ""conveniently forgotten"" meetings they had with Russians.

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected a 10,000 job increase, with the highest prediction at 21,400, and no change in the unemployment rate.Faster employment growth adds to evidence of a broadening economic recovery. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has touted the improvement in recent weeks and signaled it may be time to raise interest rates from extraordinarily low levels.Todays jobs numbers cement the case for the central bankers to raise rates in the coming week, said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto. The jobs market is tightening, and not that far from what historically has been judged as full employment.Investors pushed bets for the central banks 0.5 percent rate to rise at the July 12 meeting even further after the job report, with trading in overnight swaps climbing to 94 percent from 86 percent on Thursday. The odds were about 5 percent a month ago, before Poloz and his deputies said that two rate cuts in 2015 have done the job reviving activity.Canadas dollar strengthened 0.7 percent to C$1.2891 versus the U.S. dollar at 11:10 a.m. in Toronto, the strongest since September. Five-year federal government bond yields rose 2 basis points to 1.46 percent.The report also showed some resolution to questions about lingering job market slack. Hours worked rose 1.4 percent from a year earlier, the fastest pace since 2015.The Labor Department in Washington said Friday that payrolls climbed by 222,000 last month, while average hourly earnings growth of 2.5 percent trailed economist forecasts even with unemployment close to the lowest since 2001.Statistics Canada said average hourly wages of permanent employees rose 1.0 percent in June from a year earlier, matching the pace for May. For all workers, wages rose 1.3 percent over that period. The pace of wage gains, a closely watched indicator of the health of the labor market, had slowed to a record low in April.The overall quality of the labor report is too good for Poloz to overlook, having already cited signals of a broadening recovery, economists said.Employment rose by about 103,000 between April and June, or by 0.6 percent, the largest quarterly gain since 2010. The biggest increase in June was 27,000 new jobs in the professional scientific and technical services category.There was also regional strength, from Quebecs unemployment rate holding at a record low of 6 percent, and Albertas rate falling to 7.4 percent from 7.8 percent.The last domino just fell for a rate increase, Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto, wrote in a research note."
http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/08/europe/g20-protests/index.html,"RALLIES, RIOTS AND RAVES: HAMBURG'S THREE DAYS OF G20 PROTESTS","Hamburg, Germany (CNN) Julia Reusing stood teary eyed under a strip of halogen lights in Hamburg's red light district as the late summer sun's lingering light turned to dusk.

Standing in front of the 27-year-old Frankfurt native on Thursday evening, were a group of anti-capitalist protesters -- frustrated after their ""Welcome to Hell"" demonstration was interrupted.

Clashes between riot police and demonstrators started shortly after the ""Welcome to Hell"" rally began on Thursday evening.

Police, who had contained the crowd with tear gas, pepper spray, and water cannons, said they were responding to violent protesters, known as the Black Bloc, who had shown up with their faces and heads completely covered.

Reusing said the police would have intervened regardless, using any small incident as a catalyst to shut the protest down.

""If this is all we can do just for showing our opinion and giving a statement -- and if the state forces are just shutting us up... I mean what kind of state do we live in,"" she said.

Hamburg Police said overall 476 officers were injured, at least 186 protesters were arrested and 225 detained over the three days. In total 20,000 police officers were deployed throughout the G20 summit (this includes additional police officers that were requested after Friday night).

Julia Reusing, 27: ""Revolution must not be full of agression. Revolution means love -- not to come together and fight.""

""Welcome to Hell"" was the first of over 30 planned demonstrations in the days before, during and after the G20 Summit. On Saturday, Hamburg Police said 213 officers were injured, at least 114 protesters were arrested and 98 detained over the three days.

When German Chancellor and G20 host Angela Merkel announced her hometown of Hamburg as the summit's location, some feared that the city and its 1.8 million residents would suffer.

The security required to welcome world leaders such as US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Tayyip Recep Erdogan would be disruptive to residents and businesses. But Merkel pressed ahead.

At the same time, demonstrators from across Germany and further afield prepared to exercise their right to assemble.

Up to 12,000 people attended the anti-G20 protest, ""Welcome to Hell.""

Authorities implemented a ""Red-Zone"" an area sectioned off to all but the G20 leaders and their convoys and administrators. At least 15,000 riot police were deployed.

Twenty-five-year-old student Merle M., who declined to give her last name and was protesting over migration rights, told CNN the ""Red Zone"" demonstrated that leaders were ""trying to delete the right to protest.""

The rally called for solidarity amongst anti-capitalist leftist groups.

On Friday morning, a coalition of protest groups organized as ""Block G20 -- Colour the Red Zone"" attempted to break through into the restricted area.

Group organizer and political scientist Alexis Passadakis, 40, told CNN that the aim of the protest was ""disturb the summit.""

Passadakis said the G20 is ""illegitimate with no basis in international law. We don't want a partnership of governance where there's a complete lack of transparency.""

""It's got no effective climate change policy, are blocking migrants saafe routes... and oh, the austerity!"" he said.

Protestors attempting to cross through the ""Red Zone"" barrier are chased by riot police on Friday.

Throughout the day, groups of around 50 people attempted to cross into the ""Red Zone"" -- many staging sit-ins that included singing, chalk-drawing and bubble blowing with other groups drumming and chanting. Local residents handed out coffee to the demonstrators.

Some of the groups who staged sit-in protests were pelted with water cannons before being removed forcibly by police.

On Friday afternoon, scores of people met at the Millerntorplatz where anti-capitalist and anti-fascist groups from Italy and France gathered among German protesters for what briefly felt like a rave.

Singing, chanting and drumming was heard throughout the march.

Eventually, it descended into a chaotic game of cat-and-mouse -- violent protesters hurled stones, bricks and bottles at riot police who responded with sound blasts and tear gas.

Thousands of anti-capitalist groups from across Europe gathered in Hamburg's Millerntorplatz before the rally turned violent.

Caught in the middle of the skirmish was 77-year-old Hamburg resident Karsten Alpers and his bed-bound wife Halgard, who he had brought outside for their daily stroll.

Amidst a crowd of protesters running from riot police, Alberts told CNN that although he wasn't informed where the protests would go, he wasn't worried about the demonstrations and wanted to go about his day as normal.

Karsten Alpers, wife Halgard and her carer Karina Stanczak were caught up in the skirmishes on Friday.

""For Hamburg, the G20 is a wonderful idea but for the real people living here, it's a hard thing -- there's traffic and it's impossible to get around. These people won't damage anything -- they are peaceful. We are not scared,"" he said.

Verena Zech, 47, who was walking her dogs during the ""Colour the Red Zone"" demonstration, said the G20 restrictions in the city had prevented her from getting to work.

15,000 riot police were initially deployed for the summit but on Friday, Hamburg Police called for an extra 1,000 to provide additional support.

Although her routine was disrupted, Zech said she didn't mind the demonstrations themselves, but called on the German government to give more information about the cost of hosting the summit.

The insurance worker added that her neighbors had experienced ""angst"" over violent clashes that were broadcast on television from Thursday night's protests and from Friday morning, where masked protesters had set cars on fire in an upscale neighborhood in western Hamburg.

Police used water cannons to disperse a crowd of protestors in central Hamburg on Thursday.

As dusk fell Friday, activists returned to the Reeperbahn, where protesters from the LGBTI+ community, anarchists and other members of the left enjoyed three separate music events.

Some moved barefoot through the square -- cutting through a wafting pungent smell of cannabis and cigarette smoke as Lou Reed's ""Perfect Day"" blared from a loudspeaker.

Further down the street, anarchists and members of splinter left groups bounced heads to a socialist-styled hip-hop performance.

Later, a van that had been driven from southern Germany spun electronic music from its roof; a sizeable chunk of the crowd swaying their bodies as blinking lights from water cannon trucks flashed directly in front of them.

Electronic music was the soundtrack to a late night dance party at Reeperbahn, where activists created a human peace sign in front of water cannons parked in front of the rally.

But a mile away in the Sternschanze district, riots broke out for a second night in a row.

From dusk until dawn Saturday, a group of anarchists and radical left-wing protesters set alight scaffolding, building supplies and trash cans across a four-block radius.

Anarchists started fires in the Sternschanze district on Friday.

Police responded with tear gas and water cannons as demonstrators continued to fuel multiple fires across the area with whatever scraps they could find.

As the riots grew, retail shops were looted and a supermarket was burned out.

At one point, anarchists poured stolen champagne onto a crackling fire as other demonstrators stood topless, waving their water soaked t-shirts dry over the heat.

Multiple shops were looted and destroyed.

While fires raged, leaving parts of the Sternschanze looking like a war zone, a few streets away party goers drank beer and cycled through empty streets freed of traffic.

As the G20 summit drew to a close on Saturday, an eclectic mix of up to 50,000 activists, according to police, moved through the city's sun-filled streets, shaking off Friday night's hangover with each step.

Two separate groups marched parallel to one another during the day, with a markedly different dynamic in comparison to the previous day's rallies.

The marches saw LGBTI+ groups, Marxist collectives, migration lawyers, Chinese human rights activists, Kurdish independence movements, feminist organizations and environmental activists walking peacefully alongside one another with riot police leading the way.

Kurds advocating for an independent state demonstrated at one of the rallies on Saturday.

Couples with sunflower crowns held hands and barefooted activists picnicked on the pavement.

Some families traveled into the city center on tandem bikes to listen to anti-G20 speeches at a stage by the harborside Fischmarkt -- where the first skirmishes had kicked off just days before.

Carolin Wolter, a 25-year-old office worker, arrived to the harbor with young daughter Levke as Nina Simone's anthem ""Sinnerman"" played between talks on climate change.

22,000 protestors, including many environmental activists marched through central Hamburg on Saturday. A separate demonstration also moved through the city at the same time.

Wolter said she's worried about the decisions that G20 leaders such as Trump are making about the environment, claiming their profit before people policies will inevitably lead to a bleak future.

""(The environment is) the first main important issue to speak about, especially for my daughter, whose future lies in the decision of these leaders,"" Wolter said. ""And that worries me.""

As the US President and other leaders left the summit on Saturday, police officers took off their helmets and let out a long exhale, telling CNN the atmosphere had finally relaxed.

For the protesters, concerned that they'd seen little at the G20 to assuage their concerns, their campaigns continue."
http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/11/politics/donald-trump-russia-controversies-dominate-again/index.html,DONALD TRUMP RUSSIA CONTROVERSIES DOMINATE AGAIN,"Washington (CNN) Any hope that President Donald Trump's direct talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin about Russia's interference in the 2016 election might help get him and the White House out from under the mountain of suspicion he has faced since coming into office had evaporated by Monday afternoon -- and got buried by Monday night.

The political points he might have earned were quickly knocked off the board as he and a string of top aides acquiesced to the Kremlin's claims that Trump accepted Putin's denial of election interference. (Only the president's chief of staff Reince Priebus, who was not present for the Putin meeting, refuted the Kremlin account.) By Monday night, the White House once again found itself firmly under the storm of Russia controversies after a series of New York Times reports tied Trump's eldest son to alleged Russian government attempts to influence the election.

By the time the White House's No. 2 spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders stepped up to the podium Monday, concerns over the Trump-Putin meeting were amplified by the revelation that the president's eldest son had met during the campaign with a Russian lawyer whom the younger Trump was told had dirt on Trump's Democratic rival, according to the Times.

The Times reported later Monday that the younger Trump was told in an email before the meeting that the information was derived from a Russian government effort, citing three people with knowledge of the email. A lawyer for Trump Jr. Called it ""much ado about nothing.""

The White House tried to veer away from those controversies, drawing attention to administration nominees they say Senate Democrats are blocking and presenting a rosy picture of efforts to rally Senate Republicans around health care reform legislation.

But the Russia controversies once again commanded the spotlight.

Kremlin questions pile up

Sanders -- speaking once again off-camera -- was deluged with questions that underscored the rollicking 72 hours of fallout from Trump's encounter with the Russian leader, a period marked by clashing accounts of that meeting, eyebrow-raising Trump tweets and criticism from fellow Republicans aimed squarely at Trump.

Following the treasury secretary and national security adviser's lead, Sanders declined to contradict the Kremlin's account that Trump ""accepted"" Putin's denial of election-meddling.

""The President heard Putin's denial,"" Sanders said. ""He heard his answer and he moved forward with places that they thought they could work together.""

The lack of pushback on the Kremlin's account sent a stark message from the White House: That Putin's denials are at least on par with the US intelligence community's conclusions that Putin directed a campaign to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.

And Sanders again opened the door to the ""impenetrable Cyber Security Unit"" that Trump raised and killed in the space of a day on Twitter amid widespread criticism from Republicans like Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who mocked the irony of collaborating with Russia on cybersecurity.

""Discussions may still take place,"" Sanders said, after noting the ""need to have conversations with our adversaries.""

And after a brief attempt to swat away criticism surrounding the revelation that Donald Trump, Jr. had met -- alongside Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort -- with a Russian lawyer, Sanders said she'd have nothing further to add on the matter.

That story is not likely to be short-lived. It has already prompted calls from members of Congress for further scrutiny and is likely to add to the pile of Russia-related questions that Trump's nominee for FBI Director Christopher Wray will face Wednesday when he heads to Capitol Hill for his first confirmation hearing.

The barrage of questions on Russia-related matters was nothing new to a White House that has been buried week-after-week by developments in the investigation into ties between Trump campaign associates and Russia, and scrutiny over Trump's relatively amiable posture toward Russia.

And once again, the barrage was also a sign of a missed opportunity.

""If Trump had said to Putin -- and afterwards to the public -- that interference is absolutely unacceptable, that we won't allow it and will take steps to prevent it in the future, he might have begun to get ahead of this issue. But he bungled it badly,"" said Stephen Sestanovich, a Columbia University professor who served as ambassador-at-large for the former Soviet Union in the Clinton administration.

""By showing he can't handle Putin, he may even have made his problem worse,"" said Sestanovich, also a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Trump tweets, but not seen

Trump, meanwhile, remained behind closed doors on Monday -- continuing to avoid the press after he bucked the precedent set by the last two presidents and declined to hold a news conference at the G20 summit.

He did take to Twitter -- not to reaffirm his support for the US intelligence community's assessment of Russian meddling -- but to say he and Putin discussed the Democratic National Committee's refusal to turn over its hacked server to the FBI for inspection.

The latest drop in what's become a squall of Russia-related controversies once again clouded the White House's efforts to make progress on policy fronts.

As the Senate returned from recess facing daunting odds of passing health care reform, the White House was once again mired in controversy rather than working to publicly sell the health care bill.

But even as the number of Senate Republicans opposed to the health care bill backed by the White House rose to 10 after senators returned home to face their constituents, Trump had no public events on his schedule Monday and is not expected to make a public push on health care before leaving for France later this week.

The lack of any public advocacy from the president came even as the White House's director of legislative affairs Marc Short said Monday that ""there's more we could do to educate the public.""

""It's a fair point that the Democrats were more organized in their messaging on the bill than collectively Republicans have been,"" Short said, acknowledging the current bill's abysmal approval rating.

The lackluster public engagement from the President -- who has continued to speak directly with Senate Republicans, according to White House officials -- has left many Republicans scratching their heads or questioning Trump's commitment to the legislation's passage.

Doug Heye, the former communications chief to former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, noted that Trump could ""be very influential"" in pressuring several GOP opponents of the current bill who represent states he won handily in 2016 if he headed to those states to boost the health care bill, similarly to how President Barack Obama rallied support for the Affordable Care Act before it passed.

""The only dynamic between where we are now and the past Republican struggles to pass any healthcare legislation is that we've got a Republican in the White House,"" said Heye, a CNN political commentator. ""Whether that's Donald Trump or Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio -- that should be enough. If there's a fully engaged effort, that should be enough to get it over the finish line.""

Trump has held some public events at the White House to push the health care bill, he has held no public events outside the White House aimed solely on selling the legislation and raising pressure on fellow Republicans.

While White House officials considered such rallies to push the health care bill, a White House official told CNN aides to the president moved away from that idea -- seeking to put some distance between the president and the increasingly unpopular bill."

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-rights-idUSKBN19U05T?il=0,"IN 2015, CHINA CRUSHED RIGHTS LAWYERS BUT ACTIVISTS ARE STILL ORGANIZING","BEIJING (Reuters) - This Sunday is the second anniversary of a major Chinese government crackdown that led to the detention of hundreds of rights lawyers.  But while that has taken a lot of lawyers who previously could represent people seeking redress from the Communist Party system out of circulation, it is not preventing activists from communicating, and in particular seeking to lobby foreign governments to take a stance against rights abuses in China, activists and diplomats say. On July 9, 2015, the authorities launched what rights groups say was a coordinated attempt to quash China's rights movement, in what is known as the 709 crackdown because of the date of the event. The core members of the movement were described by the official paper of the ruling Communist Party, the People's Daily, as ""a major criminal gang that has seriously damaged social order."" Two years on, most of the detained have been sentenced and are in prison or under house arrest; many made public confessions and were sentenced in what their families say were either secret or scripted trials. They werent allowed independent representation and were defended by government-appointed lawyers. Other activists and lawyers were picked up in the months before and after that date. Beijing's campaign did not spell the end of rights activism in China, according to Western diplomats, who say their embassies are meeting activists on an almost daily basis. They did, though, say that the campaign has pushed activism further outside the system, limiting avenues of redress within China's courts, and leaving international pressure as a main focus for the activists. The government has made reforms to professionalize the legal system and improve the average persons ability to settle disputes in court, but the party has rejected a separation of powers in China and few lawyers work to actively find and defend people who are alleging there have been abuses of government power, as rights lawyers do. ""They burned the field but the roots remain and new shoots are constantly appearing,"" one Western diplomat said, declining to be named. Feng Chongyi, an Australia-based expert on China's rights activists at the University of Technology Sydney, said that President Xi Jinping had aimed to ""eliminate"" the rights lawyers and other forms of organized resistance with the crackdown. Feng was himself prevented from leaving China for a week in March and was subjected to daily interrogations during that time. Those detained did get financial and moral support from other lawyers, said Feng, who is an Australian permanent resident with a Chinese passport. China has rejected international criticism of the crackdown and defends its detention and persecution of rights lawyers saying that they are criminals who pose a threat to Chinas national security and social order. The Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a fax seeking comment on the crackdown. Born three months before the founding of the People's Republic of China, Xu Xiaoshun did not choose to become an activist, but when the authorities detained his son in the summer of 2015, the then 66-year-old decided he had little choice. ""When he first got started, I said to him: 'If you really want to work defending rights, then when you are locked up, I will come save you',"" Xu told Reuters, speaking of his son, Wu Gan, an online blogger and activist.  Xu has not seen his son since he was detained in May 2015  two months before the big crackdown, Wu, who is better known by his screen-name ""Super Vulgar Butcher,"" was later charged with ""subversion of state power"". His trial date has not been announced. Xu is one of many family members, friends and colleagues of those detained in recent years who have taken up activism in response to Beijing's hardline campaign. Shortly after detaining his son, the authorities also came for Xu. ""A month after Wu Gan was locked up, I was approached by the local police and asked to write a letter saying that Wu Gan was guilty,"" Xu said. ""'He's not guilty,' I told them. 'Guilty or not you should still write it,"" they told me. When I refused they detained me, too,"" he recounts.   The authorities held Xu for 19 months on fraud charges before a court found him innocent and released him. Xu says the case against him was fabricated. Reuters was unable to independently verify Xu's claims. The Public Security Bureau did not respond to a request for comment on the matter. Since his release, Xu has spent most of his time on the road, meeting with diplomats, activists and the family members in similar cases, as well as friends of his son. He also uses encrypted messaging applications. Xi has differed from other recent Chinese leaders in making repression of rights activism much more public, according to Eva Pils, an expert on civil society in China at King's College London. The repression can scare some people but with others it can lead to radicalisation, Pils said: ""What was once seen as purely legal advocacy has become political rights advocacy, she adds.

Aside from his creative dreams, Will also comes to town with a secret mission, carrying a clandestine message for his cousin, a leader to Catholics subjected to persecution by England's Protestant government.

Meanwhile, the young playwright stumbles into an acting company in desperate and sudden need of a hit, while immediately being drawn to the proprietor's daughter (Olivia DeJonge), whose own artistic ambitions are blunted by the societal mores of the time.

Shakespeare also finds a sort-of champion in established and celebrated writer Christopher Marlowe (Jamie Campbell Bower), although there's a bit of a Mozart-Salieri aspect to their relationship, with Marlowe's admiration tied to a bout of writer's block as he wades into lustful indulgences and distractions.

http://cnn.com/2017/07/05/health/sugar-pregnancy-child-allergy-asthma-study/index.html,SUGAR DURING PREGNANCY MAY BE LINKED TO CHILD'S ALLERGIES,"(CNN) Women who consume too many sugary foods and drinks during pregnancy may be increasing their children's risk of developing an allergy or allergic asthma, according to a study published Thursday in the European Respiratory Journal.

The researchers looked at allergies that produce respiratory and skin symptoms, including dust mites, cats and grass. ""Allergic asthma"" causes breathing problems, like wheezing and coughing, in the presence of common allergens such as dust.

Researchers from Queen Mary University of London used data gathered from nearly 9,000 mother-child pairs in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, an ongoing research project that tracks the health of families with children born between April 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992.

According to the World Health Organization, 235 million people have asthma, and it's a common disease among children. That number is expected to increase to 400 million by 2025. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology reports that worldwide , sensitivity to one or more allergens among children is approaching 40% or 50%, and 10.6% of children reported respiratory allergies in the previous 12 months in 2012.

""The dramatic 'epidemic' of asthma and allergies in the West in the last 50 years is still largely unexplained -- one potential culprit is a change in diet,"" said Annabelle Bedard, lead author and a postdoctoral fellow at Queen Mary's Centre for Primary Care and Public Health Blizard Institute. ""Intake of free sugar and high fructose corn syrup has increased substantially over this period.""

Free sugars "" include those that are naturally present in honey, syrups and unsweetened fruit juices -- though not those in whole vegetables and fruits -- and those that are added to food and beverages by the manufacturer, the cook or the consumer.

""We know that the prenatal period may be crucial for determining risk of asthma and allergies in childhood and recent trials have confirmed that maternal diet in pregnancy is important,"" Bedard wrote in an email.

To investigate a potential connection between a mom's diet and a child's allergies, Bedard and her colleagues calculated the amount of free sugars consumed by the women during pregnancy based on self-reported estimates in questionnaires.

Next, the team looked at how the moms' sugar consumption compared with allergies and asthma diagnosed in the children beginning age 7.

Nearly 62% of the children did not have any allergic conditions, but the remaining children had one or more maladies or symptoms. About 22% of the kids had a common allergy, 16% had eczema, 12% had asthma, 11% had wheezing with whistling, and 9% had hay fever, the researchers found.

Then, the researchers compared the children of moms who ate the least sugar during pregnancy -- less than 34 grams, or 7 teaspoons, per day -- with the children of moms who ate the most -- between 82 and 345 grams, or 16 and 69 teaspoons, per day.

The children of women with highest sugar intake during pregnancy had a 38% higher risk of allergy diagnosis, the researchers calculated. Kids of the moms in this group had a 73% increased risk of being diagnosed with an allergy to two or more allergens. And the allergic asthma risk increased by 101% for children of moms in the high-sugar consumption group, meaning the risk of developing allergic asthma was double that of kids born to women in the low-sugar group.

Only weak evidence linked sugar consumption during pregnancy to chronic asthma, the researchers say. And there were no ties between a mother eating sweets during pregnancy and either eczema or hay fever.

Bedard and Seif Shaheen, senior researcher of the study and a professor at Queen Mary, emphasized that the research is simply observational and so does not conclude that moms who eat sugar during pregnancy cause allergies in their children.

""Similarly, we cannot rule out the possibility that the main findings arose by chance,"" Bedard said.

With such strong results, though, the team is continuing to examine the issue and trying to replicate the findings among two other groups of children, Bedard explained.

Sheena Cruickshank, senior lecturer in immunology at the University of Manchester and a representative for the British Society for Immunology, said it is unclear from the study findings how strong the effect is.

""More studies will be needed to work out if there is any causation in this relationship,"" said Cruickshank, who was not involved in the new research. ""Atopic diseases, such as allergy and asthma, are complex and associated with many genetic and environmental effects, including the microbes and pollutants we are exposed to.""

Bacteria are commonly found within the digestive tracts of all humans. When it comes to babies, Cruickshank noted that it is well-known that this bacterial content ""is influenced by how a baby is delivered, the type of milk the baby is fed as well as their diet as they grow older.""

""Future studies should look to take these variables into account so we can understand the full relationship between maternal diet during pregnancy and allergic disease in the offspring,"" Cruickshank said.

Dr. Shannon M. Clark, an associate professor at University of Texas Medical Branch-Galveston, said the large number of participants was a strength of the study. However, the researchers did not examine each mother's sugar intake until after 32 weeks of pregnancy.

""As a result, the impact of exposure early in pregnancy cannot be assessed,"" said Clark, who was not involved in the research. ""As with any study of this design, additional research would be ideal.""

Clark noted that pregnant women need to eat healthy diets to reduce risk of developing gestational diabetes, a form of diabetes that occurs in pregnancy and that is more common among overweight and obese mothers.

""Eating excessive amounts of sugar in pregnancy can put the mother at risk for developing gestational diabetes,"" she said. ""Gestational diabetes increases the risk of having a large baby, cesarean delivery and preeclampsia."" And babies born to women with gestational diabetes may have problems with breathing, low glucose levels and jaundice.

For pregnant women, Bedard said, it would be ""prudent"" to follow general nutritional guidelines cautioning against eating an abundance of sugary products -- ""whether or not we subsequently show that a high sugar intake in pregnancy causes allergy in the offspring."""
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-nato-idUSKBN19V12V,"PLEDGING REFORMS BY 2020, UKRAINE SEEKS ROUTE INTO NATO","KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine will begin discussions with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on an action plan to get it into the U.S.-led alliance, its leader said on Monday, while the country would work on reforms to meet membership standards by 2020. President Petro Poroshenko, whose country is fighting a Kremlin-backed insurgency in eastern Ukraine, revived the prospect of NATO membership during a visit by NATO Secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg who himself used the occasion to call on Moscow to withdraw its troops from Ukraine. ""Ukraine has clearly defined its political future and its future in the sphere of security,"" Poroshenko speaking to reporters alongside Stoltenberg.   ""Today we clearly stated that we would begin a discussion about a membership action plan and our proposals for such a discussion were accepted with pleasure."" Russia, deeply opposed to enlargement of NATO toward its borders, weighed in quickly, saying the prospect of NATO membership for Ukraine would not promote stability and security in Europe. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, reacting to Stoltenberg's comment repeated Russia's assertion that it had never had troops in Ukraine. NATO leaders agreed at a summit in 2008 that Ukraine would one day become a member of the alliance. But there was little popular support for the issue at the time and it was never pursued by Ukraine's pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovich. Support for NATO membership however has soared since Russia's annexation of Crimea in March 2014, following the fall of Yanukovich, and the outbreak of the war in eastern Ukraine, which has killed more than 10,000 people. Some 69 percent of Ukrainians want to join NATO, according to a June poll by the Democratic Initiatives Foundation, compared to 28 percent support in 2012 when Yanukovich was in power. Most observers say any prospect of NATO membership for Ukraine is years off. No dates were issued for when talks on a membership action plan might begin and Poroshenko himself said: ""This does not mean that we will soon be applying for membership.""  Poroshenko, in separate comments issued by his office, said Ukraine was determined to conduct reforms in order to ""have a clear schedule of what must be done by 2020 to meet the NATO membership criteria."" A NATO spokeswoman said these would relate to defense, anti-corruption measures, governance and law enforcement.  But the war in the east, which still ticks on despite a theoretical ceasefire, also poses a big obstacle to membership since NATO rules state that aspiring members must first settle international disputes by peaceful means. Stoltenberg called on Russia to withdraw thousands of troops from Ukraine - forces that Moscow has repeatedly denied sending - and raised concerns about the growing threats to the safety of international teams monitoring the conflict.  He also said NATO had provided Ukraine with new equipment to uncover the perpetrators of a cyber attack that hit Ukraine in June and spread globally.  A cyber attack that began in Ukraine on June 27 spread around the world, knocking out computers and disrupting factories and shipping. Ukrainian politicians pinned the blame on Russia, while Russia denied involvement.  Additional reporting by Robin Emmott in Brussels; writing by Matthias Williams; Editing by Richard Balmforth"
http://cnn.com/2017/07/07/opinions/americas-jobs-problem-sachs/index.html,"AMERICA, WE STILL HAVE A JOBS PROBLEM","Jeffrey Sachs is a university professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

(CNN) For those with a college degree or above, life is good. Jobs are plentiful, incomes are rising, inflation is low, health is broadly improving, and the impacts of the new information technologies -- from smartphones to e-commerce to ubiquitous information -- are generally beneficent.

For those without a college degree, the situation is starkly different. Earnings are low and often lagging behind inflation. Health conditions of less-educated whites have been deteriorating, with rising mortality from suicides, opioid addiction, and other kinds of substance abuse. It may not even pay to work, if the meager take-home pay reduces access to public benefits.

At first glance, America's job market is strong. The unemployment rate in June was just 4.4%, and non-farm payroll employment rose by 222,000. Yet while the American economy is creating jobs, it is not creating enough good jobs. Solutions will have to go far beyond raising the minimum wage.

We can get a sense of the problem by looking not at the unemployment rate but at total employment relative to the total adult population. That ratio in June stood at 60.1%, meaning close to three of every five adults is working, still down sharply from the peak rate of 64.6% in early 2000. Millions of individuals without jobs are not looking for work, and are therefore not counted as unemployed.

We can get a sense of who those individuals are by looking at educational attainment. Among individuals whose highest educational attainment is a high school diploma, the employment ratio is only 54.9%. For those with a bachelor's degree or higher, the employment ratio is 72.1%. America's jobs crisis hits lower-skilled workers, essentially those with less than a bachelor's degree.

We have become, in effect, two societies, largely divided by educational attainment.

JUST WATCHED What is the 'real' unemployment rate? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What is the 'real' unemployment rate? 03:09

As has been discussed widely in recent political debates, the loss of employment and relative earnings for less-educated workers results from two related forces: automation and globalization. Machines have increasingly replaced less-skilled jobs in agriculture, mining, and manufacturing, while the remaining labor-intensive operations (such as the cutting and stitching of garments) moved overseas. The trend is, if anything, accelerating: McDonald's has recently announced, for example, a further move to self-serve kiosks

Donald Trump won the vote of working-class voters in part by promising to bring overseas jobs back to the US, especially manufacturing jobs. This is doomed to fail.

Most job losses have been due to automation, not outsourcing. Most offshored jobs are not returning. And when production does return, it will be capital intensive, meaning that hundreds of millions of dollars of new factory investments will produce hundreds of jobs , not thousands, in a US workforce of more than 150 million workers.

The job growth will continue to be in services, as it has been for a generation, with good jobs going to those with good skills, and low-paying and insecure jobs going to those without them. And with stunning advances in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and robotics, the prospects for further job losses to the robots will multiply.

What can be done

One popular response is to boost the minimum wage. Yet this is a policy tool to be used with caution. Simply declaring a job to be worth $15 an hour doesn't make it so. A recent careful statistical analysis of Seattle's new minimum wage law (rising in two steps to $11 and then $13 an hour) is sobering.

JUST WATCHED Here's why we get overtime pay Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Here's why we get overtime pay 03:04

The study suggests that Seattle suffered a significant loss of jobs at the bottom end of the wage distribution as a result of the boost in minimum wage. This job-loss effect had been rejected in earlier studies of minimum wages, but the Seattle study makes a convincing case that earlier studies that claimed little or no job loss were probably marred by poor data.

Most Republicans assume that faster economic growth would be enough to boost earnings and employment among low-wage workers. This is naÃÂ¯ve. Economic growth boosts the incomes of highly educated workers, not of the majority of young people who do not complete a bachelor's degree. Economic growth is not enough. We need to do three things better.

First, we need to ensure that every child reaches his or her potential in quality education and job skills. Poor children fall behind early, and usually permanently, in America's highly unequal society. The problem is not teachers' unions (the favorite scapegoat of the rich and powerful).

The problem is poverty: growing up in households with very few books, often poorly educated and under-employed parents, neighborhood crime and poverty, and often highly unstable family arrangements. Public schools become the recipients of these social catastrophes, not the creators.

Second, we need to boost the incomes even of lower-skilled and less-educated workers. This is not so hard to do. The earned-income tax credit -- the federal tax credit for low- and moderate-income people -- should be expanded. Remember, the American economy is richer than ever, though more of the income is concentrated at the top.

By taxing those recent gains, and sharing them with lower-skilled workers, all parts of American society can taste the fruits of technological progress. While boosting the minimum wage will reduce work, boosting the EITC will increase it, partly by bringing less-educated people back into the labor market and enabling them to earn a decent wage.

Third, and more generally, we should distinguish between low market earnings and a decent overall living standard. In northern Europe, governments provide child care, pre-K, public schools, college tuition, and free health care for all, financed out of general tax revenues. In that way, less-skilled workers with lower take-home pay can still have a good living standard.

It's similarly time for America, richer than ever in our history, to ensure decent living standards for all Americans, including those with less education, lower skills, and lower earnings."

Richman did share the contents of one memo, he said, but ""the substance of the memo passed on to the Times was not marked classified and to my knowledge remains unclassified.""

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-westar-energy-m-a-gt-plains-energy-idUSKBN19V141,"GREAT PLAINS, WESTAR REVISE $14 BILLION MERGER TO EASE REGULATOR CONCERNS","(Reuters) - Utilities Great Plains Energy Inc (GXP.N) and Westar Energy Inc (WR.N) announced Monday new terms for their proposed $14 billion merger, hoping the revised structure would satisfy regulatory concerns which nixed the previous tie-up plan. The duo spent nearly a year in consolidation talks only for the Kansas Corporation Commission in April to rule against the transaction, insisting the deal as it stood was not in the best interests of the companies' 1.6 million customers in Kansas and Missouri. State regulators have become more proactive in recent months toward utility mergers and acquisitions, intervening in deals as they seek to protect local markets amid tough operating conditions for the power industry. Regulatory considerations are also a big part of the $18 billion-plus battle for Texas' Oncor Electric Delivery Co, which is subject to competing interest from Berkshire Hathaway and Elliott Management. ""I'm okay admitting that we were disappointed with the order in April, but the order was specific in what [the regulator] wanted changed and that they were open to us working together to reach a solution,"" Mark Ruelle, chief executive officer of Westar Energy, told Reuters in a phone interview. The companies are working with all stakeholders including regulators to gain necessary approvals, with the aim of closing the merger in the first half of 2018, according to a joint statement. Under the revised terms, the two firms will approach the tie-up as a merger of equals, with a holding company created, in which Westar Energy shareholders will get one share for each of their current shares, and Great Plains stockholders getting 0.5981 shares for each they own. Previously, Great Plains had proposed buying Westar and making it a subsidiary, using around $8 billion of borrowing: a level of debt with which the Kansas regulator was unhappy. ""The ultimate structure of merger of equals was the only way to meet the interests of both (shareholders and consumers),"" Terry Bassham, chief executive officer of Great Plains, told Reuters. The duo have proposed a one-off pool worth upwards of $50 million, which would be distributed to consumers in 2018, while Westar shareholders should expect a 15 percent increase in dividend payouts to match the payout Great Plains stockholders currently receive. The combined company will also buy back around 30 million shares in both 2018 and 2019, Bassham added. Annual cost savings generated by the merger, rising to $140 million to $170 million in 2021, from $35 million to 45 million next year, would help finance these measures, while also allowing the company to achieve the profit level allowed by a regulated utility without increasing customer rates. U.S. power firms are battling the financial impact of greater consumer efficiency on demand, making mergers which help cut costs attractive.

http://cnn.com/2017/07/10/politics/health-care-state-of-play/index.html,GOP HEALTH CARE BILL ON THE BRINK (AGAIN),"(CNN) The Senate returns for a critical three-week period when Republicans will try to salvage their health care bill. But it's clearly in deep trouble and they might not be able to save it.

Things are looking especially tough after the bill hung out there over the recess (which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell badly wanted to avoid) and it got battered by voters and senators.

Watch Tuesday's Senate lunch -- that's when we might get the first real indications of the week on which direction leadership is moving, and it'll be an opportunity for leaders to take the temperature of the conference on how they're feeling after the week-long recess.

Maybe the clearest sign that things aren't looking good? President Donald Trump's tweet Monday morning : ""I cannot imagine that Congress would dare to leave Washington without a beautiful new HealthCare bill fully approved and ready to go!""

CNN's latest whip count on the ""no"" votes: 10

At least 10. Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota became at least the 10th GOP senator to publicly oppose the bill in its current form with remarks he made to local media and a public statement released during the July 4 holiday.

*First caveat: 10 = only the Republicans who have publicly said no. There could be more, and other Republicans -- while perhaps not saying directly that they'd oppose the legislation as written -- described concerns or reservations they had about the current proposal.

*Second caveat: Plenty of the ""no"" folks have said they want to get to a yes, and some ultimately could.

What's the deal with McConnell?

What he said in Kentucky last week: Republicans might need to work with Democrats to prop up Obamacare if they fail to pass repeal and replace legislation.

No, McConnell isn't giving up on health care, and he's not yet close to pulling the plug. (And these weren't new comments -- McConnell has brought up the possibility of having to work with Democrats to stabilize markets the day he delayed the vote two weeks ago.)

Two ways to read McConnell's comments:

This has been a genuinely difficult process. The needle that he's trying to thread to get to 50 ""yes"" votes is very, very tough. It's not a secret that there is real frustration about how long the health care exercise has dragged on.

This is a warning shot to Republicans -- They can either suck it up, and vote for a bill that isn't perfect (and it's never going to be perfect for everyone). Or they can let the bill fail and stomach the political reality of reneging on a promise they've been making for years and years -- and the fact that the next necessary step would be to work with Democrats to do damage control on Obamacare.

What happened over the July 4 recess?

JUST WATCHED Collins still a 'no' on GOP health care bill Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Collins still a 'no' on GOP health care bill 00:53

Exactly as McConnell had feared and expected -- Senate Republicans got an earful over the July 4 recess. Just a sampling of the political heat GOP senators got when they went home last week:

Hoeven made clear he was against the bill.

Sen. Susan Collins: People in Maine are telling her ""they don't want me to support it.""

Sen. Jerry Moran: Said at a town hall in Palco, Kansas, that he's still a no , and that the bill would hurt rural communities.

Sen. Dean Heller, who is currently a ""no"" on the bill, got yelled at by a man back home to vote for the bill. So the pressure goes both ways.

Protesters cropped up everywhere: Outside Sen. Pat Toomey's office; at a Sen. Ted Cruz event in Texas and inside two offices of Sen. Rob Portman in Ohio

What happened over the weekend?

Sen. John McCain did not sound optimistic about his party's chances when he told CBS' John Dickerson on ""Face the Nation"" when he said the health care proposal was ""probably going to be dead.""

""I fear that it's going to fail, and then we should convene a Republican Conference and say, what are we going to do? Introduce a bill,"" the Arizona Republican said Sunday. ""Say to the Democrats, here's a bill. It doesn't mean they don't -- that they control it. It means they can have amendments considered. And even when they lose, then they're part of the process. That's what democracy is supposed to be all about.""

Also Vice President Mike Pence -- who's been active with Hill Republicans' health care discussions -- went horseback riding Saturday with Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference Roy Blunt of Missouri as well as another crucial White House voice on health care: Seema Verma , administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

What changes could be made to the bill?

Short answer is we don't know yet what the revised bill will look like. Those conversations will have to happen this week. But we do know at least two potential revisions to the bill that were sent to the Congressional Budget Office for scoring before members left town for the July 4 recess:

The Cruz amendment: Known as the ""consumer freedom"" amendment, it would allow insurers who offer plans under Obamacare to also offer plans that are unregulated under the law. (Conservatives like this, because they say it would lower premiums; critics -- including some moderate Republicans -- hate it, because they think it means skyrocketing premiums for the sick, as well as weakened protections for those with pre-existing conditions.)

Flexibility for Health Savings Accounts: Another provision that conservatives find appealing, it would offer more flexibility on how people can use HSAs, including using them to pay for premiums.

Don't expect that Cruz amendment to be a silver bullet. A telling comment from one GOP aide last week : ""I think there's very little interest in the caucus in touching pre-existing conditions, so I have a hard time seeing the addition of the 'Consumer Choice Amendment.' And outside health policy folks have said that would set up a death spiral for the markets.""

Asked about the Cruz amendment, Marc Short, White House legislative affairs director, said: ""The White House is very comfortable with the policy. I think the question we all need to address is does it add votes or subtract votes?""

'We'll have a better sense this week after it is scored"" and after Cruz talks with more senators himself.

What is the White House saying?

Short acknowledged that the messaging around the health care repeal effort has not been strong and faults all parties involved -- including the administration and congressional Republicans.

""I think it's fair to say the messaging throughout has been underwhelming, collectively, among Republicans,"" Short told CNN over the weekend. ""It's a complicated subject.""

Short said a lot of things were under discussion when it comes to how Trump might engage in this sales effort, but was reluctant to say for sure what the President would do beyond additional phone calls.

""You might see the President travel,"" he said. ""You might see more messaging coming from him too."" Short would not expand on what that messaging could look or sound like.

If the President does travel to try to sell the bill, he is likely to visit states of wavering Republicans, like Ohio or West Virginia -- though there are no plans for travel set in stone.

A vote next week?

There will be a vote when McConnell decides he has 50 ""yes"" votes. He's not there yet.

Talk from the White House of a possible vote next week? Just remember how many times the White House predicted votes when the House was considering its bill earlier this year, and how many times those predictions were not accurate. The White House doesn't determine the Senate schedule.

When will we see new CBO score(s)?

Still unclear. But, Senate GOP leaders have been in constant touch with CBO -- all so that when they're ready to pull the trigger, they can get a score from the CBO as quickly as possible.

Short said he expects the CBO score on the latest drafts in the next seven to 10 days.

""This week will be more focused on continuing to talk about the policy that is in the bill with the various senators that are undecided,"" he said."
http://cnn.com/2017/07/07/asia/moon-jae-in-south-north-korea/index.html,"SOUTH KOREA'S MOON: I'LL MEET KIM 'AT ANY TIME, AT ANY PLACE'","(CNN) South Korea's president has doubled down on diplomacy at a time when tensions all around him are rising.

Days after North Korea announced it had successfully tested its first operational intercontintental ballistic missile (ICBM) , South Korea's Moon Jae-in declared he'd be willing to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ""at any time, at any place"" -- circumstances permitting.

Speaking in Berlin ahead of G20 talks in Hamburg, Moon said the reunification of East and West Germany gave him hope that peace could be achieved on the Korean Peninsula.

""To Korea, which is the last divided nation on this planet, the experience of Germany's unification gives hope for unification, and at the same time shows us the path that we need to follow,"" he said.

Moon's defense of diplomacy echoed former President Roh Moo-hyun's ""sunshine policy"" towards Pyongyang, and his predecessor Kim Dae-jung's ""Berlin Doctrine,"" outlined in the German capital 17 years ago.

Moon described North Korea's missile launch as ""disappointing"" and ""reckless.""

""Because we have reached the tipping point of the vicious circle of military escalation, and thus, the need for dialogue is more pressing than ever before,"" he said.

Rock and a hard place

Moon is a man stuck in the middle. On one hand, he is trying to maintain the possibility of talks, while on the other, he faces pressure from the South's most powerful ally, the United States, to deliver a more robust response.

While China and Russia have called for concessions on both sides, the US has so far made no public move to open talks, instead opting to engage in a renewed show of force with Seoul through joint military exercises

US President Donald Trump's administration is increasingly hawkish on the issue of North Korea.

In a news conference Thursday with Polish President Andrzej Duda, Trump said he has ""some pretty severe things"" available to him when asked about military action against North Korea.

""As far as North Korea is concerned, I don't know, we will see what happens,"" said Trump. ""I have some pretty severe things that we are thinking about. That doesn't mean we are going to do it. I don't draw red lines.""

Most analysts agree that a military strike on North Korea could put the South Korean capital of Seoul -- which is only dozens of miles from the Demilitarized Zone separating the two countries -- in grave danger from a retaliatory strike from Kim.

Russian President Vladimir Putin had earlier hosted Xi in Moscow, where the countries issued a joint statement, articulating a common peace plan for the peninsula, and together condemning US militarization in the region.

""It is very important to push forward our joint initiative on settling the Korean problem with a view of immediately freezing the ballistic missile strikes and also dealing with the US deployment of weapons in South Korea,"" Putin said.

New threat

North Koreans gathered in the capital Pyongyang Thursday for a mass rally and fireworks to celebrate Tuesday's successful test-launch of the missile, which the regime says could be used to deliver a nuclear warhead to the US.

Soldiers of the Korean People's Army (KPA) watch a fireworks displayin Pyongyang on July 6, 2017, as part of celebrations marking the July 4 launch of the Hwasong-14.

The fireworks in Pyongyang came as Moon dined with Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the US consulate in Hamburg Thursday. Trump tweeted about the meeting, but did not give details of the discussion.

""Great trilateral meeting & dinner w/ President ShinzÃÂ Abe of Japan & President Moon Jae-in of South Korea @ the @usconshamburg this evening,"" tweeted Trump.

The tweet, since deleted, mischaracterizes the Japanese leader's title.

Still searching for a solution to the North Korea question, Moon has been participating in meetings with key players in the crisis ahead of Friday's G20 summit in Hamburg.

Meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday, Moon asked Beijing to ""take a leading role as a member nation of the UNSC (the United Nations Security Council).""

Xi said that China is ""doing its best to prevent North Korea from advancing (its) nuclear and missile program.""

Following their dinner Thursday in Hamburg, Trump answered one shouted question from journalists on whether he had ""given up"" on Xi as a partner in the effort to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons.

""Never give up,"" he replied.

Faced with a geopolitical conundrum on North Korea, it is a sentiment that Moon would do well to remember."

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-lubin-healthcare-commentary-idUSKBN19H2MW,COMMENTARY: THE BIGGEST VICTIMS OF THE SENATE HEALTH BILL (AND OTHER TRUMP PLANS),"Donald Trump asked Senate Republicans to introduce a healthcare bill with more heart. They didnt.  The senators draft legislation, introduced last Thursday, will strip tens of millions of low-income and middle-class Americans of their health insurance. Millions more will face higher costs for lower coverage. The Congressional Budget office estimates 22 million more people will likely be uninsured by 2026 than would be if the Affordable Care Act remained law.  The Senate bill will cut the number of people eligible for subsidies that reduce monthly premiums and lower out-of-pocket costs for insurance bought on the Affordable Care Act health exchanges. It will defund Planned Parenthood for one year, which is an important source of preventive and primary care services for millions of low-income women and women of color. It strikes at the heart of health care services for the poor by ending Medicaid expansion in 2021 and changing the way states receive federal funding  another measure that will cause cuts in the program.  These cuts will be on top of the $600 billion that the presidents budget seeks to eliminate from the program over the next 10 years.  During his election campaign, Trumps outreach to black voters effectively comprised the question What do you have to lose? That answer has become clear.  The presidents effort to repeal Obamacare, coupled with rollbacks in civil-rights enforcement and massive cuts to safety net programs, are moving the country backward. The Senate health bill is the latest in a string of efforts to dismantle programs and policies that benefit all Americans, and are especially critical in closing racial disparities in health, income, education, housing and policing.   MORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY Dan DePetris: Trump should go easy on North Korea over Warmbier death Peter Apps: The dangers of putting Putin under pressure Josh Cohen: How Trump can show hes tough on anti-Semitism The administrations effort to do away with the Affordable Care Act is at the top of the list of actions that will hit people of color hardest. Although every racial and ethnic group benefited from greater access to insurance, the reduction in the uninsured rate for African Americans, Native Americans and Latinos, was near double that experienced by whites in the first year the law took effect. Much of this improvement was because of Medicaid expansion under the Obama program.  The attack on Medicaid is especially concerning given its role in providing rural and urban children and families with access to health care. Medicaid covers one in five Americans, including poor adults, seniors and people with disabilities. Half of all births nationwide are covered by the program.  Beyond the assault on health care programs, the presidents budget will cut taxes for the wealthy and increase defense spending by $54 billion while slashing programs that provide help to low-income individuals, families and communities. It will cut billions of dollars from food and nutrition, housing, and community development programs that poor families and communities rely on to meet basic living needs.  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides food stamps to help working families meet their nutritional needs. Funding for the program will be reduced by more than 25 percent, or $193 billion, over 10 years. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which provides federal funding for state-based income support and work programs for poor families, would be cut by $22 billion during the same period. And the Department of Housing and Urban Developments budget will be slashed by nearly 15 percent or $7.4 billion. At a time the nation faces an affordable housing crisis, funding for homeless programs, direct rental assistance and home-buying programs are being drastically reduced.     If Trump has his way, other programs, such as the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program that helps pay for heat and electricity, and the Community Development Block Grant program that helps revitalize economically depressed neighborhoods will be eliminated.  The environmental justice program within the Environmental Protection Agency is also slated to be shut down. Low-income communities are more likely to have poorer air and water quality and have historically been targeted for dumping of toxic pollutants. Environmental justice initiatives have been key in remedying this imbalance. The Flint water crisis was an unfortunate reminder that our communities remain vulnerable to high levels of lead and other environmental inequities that have lasting impact on health.  The closing of the environmental justice office at EPA is part of the Trump administrations broad strategy to reduce civil rights enforcement by federal agencies. The office of civil rights within the Education Department is also targeted for cuts and a similar office in the Labor Department will be eliminated.  Then there are the efforts to roll back Obama-era criminal justice reforms. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has called for harsher sentences for low-level drug offenders - again a measure that will disproportionately affect racial minorities. Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to be charged and to receive longer sentences than whites for similar crimes regardless of prior criminal history or severity of the crime. Despite similar rates of drug use, blacks are 10 times more likely to be incarcerated for drug use compared to whites. Sessions has also signaled that his Justice Department will not enforce consent decree agreements that have played a key role in holding police departments accountable for civil rights abuses  another area in which minority communities have been disproportionately singled out.   These policies are chipping away at the nations health and sustainability. The U.S. will be a minority-majority nation in a few decades. It is not in our national interest to marginalize Americans of color.    (Judy Lubin, PhD, MPH, is Director of Allies for Reaching Community Health Equity at the Center for Global Policy Solutions, co-founder of Sociologists of Justice and an ARCHE Public Voices Fellow of The OpEd Project.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-train-idUSKBN19V0ZF,NEW YORK COMMUTERS TAKE DISRUPTIVE TRACK REPAIRS IN STRIDE,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Commuters were warned to expect hell going to and from New York City, but on the first day of disruptive repairs at the nation's busiest rail hub on Monday many said their rides were no worse than usual for the crowded, delay-prone transit system. Some, noting the sunny weather, even enjoyed being diverted onto a free, specially arranged ferry across the Hudson River.  The three railroads that carry tens of thousands of people each day to and from Pennsylvania Station in midtown Manhattan have canceled some trains and rerouted others for the eight weeks the work on the tracks is expected to take. Some riders from New Jersey complained about lengthened commutes, while noting they were already used to delays after a string of derailments and stalled trains at the station this year that the repairs are intended to remedy. Many riders and transit officials attributed the relatively smooth start to a successful public awareness campaign, including numerous station attendants who answered questions, handed out pamphlets and herded disoriented passengers. ""Tickets out!"" one attendant bellowed at New Jersey's Hoboken Terminal, on the opposite side of the Hudson River from Manhattan. ""This way to the 39th Street ferry!"" shouted another. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had predicted a ""summer of hell"" for commuters as the repairs continued through to Sept. 1. Bill McLeer, who works in data analysis and was waiting in an unusually subdued Penn Station for a train home to Mount Laurel in New Jersey, called the governor's warning ""completely overblown."" And some commuters relished a free ride on a ferry that normally costs $9.   ""It's my first time,"" said David Lawner, a database administrator from West Orange, New Jersey, as he marveled at the warm breezes of the ferry's open-top deck. ""Isn't this relaxing?""   Another ferry rider, Kathleen Lynn, was less rhapsodic. ""It's going to add 20 minutes,"" said Lynn, a Summit, New Jersey, resident who works in financial services. ""Or an hour. Depends on whether everything hooks up."" Penn Station, an underground maze of low ceilings and mediocre dining spots built in the 1960s, serves about 95,000 New Jersey Transit customers and about 116,000 Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) customers on an average weekday, according to 2016 data. Amtrak, the national passenger rail corporation and the station's owner, says an average of 28,000 rides a day on its intercity services begin or end in Penn Station. The commuter crunch highlights lagging investment in U.S. infrastructure, and especially in New York City, which is dependent on mass transit.  Even so, Amtrak reported most of its trains ran on time or close to it, and the Penn Station departures board showed no delays during the evening rush. ""We've had a good commute this morning,"" Amtrak's president, Charles ""Wick"" Moorman, said in an interview. ""It's the first morning of a long process, but right now we feel good."" Joe Lhota, who oversees the LIRR as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's chairman, praised riders, saying ""they did everything perfect today."" ""Tomorrow is another day, we start afresh,"" he told reporters during the evening rush. ""We're expecting thunderstorms in the morning.""

She also was a consultant for Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Follow her: @jrpsaki . The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.

(CNN) The Russians just played the President. It was predictable. And he let it happen.

On paper, Vladimir Putin should not have had the upper hand going into the meeting.

To start with, Russia has been living with sanctions put in place more than three years ago because of their annexation of Crimea.

And most Americans, save a few people including the President of the United States, are confident that Putin led the Russian intervention into the American election and into many other elections around the world.

President Obama booted out nearly three dozen spies in December and closed two compounds, and there are many, from both parties, calling for an additional round of sanctions on Russia

We should have had some leverage. So what happened?

To start with, the Russians are skilled public manipulators.

When I was at the State Department, the country that was easiest for our team to work with on logistics -- whether it was access to the press, or when to do statements or take questions -- were the Russians. They understand, better than most, the importance of the public side of diplomacy. It made planning easy, but it also required on-the-fly adjustments to make sure that the Russians didn't read out meetings or characterize conversations without the perspective of the United States. And they still got the best of us from time to time.

They know how to stage-manage and how to set the expectations for global events. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is a smooth operator who knows how to charm cameras and international audiences. He is visible at international events and followed by a gaggle of adoring state-run media. He also rarely shies away from answering questions, holding press conferences, or reading out meetings. He has been on the international scene as foreign minister for 13 years, and as the UN ambassador for 10 years before that, and it shows.

Putin may have less of a warm diplomatic bedside manner, but he understands the art of presentation and how to set a trap.

And set a trap is exactly what he just did.

The Russians telegraphed in advance of the meeting that their agenda was to 1) publicly mend the relationship, 2) gain a better understanding of US policy, and 3) discuss joint concerns over terrorism. They scored on all three.

Their previewing kept expectations low and made clear that there simply would not be enough time to talk about Ukraine.

And how did the United States preview the meeting and set the table for the most important diplomatic engagement this summer?

JUST WATCHED Coons: Trump raising election meddling with Putin 'long overdue' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Coons: Trump raising election meddling with Putin 'long overdue' 03:16

Just yesterday, President Donald Trump questioned the validity of American intelligence on foreign soil and then questioned whether other countries or actors were involved in the hacking.

But before that, H.R. McMaster, the President's national security adviser, previewed the meeting with President Putin by saying there was ""no specific agenda -- it's really going to be whatever the President wants to talk about.""

The problem is that the expectation-setting and previewing of important diplomatic meetings does more than just fill wire reports and cable air time. It sends the message about what the United States expects to accomplish, how prepared we are for the engagement and also puts the difficult topics on the table that are the core purpose of these meetings.

We did a background briefing with policy experts in advance of nearly every trip Secretary John Kerry did when I was at the State Department. These briefings were often on the plane late at night or early in the morning, sometimes at Andrews Air Force Base and even on the ground. They were demanded by the press corps, but also benefitted the United States because they allowed us to set the table for our engagements.

JUST WATCHED Things Trump has said about Putin Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Things Trump has said about Putin 01:27

Immediately following the meeting, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson appeared on television making clear that President Trump had repeatedly raised Russian meddling in the meeting. That sounded like a positive development until he said President Trump has decided to focus on ""how do we move forward from something that may be an intractable disagreement at this point.""

This statement was quickly followed by Foreign Minister Lavrov appearing on television to say that President Putin had denied involvement, Trump said reports of meddling were exaggerated and he accepted Putin's denials.

Leading American intelligence agencies , Republicans and Democrats in Congress and many members of his own administration are confident that the Russians intervened in the American election last year. But a simple assurance from President Putin overrides that.

You don't get a lot of shots at pressure in diplomacy. And after you've let your adversary off the hook, you certainly don't get to apply that pressure again. As far as the Russians are concerned, the public case is closed.

Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook

The problem is that the free public pass doesn't make it harder for Russians to proceed with their ongoing efforts to intervene in American democracy, to create confusion and disarray in our system.

And there are ample opportunities.

And instead of presenting evidence during his meeting with President Putin and making clear that he would stand with Democrats and Republicans and the leading intelligence agencies, Trump accepted the assurances of Putin all while smiling in front of the cameras. And the Russians have photos -- that they are already expertly spreading around the Internet -- to prove it."
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-08/yellen-bet-on-pulling-workers-back-to-labor-force-is-paying-off,YELLEN BET ON PULLING WORKERS BACK TO LABOR FORCE IS PAYING OFF,"Even as U.S. unemployment crept lower in recent years, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen stuck with a glacial pace of policy tightening that she justified with a powerful message: there were still millions of potential workers to pull in from the labor markets sidelines.The latest news from the labor market is proving her right.While Junes U.S. payroll report keeps the central bank on track to raise rates once more this year and begin unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, it also suggests that Yellens decision to hold interest rates lower than some critics and colleagues preferred has helped heal some of the harm done by the Great Recession.Her goal was to foster a sustained recovery that would help to draw Americans who had dropped out of the labor force back into employment. This was a gamble. If workers hadnt come back, the strategy could have spurred an overly-tight labor market that sent wages and inflation up too quickly. That in turn could have forced the Fed to raise rates more aggressively and put the recovery at risk.But come back they have. The flow of people moving from outside of the labor force straight into jobs jumped in June to 4.7 million, its highest level in records that go back to 1990. Labor force participation has stabilized after a long-run decline, and the share of the population that works continues to rise moderately. And as long-hidden labor market slack gets absorbed, it could be helping to keep wage gains modest and inflation in check.The surge of job holders coming from outside the labor force speaks to the reduction in slack in the labor force, said Tom Simons, a senior economist at Jefferies LLC in New York. For the Fed this is a very encouraging sign and fits the narrative that theyre going to continue on with their normalization plan.Yellen, who argues that strong hiring will feed through to higher wages and price pressures in time, can explain her labor-market views further when she delivers semi-annual testimony to Congress this month. She speaks to the House Financial Services Committee on July 12 and the Senate Banking Committee on July 13.She said in October 2016 that a tight labor market might draw in potential workers who would otherwise sit on the sidelines, noting that it was possible that strong economic conditions can partially reverse supply-side damage after it has occurred.More recently, she and her colleagues have said that theyre closing in on full employment, and shes tiptoed closer to suggesting that slack has been absorbed, though she never declared total victory. She said in January that the labor market was reasonably close to the committees maximum employment objective, for instance, and that the cyclical element of participation declines had largely disappeared.The latest data could vindicate the idea that potential workers may have been lingering on the sidelines. The Fed has lifted rates only slowly, and the effect on the economy has been limited as financial conditions remain easy. Against that backdrop, employers continue to hire rapidly, taking on 222,000 new workers last month.The labor market and the participation rate are reflective of the Feds policy and what its meant for the economy, said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Plc in New York.It seems theyve finally scraped bottom when it comes to people who are actively applying to jobs and thus classed as unemployed. Unemployment was 4.4 percent in June, up from a 16-year low of 4.3 percent the month before, and the share of people moving from unemployment to jobs has moved lower.As that has happened, employers have begun to tap sidelined labor pools. The shift has helped to stabilize -- and now slightly lift -- the labor force participation rate, which measures what share of the population is working or looking for a job. Thats an especially sweet accomplishment for the Fed because it flies in the face of demographic trends, which should be weighing the rate down.The flattening is consistent with an overall picture of improving labor market conditions, the Fed said in its Monetary Policy Report to Congress, released Friday in Washington.Still, its worth noting that labor flows data are volatile, and the pop in June doesnt necessarily portend a sustained trend where people move back from the sidelines.Because it is so choppy, you want to be careful about looking at the month itself, said Omair Sharif, senior U.S. economist at Societe Generale. This idea that, oh, were pulling in all these workers from the sidelines -- I dont think thats the case.Meanwhile pay has been slow to accelerate, even though employers report shortages in workers across many industries. If theres a hidden slice of the workforce willing to take positions even though theyre not actively seeking them, that could be one factor allowing companies to keep pay hikes moderate.Its hard bringing people back in, but it seems like its happening, said Raymond Stone, managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, New Jersey."

http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/10/technology/startup-visa-immigration-parole-status-delayed/index.html?section=money_topstories,'STARTUP VISA' ALTERNATIVE DELAYED BY TRUMP ADMINISTRATION,"The Trump administration is putting the brakes on an Obama-era rule that would help foreign entrepreneurs stay in the U.S. to build their startups.

The rule, announced in January 2017, was supposed to go into effect July 17, but the Department of Homeland Security issued a memo on Monday pushing the launch to March 14, 2018.

According to the memo, DHS will solicit comments from the public about rescinding the rule, and ""may ultimately eliminate the program.""

Under the International Entrepreneurs Rule, foreigners building ""fast-growing businesses"" could apply for ""parole status"" to work in the U.S. That status is typically only granted to individuals who need a visa to work on humanitarian or medical relief.

It's intended to be an alternative to the startup visa, which was a part of the stalled 2013 immigration reform bill.

Some countries like Canada and France have already implemented visa changes to cater to entrepreneurs. But those looking to stay in the U.S. must rely on existing visas, like the H-1B, which is a popular visa for high-skilled workers.

But that visa requires foreigners to show they can be hired, fired and paid by an employer. These requirements make it is difficult to launch a company. Some entrepreneurs choose to start their businesses elsewhere.

In a statement sent to CNN Tech, DHS said that since a new executive order in January, it has been ""carefully reviewing all [United States Citizenship and Immigration Services] policies related to parole authority, including this rule.""

The Obama administration had expected about 2,940 applications under the new rule per year.

Some entrepreneurs, immigration lawyers and advocacy groups have expressed disappointed with the news.

""Today's announcement runs completely contrary to President Trump's stated objectives of creating opportunities and job growth for Americans,"" said a spokeswoman for the American Immigration Lawyers Association in a statement send to CNN Tech. ""This is not good immigration policy and not good for entrepreneurs or for our nation as a whole, particularly given that so many working Americans are looking for job opportunities.""

Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us -- an immigration reform group launched by Facebook (FB, Tech30) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other tech leaders -- called the decision a ""setback.""

""We should be encouraging innovators to bring their new ideas, expertise, and unique skills to our country, rather than incentivizing them to put their talents to work for our competitors abroad,"" said Shulte in a statement.

PayPal (PYPL, Tech30) cofounder Max Levchin, who is originally from the Ukraine, tweeted: ""As an immigrant & entrepreneur that has created tens of thousands of jobs here in the U.S. I am beyond disappointed in this decision."""

Entitlement programs should allow for the security and prosperity of all Americans, she writes

Stephanie Coontz is director of research at the Council on Contemporary Families, which is hosted by the University of Texas at Austin. She is the author, most recently, of The Way We Never Were: American Families and the Nostalgia Trap. The views expressed in this commentary are her own.

(CNN) In a letter to The Wall Street Journal this week, Ivanka Trump gave a robust defense of the Trump administration's proposed paid family leave program. The Journal's editorial board had denounced it as a government ""entitlement"" that ""could create another disincentive for work and advancement.""

Ms. Trump indignantly denied that paid leave was an ""entitlement,"" a word that has become an epithet in American politics. Rather, she said, it's ""an investment in America's working families.""

Stephanie Coontz

But whether consciously or not, Ms. Trump's defense represents a stinging rebuke to the combination of lofty rhetoric and callous policies emanating from the new administration and Congress. She frankly admits that the unregulated market, hailed by so many politicians as the ultimate creator of jobs and prosperity for all, has failed ""those who need these benefits the most."" She added, ""The poorest, most vulnerable workers in our society get left behind"" by business-provided work-family policies.

Fewer than 10% of individuals in the lowest 25% of earners have access to paid family leave. As a result, they often lose or are forced to quit their jobs after having a child. And this, Ms. Trump notes, results in far greater damage to their prospects for future work and advancement, and ""a far greater cost to society over the long term,"" than the government funding required to support ""healthier children and parents in more tightly bonded families"" with a ""stronger attachment to the labor force"" in the long run.

Of course, however Ms. Trump frames it, paid leave would indeed be an entitlement -- and an investment. A new mother or father is entitled to paid leave; the child is entitled to bond with its parents. And government makes an investment in parents' ability to put food on the table while they are at home and to return to work without having sacrificed their prospects for advancement."

Yet at virtually every turn, that case has already been presented in scripted dramas.

Drug dealers remain go-to bad guys in TV and movies. Dating back to David Simon's landmark HBO drama ""The Wire"" and miniseries ""The Corner,"" though, television has drilled into the hopelessness of law enforcement's efforts -- depicting what amounts to a giant game of Whac-a-Mole, where cutting off from one spigot simply opens another.

The condemnation of the policy, moreover, is often conveyed more poignantly through dramas like ""The Wire,"" which can personalize character arcs and put faces -- even if they're fictional -- on the statistics.

A bleak new FX drama premiering this week, ""Snowfall,"" seeks to join this tradition. The show hearkens back to the ""Just Say No"" era, chronicling the rise of crack cocaine in the 1980s.

Container lines from Denmark to Japan have pursued acquisitions as too many ships and companies chasing the same trade has led to a collapse in freight rates and burgeoning losses, reasons that pushed Hanjin Shipping Co. of Korea into bankruptcy last year.This looks like a happy ending for both parties, said Han Ning, China director for Drewry Shipping Consultants Ltd. Cosco can benefit from OOCLs strong presence on routes from the Far East to Australia and to the U.S. The companys operational efficiency has long been admired by outsiders as well.The enlarged company will operate more than 400 vessels with capacity exceeding 2.9 million twenty-foot equivalent units, including order book. Cosco currently has a market share of 8.4 percent while Orient Overseas has 3.2 percent, according to Alphaliner. Their combined 11.6 percent share would make the merged entity the third-biggest container-shipping company, overtaking CMA CGM with 11.2 percent, according to the shipping data provider.UBS Group AG advised the buyers, while JPMorgan Chase & Co. worked with Orient Overseas.Tungs family controls Orient Overseas International with about 69 percent holding. Shares of the company have rallied almost 90 percent this year in Hong Kong, compared with a 15 percent gain in the benchmark Hang Seng Index.If the offer is accepted by the rest of the shareholders, Cosco and its unit will have to pay a total of about HK$49.2 billion ($6.3 billion) to close the transaction, they said.This decision has been carefully considered and we believe it helps ensure the future success of OOIL, Andy Tung, chief executive officer of Orient Overseas, said in a statement. We are confident that Cosco Shipping Holdings is the right partner for us.On completion of the deal, Cosco Shipping will hold 90.1 percent of Orient Overseas, while Shanghai International Port will hold 9.9 percent. The buyers plan to keep the shares of Orient Overseas listed after the closing of the offer and commit to retain all employees and their benefits, they said.The heads of Maersk and Hyundai Merchant Marine Co. have said in the past that Asian container lines are set for further consolidation in 2017 as firms join forces to cut costs and improve efficiency.The shipping industry is fragmented  and consolidation can help transform the business for the benefit of customers, Maersk, the worlds biggest container operator, said Monday in reaction to Coscos takeover. There is a consolidation wave in the industry and it is difficult to say how big it will be, the company said.The global container industry has been in turmoil since the 2008 financial crisis brought trading to its knees. South Koreas biggest container-shipping line Hanjin filed for bankruptcy protection last year while Maersk restructured its operations.CMA CGM then completed a $2.3 billion acquisition of Neptune Orient Lines Ltd. Japans Nippon Yusen KK, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. agreed to merge their container operations, creating a company with about 6.9 percent market share. Maersk also agreed to buy Hamburg Sud for 3.7 billion euros.The three Japanese shipping lines all climbed more than 3 percent in intraday trading in Tokyo on Monday.This might be the last of the major M&As we see in the shipping industry, said Jason Chiang, Singapore-based director at Ocean Shipping Consultants. Bad times in the industry made M&As necessary but with rates recovering that need will become less. With assistance by Kyunghee Park, and Dong Lyu"
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-azure-idUSKBN19V1KQ,MICROSOFT TO OFFER LOCAL VERSION OF AZURE CLOUD SERVICE,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Monday unveiled a new service that allows customers to use its cloud technology on their own servers, part of the company's efforts to refocus its product line to compete more effectively with rivals Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google. The world's biggest software maker is looking to carve out a niche among customers who cannot or do not want to move all their computing operations to the massive shared data centers that are collectively known as the cloud.  One of the key differentiations we have with Azure versus our two biggest competitors in the cloud platform space is our ability to support true hybrid solutions, Judson Althoff, Microsoft's executive vice president of worldwide commercial business, told Reuters.  Azure is Microsoft's cloud-computing platform, pegged by most market share studies as second in cloud computing behind Amazon Web Services. Dell EMC, Lenovo Group Ltd and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co will provide new servers and equipment needed to run the service, Microsoft said. The companies will ship the first systems to customers in September. Julia White, corporate vice president of Azure, said that the new service, called Azure Stack, is aimed at businesses that want to use Azure but have specific needs for a localized version of the software.  Azure Stack is an extension of Azure, White said. Its not a replacement for your legacy private cloud. White said Azure Stack could be used by companies with operations in remote locations where it can be difficult to get an internet connection, such as oil rigs or cruise ships, or those in regions with regulations that require that data be kept locally. Weve seen a lot of pent-up demand from end-user customers as well as third-party providers who are anxious to deploy this solution, said Gartner analyst Ed Anderson. I anticipate that this offering will provide a significant boost to Microsofts overall cloud business.     Microsoft also announced Microsoft 365, a service that allows customers to purchase the Office 365 productivity suite, Windows 10 and other services in one bundle.      The product announcements, part of the company's Inspire customer conference in Washington, come just days after news that Microsoft plans to lay off thousands of sales reps.  Microsoft is reorganizing to simplify its sales and marketing efforts and put more emphasis on partnerships with services companies such as KPMG.

His adventures would cast a spell over the world, enchanting children in scores of languages and selling millions of copies.

In an interview with CNN, Rowling revealed that she has written yet another fairy tale -- but this one may never be published.

Rowling, who famously wrote her first novel longhand in Edinburgh cafÃÂ©s, says that she scrawled the secret manuscript across her 50th birthday party dress. In a disclosure that will shock many die-hard Harry Potter fans, the ""book"" now hangs in her closet.

Rowling dropped the bombshell at the end of an interview about her children's charity Lumos, in which she discussed her worst fears and why she is determined to put an end to orphanages.

CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: I read that you were considering writing a political book for children, young people?

J.K. ROWLING: Oh, that was a fairy tale ...

But I -- I will tell you this. On my 50th -- the theme of my 50th birthday, which I held at Halloween, even though that's not really my birthday, was come as your own private nightmare. And I went as a lost manuscript. And I wrote over a dress most of that book. So that book, I don't know whether it will ever be published, but it's actually hanging in a wardrobe currently.

AMANPOUR: How would you decide that this [starting her children's charity Lumos] was your mission?

ROWLING: What drew me in was one child. It was a news report about one child in a newspaper.

I was pregnant and therefore perhaps particularly vulnerable and emotional to anything to do with small children. And I'm flicking through the Sunday paper and I saw what -- still I see it in my memory. It was a very disturbing image of a very small boy screaming through chicken wire.

And I went to turn the page. I'm not proud of it, but I did go to turn the page. And then I -- I stopped and I thought, if the story is as bad as the picture looks, then you have to do something about it.

So I turned back and I read the story. And the story was about an institution in the Czech Republic where this boy, among many other children with special needs, was being kept, I would say, at least 20 hours out of 24 in a cage-bed, which is exactly as it sounds. It's a cot for a baby covered in -- covered in mesh, covered in wire. And that was his existence. And from that, that's how it all began. I was just appalled and horrified.

Rowling on her worst fear

ROWLING: I think my worst fear, my personal worst fear, is powerlessness and small spaces. So when you think about that little boy trapped in the cage-bed, he is totally voiceless. And nobody was speaking for him.

And I think that -- we all have something that touches us on a very visceral level. I mean -- and I think that's mine. That's my thing.

AMANPOUR: And small spaces, why?

ROWLING: I don't know. I've always had that. And I think that just the idea that these children were being kept penned like this was horrific to me. But then so although I didn't think that's like Harry in his cupboard, I suppose why did I put Harry in the cupboard? Because this is my fear, being trapped and being powerless, just powerless to get out of that space. So yeah, on a very crude level, I think that news story tapped into something that I found personally horrifying.

ROWLING: Oh, because my publisher, who published Harry Potter, they said to me, we think this is a book that will appeal to boys and girls. And I said, oh, great. And they said, so could we use your initials?

Because, basically they were trying to disguise my gender. And obviously, that lasted about three seconds, because -- which is wonderful. I'm certainly not complaining, but the book won an award and I got a big advance from America and I got a lot of publicity. So I was outed as a woman.

AMANPOUR: And you're a strong woman role model.

ROWLING: Well, that's right. I quite like J.K. ... I think I -- I wouldn't have chosen it. It's -- and I wouldn't have chosen it for that reason, either.

But I was so grateful to be published, if they told me to call myself Rupert, I probably would have done to be honest with you. But now, I actually quite like having a pen name, because I feel that's -- to an extent, that feels like an identity and then I'm -- in private life, I'm Jo Murray.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/25/opinions/colbert-president-2020-trump-obeidallah-opinion/index.html,PRESIDENT STEPHEN COLBERT IN 2020?,"Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio's daily program ""The Dean Obeidallah Show"" and a columnist for The Daily Beast. Follow him @deanofcomedy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. For more on comedy, catch CNN's ""The History of Comedy"" Sundays at 10 p.m. ET/PT.

That has a nice sound to it, and given Colbert's comments over the weekend , perhaps the late night host is truly thinking of running against Donald Trump in 2020. And if he did, Colbert very well could be the ideal candidate to crush the current President come November 2020.

Colbert's remarks came Friday during an appearance on the Russian late night TV show, ""Evening Urgant."" While being interviewed by the show's host, Ivan Urgant, Colbert revealed that he had a big announcement. Then, with a straight face, Colbert declared , ""I am here to announce that I am considering a run for president in 2020."" As the audience applauded, Colbert quipped, ""And I thought it would be better to cut out the middleman and just tell the Russians myself.""

He added , ""If anyone would like to work on my campaign in an unofficial capacity, please just let me know.""

Yes, Stephen Colbert was joking, but there's often truth in jest. And all joking aside, Colbert could be a formidable candidate: he is obviously well informed on the issues, as we see from his nightly monologue, has high name recognition, and hosts the most-watched late night show in America.

Colbert also has a few other key things needed to defeat Donald Trump. People running against him better be able to take a joke -- and more importantly, deliver a funny, cutting comeback. Look what happened during the GOP primaries as Donald Trump mocked opponents like Florida Senator Marco Rubio, calling him a ""choker,"" a ""lightweight,"" and a ""clown."" How did Rubio respond? He made an awkward joke about Donald Trump wetting his pants. Yikes, that was awful. In contrast, Stephen Colbert has shown us for years he has the skills to use comedy to undercut politicians and their arguments.

Another big plus for Colbert is that he's very effective at using Donald Trump's weapon of choice, Twitter, to troll him. For example, on Thursday, President Trump tweeted that he didn't personally record his conversation with former FBI Director James Comey, but added he didn't know if ""tapes"" existed. In response, Colbert tweeted a photo of himself in Russia dressed in a trenchcoat looking like a detective: "".@realDonaldTrump Don't worry, Mr. President. I'm in Russia. If the 'tapes' exist, I'll bring you back a copy!"" (That tweet went viral.)

Colbert also offers an intangible quality that makes him uniquely well-suited to take on Donald Trump: his jibes get under the President's skin. Just last month, after Colbert made a crude joke about Donald Trump's ""love"" for Vladimir Putin, President Trump (the guy who is supposed to be focused on things like keeping the nation safe, creating jobs, and the like) took time out of being President to lash out at Colbert, calling the late night host a ""no-talent guy"" and venting that without him, Colbert would be nothing in the ratings.

Did Colbert respond with an awkward, unfunny joke, like most politicians? Nope. Instead, he opened his show the following day perfectly, stating , ""The President of the United States has personally come after me and my show, and there's only one thing to say: yeah!"" Colbert then let out a self-congratulatory laugh while blowing kisses to the audience. Colbert added, ""Don't you know I've been trying for a year to get you (Donald Trump) to say my name? And you were very restrained -- admirably restrained -- but now you did it."" Colbert paused and then jubilantly added, ""I won!""

Perhaps those last two words are what a candidate Colbert would be uttering come election night in 2020. In fact, any of the late night comedians who focus on politics, such as Samantha Bee or Seth Meyers, could also be effective candidates against Donald Trump. (While John Oliver and Trevor Noah would also be great, unlike President Obama -- who President Trump falsely claimed was born outside the United States -- Noah and Oliver were actually born in foreign countries and are thus ineligible to run for President.)

  But Colbert is the best of the bunch. He is funny, well-informed, likable and thoughtful -- everything Donald Trump isn't. Plus, wouldn't it be great to have a President we laugh with, instead of at?"

http://cnn.com/2017/07/08/opinions/g20-summit-education-funding-opinion-gordon-brown-shakira/index.html,GORDON BROWN AND SHAKIRA: EDUCATION FINANCING AFTER G20,"Gordon Brown is the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Shakira Mebarak is an international artist and global education advocate. Both are members of the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity, known as the Education Commission . The opinions expressed in this commentary are theirs.

(CNN) If ours was a world where every child was in school and learning, then the two of us probably would have never met. But more than a decade ago, frustrated by education targets made by the international community set and missed, we came together to push back in a world where far too many children go without a quality education. It's up to all of us to make sure that children around the world have access to this essential right. Today, we finally have good news.

Included in the G20 Summit Leaders' Declaration is an agreement for more and better education financing through support for the International Finance Facility for education. With this declaration, world leaders are saying: Our sustainable development goal of an inclusive and quality education for all can be met. Now, with imaginative thinking and leadership, we can deliver.

The right to an education is imperative. Far scarier than the current reality of 263 million children out of school and not learning is the Education Commission's (an organization developing an investment case and financing pathway for achieving equal educational opportunity for children and youth) prediction that, by 2030, half a generation -- more than 800 million children -- will lack basic skills necessary to thrive in tomorrow's economy.

Recent years will one day be remembered as a time when, across 35 crisis-affected countries, it was more dangerous to be a child on the streets than a soldier in the trenches. Inaction, whether in Syria or South Sudan, suggests the world has become inured to the unending violations of children's rights impacting some 75 million children caught in the crossfire. Many of the children who flee conflict zones cannot even access the one thing that can make their lives better -- education. Without it, girls in particular will be victims of early marriage, trafficking, child labor and sexual discrimination.

One of us serves as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador, the other as a United Nations special envoy for global education. In these, and our shared capacities as members of the Education Commission, we know the power of an education. We will be forever changed by our meetings with child brides in India, young Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Turkey, and impoverished children in Colombia and across Latin America. All of these children told us that an education is the only force strong enough -- the only wire cutter sharp enough -- to escape cycles of suffering and division. And so coming out of the G20, the international community has, to draw on the old proverb, decided to light a candle rather than curse the darkness.

Since 2002, the share of education funding in total international aid has fallen from 13% to 10%. A painful global recession turned back the clock on national education budgets -- which is where most of the resources for education come from -- and slowed the positive momentum witnessed in the early 2000s. While the international community agreed to bold, new sustainable development goals in 2017 -- universal primary and secondary education by 2030 -- we have, until now, failed to find a way to finance them. There have been encouraging signs of progress thanks to Botswana, Vietnam, Ghana, Tanzania and others that have put education first, and through international alliances like the Global Partnership for Education, operating in the poorest countries, and the newly established Education Cannot Wait fund , supporting education in emergency situations. Still, a change is needed if ever we are to achieve education for all.

The G20's support for the proposed International Finance Facility for Education means new money tied to real results in children's lives. The facility offers a lifeline for many of the world's children who are out of school. This pact between countries that are willing to invest and reform, and an international community eager to take action, proves cooperation is alive and well. Through the Facility, more than $10 billion in new education funds could be donated by private and public donors and international banks made available -- helping to close the existing funding gap.

Education deserves nothing less than such a commitment. Delivering on that promise for all children is the civil rights struggle of our age. And it can be won, for history proves that what sometimes seems impossible can be made possible. In the 1960s, the world marched for civil rights. In the 1970s and 80s, people came together to boycott a South African regime and end the oppressive forces of apartheid. And, in the last two decades, the avenues to guarantee the rights of women, people with disabilities, and LGBT persons have been expanded. In all of these realms, there is still much work to be done. The battle to secure children's rights -- neglected for far too long -- deserves the same relentless commitment.

We can be the first generation in history where not just some children but every single child in the world is not exploited but educated. As parents, we know the power of learning and the hope that can be witnessed if this opportunity is seized. For one of us, an early start in schooling brought into focus the reality that so many go without their talents and potential developed. And for the other, growing up in Colombia and seeing the transformative power an education can have on communities in a conflict-ridden country -- from creating jobs to dispelling violence -- reinforced the need to deliver this most fundamental right.

The two of us were brought together years ago because we agreed that this was the fight of our lives. With time, this conviction has only grown stronger. Today, we celebrate progress toward this promise. Now comes the hardest part: delivering."

About 80 firefighters worked alongside police and other crews through the night.The dead were identified as an elderly resident and two families, one with children of elementary and high school age, and one with a grown son living at home.The cause of the collapse remained under investigation, but authorities said it may be linked to renovation work on the building, located along the Naples-Salerno railway line in the town of Torre Annunziata. Debris fell onto the rails, and the scenic line that connects Naples with the nearby Pompeii archaeological site and the scenic Amalfi coast remained closed.Witnesses said there was no explosion before the collapse but that a train had just passed by. The Italian railway said vibrations from the train have no impact on adjacent buildings because they are absorbed by ballast.Prosecutors were investigating possible charges.Carabinieri were the first to respond to the collapse at 6:30 a.m. as many residents still slept, digging by hand to find survivors. The work continued for hours by hand until heavier equipment arrived, while sniffer dogs checked for signs of life.""We intervened immediately,"" Carabinieri Marshall Francesco Murciano told Sky TG24.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-vote-idUSKBN19V29W,TRUMP'S ELECTION PANEL PUTS HOLD ON VOTER DATA REQUEST,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's commission to investigate possible election fraud on Monday put a freeze on its effort to collect sensitive voter data from states in the face of growing legal challenges. In an email, the panel's designated officer, Andrew Kossack, asked state elections officers to ""hold on submitting any data,"" the commission said in court filings.  Several state elections officials confirmed receiving a letter from the panel stating that it would provide further instructions after a federal judge had ruled on a complaint filed by a watchdog group, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), which is seeking a temporary restraining order. Earlier on Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, alleging violations of federal law requiring transparent government. The bipartisan panel, led by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, asked the 50 U.S. states for a host of voter data, including birth dates and the last four digits of voters' Social Security numbers.  Most U.S. states have rejected full compliance, which many called unnecessary and a violation of privacy.  This has been a misadventure from the get-go,"" Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin, who had refused to give the commission any data, said by phone. In Wisconsin, elections officials halted plans to inform the commission how it could purchase for $12,500 its public voter data, not including Social Security numbers or birth dates.  ""We're just putting everything on hold,"" said Reid Magney, spokesman for the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Arkansas, however, had already sent in a limited batch of publicly available data, according to the office of Secretary of State Mark Martin, In a court document, the government said it would not download the information from Arkansas and would instead delete it. Representatives for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.         The commission last week said it would meet on July 19 in Washington near the White House. On Monday, critics cheered the move and expressed hope the commission would permanently abandon efforts to collect voter data. ""The commission has effectively conceded,"" EPIC President Marc Rotenberg said by phone. State officials from both parties and election experts widely agree that voter fraud is rare. Civil rights groups called the commission a voter suppression tactic by Trump.  The Republican president created the panel in May following his claim, without evidence, that millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-banks-italy-idUSKBN19V1OR?il=0,ITALY'S BANK RESCUES RAISE ISSUE OF EU STATE AID RULE CHANGES: DIJSSELBLOEM,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The head of euro zone finance ministers said on Monday that Italy's winding-down in June of two banks from the Veneto region had raised the question of whether European Union rules on state aid should be changed. EU state aid rules for banks were revised in the wake of the 2010-2012 euro zone debt crisis and allow public support for lenders after shareholders and junior bondholders have contributed to the rescue.  The state aid rules are less strict than more recent banking rules, known as the bail-in, which dictate that senior bondholders and uninsured depositors must take losses before taxpayers' money can be used to help banks. ""The question is if the state aid rules, that apply in any case, should not be adjusted now,"" Jeroen Dijsselbloem told reporters in reply to a question on whether Italy's public rescue of Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza was in line with the spirit of EU banking rules. Arriving at a regular meeting of euro zone finance ministers in Brussels, Dijsselbloem said EU banking rules were respected by Italy, but that a discussion would be held at the Eurogroup meeting on possible changes to EU competition rules.  After the meeting, he said no joint conclusions were adopted by ministers but that discussions will continue on this issue. ""We need to make sure that even if other legal frameworks apply, the state aid rules should be to the same kind of level,"" Dijsselbloem said. EU rules are proposed by the executive European Commission and approved by EU states and the European Parliament. Italy used the state aid framework to wind down the Veneto banks because the small size of the lenders permitted it.   Arriving at the same meeting, the European Commission vice president in charge of the issue, Valdis Dombrovskis, said the EU executive ""at a certain stage"" will discuss whether state aid rules for banks need to be changed. But he stressed that there would be no proposal for the moment as possible side effects of amending the rules need to be carefully assessed. As he arrived at the meeting, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said Italy had ""done very well"" in handling problems with troubled banks and that its actions were a good basis for further improvements.

Northwest England's mountainous Lake District was among the new sites added to the list, the UK's first national park to become a World Heritage property.

""The combined work of nature and human activity has produced a harmonious landscape in which the mountains are mirrored in the lakes,"" says UNESCO's statement announcing the inscription.

India's walled city of Ahmedabad, founded by Sultan Ahmed Shah in the 15th century, was also added to the list, becoming the country's first city to get a UNESCO nod.

Located on the eastern bank of the Sabarmati river, it ""presents a rich architectural heritage from the sultanate period, notably the Bhadra citadel, the walls and gates of the Fort city and numerous mosques and tombs as well as important Hindu and Jain temples of later periods,"" says UNESCO's description of the city.

Now on the list: The English Lake District.

Two South America properties were added to the list, including Brazil's Valongo Wharf, an archeological site.

Located in central Rio de Janeiro, the wharf encompasses the entire Jornal do ComÃÂ©rcio Square and was built to receive enslaved Africans who began landing the South American continent from 1811.

""It is the most important physical trace of the arrival of African slaves on the American continent,"" says UNESCO.

UNESCO decisions draw protests

Controversial: The Cave of the Patriarchs, also known as the Ibrahimi Mosque.

This year's committee meeting wasn't without controversy. Israel has denounced UNESCO's decision to inscribe the old city of Hebron in the West Bank as a Palestinian World Heritage Site.

Israel accused UNESCO of making a politically motivated move, part of what it says is an attempt to deny the Jewish character and heritage of certain key sites in the Holy Land.

Meanwhile, UNESCO's decision to approve China's nomination of Hoh Xil, part of the high-altitude Tibetan plateau in Qinghai Province, has also drawn protests.

The International Campaign for Tibet says the nomination poses a threat to Tibetan nomads and their way of life.

""The Committee ignored the reality that Tibetans -- and nomads in particular -- are stewards of the landscape whose role is essential to sustaining the wildlife, the long-term health of the ecosystems, and the water resources that China and Asia depend upon,"" said Kai Mueller, Executive Director of the International Campaign for Tibet, in a statement.

Here's this year's list of newly inscribed sites, several of which can be viewed in the above gallery:

Turkey: Aphrodisias, archeological site and marble quarries

Eritrea: Asmara, modernist city of Africa

Russia: Assumption Cathedral and Monastery of Sviyazhsk

Germany: Caves and ice age art in the Swabian Jura

Palestinian territories: Hebron/Al-Khalil Old Town

Iran: Historic city of Yazd

Denmark: Kujataa Greenland, sub-arctic farming landscape

China: Kulangsu, historic international settlement

Angola: Mbanza Kongo, political and spiritual capital of the Kingdom of Kongo

Japan: Sacred Island of Okinoshima

France: TaputapuÃÂtea, center of the ""Polynesian Triangle""

Poland: Tarnowskie GÃÂ³ry, lead-silver-zinc mine

Cambodia: Sambor Prei Kuk temple zone

United Kingdom: English Lake District

Brazil: Valongo Wharf, archeological site

Croatia, Italy, Montenegro: Venetian Works of Defense

South Africa: Khomani Cultural Landscape

Mongolia, Russia: Landscapes of Dauria

Argentina: Los Alerces National Park

China: Qinghai Hoh Xil, world's highest and largest plateau

India: Historic city of Ahmedabad























1 / 12 12 incredible UNESCO sites you've probably never heard of: Surrounded by forests of beech, fir and spruce, a multi-level system of 16 lakes spills into waterfalls and pools in Croatia's Plitvice Lakes National Park. The lakes are known for their distinctive colors, which can be turquoise, green, blue or gray. No swimming is allowed in the pristine pools.

Places of 'outstanding universal value'

The United Nations' World Heritage Committee, made up of representatives from 21 countries, meets annually to vote natural, cultural and sites of mixed significance around the world to its prestigious preservation list, which includes places of ""outstanding universal value.""

The inscribed sites must meet at least one of 10 criteria such as ""representing a masterpiece of human creative genius,"" containing ""exceptional natural beauty"" or being an outstanding example of a traditional human settlement.

UNESCO has been adding sites to the World Heritage List since 1978.

In the travel world, being able to add the words ""UNESCO World Heritage Site"" to destination marketing materials is the equivalent of striking tourism gold, bringing fame and cultural cachet as well as resources for sites in need of restoration and protection.

As a result, nations often spend years developing pitches for inclusion on the list and must convince the UNESCO committee they will protect their sites and support them financially."

Gilles Muller shocked the tennis world by beating an in-form Rafael Nadal in the round of 16 at the 2017 Wimbledon Championships on Monday, defeating the two-time champion 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 4-6, 15-13 to reach the quarter-finals.

Nadal's enthralling run of form in 2017 came to a screeching halt due to a ferocious performance from his Luxembourger foe, who survived a tug-of-war that lasted four hours and 50 minutes to clinch just his second major quarter-final.

Marin Cilic awaits Muller in the next round after he trounced Nadal's Spanish compatriot Roberto Bautista Agut, 6-2, 6-2, 6-2, on Manic Monday.

Nadal maintained his composure even after such an agonising defeat:

Two left-handed contenders of this calibre were always going to make for an intriguing bout, and the pair lived up to expectations with a roller-coaster duel on Court No. 1.

Nadal could have been forgiven for being caught somewhat off guard in the first set, where Muller's aggression from the serve and follow-up play kept things tight as the latter carved out an early a 3-2 advantage.

That approach helped Muller notch the first (and only) break of the first set to lead 4-2 thanks to Nadal hitting the net on a stern return. Both players served out the remainder of their points to mark a surprisingly clean set for Muller, who ended a substantial Nadal streak, per tennis writer Jose Morgado:

The ensuing second set was over in a flash, as during the opening seven games, the loser managed to get more than one point on the board only twice, a sign of how vital the service battle had become.

Nadal avoided any unforced errors in the first set but changed for the worse in the second, as he surrendered four, per the IBM Slamtracker.

One of those again happened to come at a potentially decisive moment, when his sliced return skidded into the net to seal another break in Muller's favour to lead 5-4, although tennis reporter David Law wasn't all surprised:

The Nadal that returned to play in the third set was different than the one witnessed up to that point in the matchÃ¢ÂÂor at the very least, Muller's defiance had considerably lessened during the interval.

Nadal's trusty left hand helped him win to love in the opener and defend his own serve with relative ease while breaking Muller to lead 3-1 and then 4-1, although Stuart Fraser of The Times indicated the odds were still against him:

That three-game streak ignited a fire in Nadal that burned until the end of the third set, and it was the Spaniard who this time came away with the smash-and-grab, albeit not before Muller fended off two set points.

One came under the impression Nadal was far more likely to snatch the win the longer their clash raged on, and again he picked his moments wisely in the fourth, breaking Muller in near-identical fashion to the previous set.

While Nadal failed to concede more than one point in any of his five services games during the set, a double-fault from Muller in the fifth gave Nadal the opening he needed to put together a three-game spree once again.

The 31-year-old drew level at two sets each after seemingly draining Muller of all fortitude on his return, but a steelier response emerged from Luxembourg's finest in the decider as Match of the Day's Gary Lineker hailed the favourite's revival:

Despite shifting the momentum in his favour, Nadal continued to see resistance from a relentless Muller, whose serve gave him a major advantage in the short rallies, while his foe excelled in longer exchanges.

Nadal's return handed Muller some trouble, and although the same couldn't always be said vice versa, the underdog nevertheless kept things level at 4-4 without having to face deuce in the fifth set until that point.

The 6'4"" dark horse forced two match points out of his foe in the 10th game before Nadal responded with resolve to tie matters up at five games apiece. But it wasn't long before Muller was back on the baseline, and sure enough, he served to love for the second game in succession.

The balance of the points meant the Spaniard would be under the screw for the remainder of their clash, per Ben Rothenberg of the New York Times:

Muller continued to stand the test of an enemy who would overwhelm others but struggled to keep up with his serve. The dark horse clinched advantage before taking the game to lead, with aces still playing a factor in his rise, as tennis writer Christopher Clarey noted:

But Nadal was even keeping up in that regard and boasted 20 aces to his opponent's 24 as they raged into the 14th game of their meetingÃ¢ÂÂnot to mention the second hour of their fifth setÃ¢ÂÂbefore Muller gleaned the slightest of cushions at 8-7.

The tug of war broke the four-hour mark as the pair dragged each other into a 20th game with Muller holding a 10-9 lead. At that point, Nadal had missed four break-point opportunities:

The Wimbledon crowd rallied around Nadal with every point he claimed, capitalising on any Muller error to eventually draw 13-13. Muller had found at least some answer to Nadal's serve, and to an extent, vice versa.

Muller showed great calm with a backhand to again go ahead at 14-13, but his critical piece of composure came a game later, when he opened up two match points and watched Nadal's forehand sail long to settle the match.

The left-handed Muller handed Nadal a tough draw in the fourth round, although Cilic will be a difficult foe to down in his own respect, particularly with Muller fresh off a match that lasted close to five hours.

Nadal has not advanced past the round of 16 at Wimbledon since 2011, when he lost in the finals to Novak Djokovic."
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-peru-ecuador-idUSKBN19V297?il=0,PERU RECALLS AMBASSADOR FROM ECUADOR IN ROW OVER BORDER WALL,"LIMA (Reuters) - Peru has recalled its ambassador to Ecuador after Quito refused to stop building a wall along a canal separating the two, Peru's Foreign Affairs Ministry said on Monday as both countries expressed concern over flood risks. Peru said construction of the concrete wall, part of an urban revival project, violates a peace treaty signed by both countries because it comes too close to a canal in populated areas along the Zarumilla River, which forms part of the border for the two countries. Ecuador said it lamented Peru's decision to recall its ambassador and said Peru had not responded to its request last week to discuss the dispute in a high-level meeting. ""Ecuador believes that dialogue is the valid mechanism to overcome any divergence between sister countries, and therefore reiterates its willingness and openness to address these issues immediately,"" the country's Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement. The dispute marks a rough start to bilateral relations between Ecuador and Peru under centrist Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski and Ecuador's socialist President Lenin Moreno, both of whom took office in the past year. The dispute underscores both countries' sensitivity to the kind of heavy flooding in the border region that could become more extreme with climate change. Ecuador has said the wall would help control flooding that affects border towns every year but Peru said it could disrupt the flow of water in the canal and raise flood risks for Peruvians. Peru had extreme flooding earlier this year after a sudden warming of Pacific waters off its coast triggered some of the nation's heaviest rains in decades. More than 150 people died and reconstruction efforts could cost up to $9 billion, according to the government. Peru also has said the wall would hurt efforts to remove bureaucratic barriers at the border. In the 1990s, territorial disputes led to a three-year war between the two countries, which share a 1,529 kilometer-long (950 miles) border. Cross-border trade remains fluid, but passage of contraband is common. Reporting by Mitra Taj in Lima and Alexandra Valencia in Quito; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Bill Trott"
http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/05/health/hunter-gatherer-diet-tanzania-the-conversation/index.html,WHAT A HUNTER-GATHERER DIET DOES TO THE BODY,"Tim Spector is professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation .

(CNN) Mounting evidence suggests that the richer and more diverse the community of microbes in your gut the lower your risk of disease. Diet is key to maintaining diversity and was strikingly demonstrated when an undergrad student went on a McDonald's diet for ten days and after just four days experienced a significant drop in the number of beneficial microbes.

Your gut microbiome is a vast community of trillions of bacteria that has a major influence on your metabolism, immune system and mood. These bacteria and fungi inhabit every nook and cranny of your gastrointestinal tract, with most of this 1kg to 2kg ""microbe organ"" sited in your colon (the main bit of your large intestine).

We tend to see the biggest diet-related shifts in microbes in people who are unhealthy with a low-diversity unstable microbiome. What we didn't know is whether a healthy stable gut microbiome could be improved in just a few days. The chance to test this in an unusual way came when my colleague Jeff Leach invited me on a field trip to Tanzania, where he has been living and working among the Hadza, one of the last remaining hunter-gatherer groups in all of Africa.

My microbiome is pretty healthy nowadays and, among the first hundred samples we tested as part of the MapMyGut project, I had the best gut diversity -- our best overall measure of gut health, reflecting the number and richness of different species. High diversity is associated with a low risk of obesity and many diseases. The Hadza have a diversity that is one of the richest on the planet

The research plan was devised by Jeff who suggested I should have an intensive three days of eating like a hunter gatherer during my stay at his research camp. I would measure my gut microbes before heading to Tanzania, during my stay with the Hadza, and after my return to the UK. I was also not allowed to wash or use alcohol swabs and I was expected to hunt and forage with the Hadza as much as possible -- including coming in contact with the odd Hadza baby and baboon poo lying about.

To help us record the trip I was accompanied by Dan Saladino, the intrepid presenter and producer of BBC Radio 4's The Food Programme , who was preparing a Hadza microbe special.

After a long tiring flight to Mount Kilimanjaro Airport in Tanzania, we stayed overnight in Arusha, a city in the north of the country. Before setting off the next morning, I produced my baseline poo sample.

After an eight-hour journey in a Land Rover over bumpy tracks, we arrived. Jeff beckoned us to the top of a huge rock to witness the most amazing sunset over Lake Eyasi. Here, within a stones throw of the famous fossil site of Olduvai Gorge and with the stunning plains of the Serengeti in the distance, Jeff explained that we were never going to be closer to home as a member of the genus Homo, than where we were standing at that moment.

The million-year-old diet

The Hadza seek out the same animals and plants that humans have hunted and gathered for millions of years. Importantly, the human-microbe tango that played out here for aeons probably shaped aspects of our immune system and made us who we are today. The significance of being in Hadza-land was not lost on me.

Unlike the Hadza, who sleep around the fire or in grass huts, I was given a tent and told to zip it up tight as there were scorpions and snakes about. I had to be careful where I stepped if I needed a nocturnal pee. After an interesting but restless night's sleep, a large pile of baobab pods had been collected for my breakfast.

At the center of celebrations is Gerewol, a male beauty contest and courtship ritual. Young men -- traditionally herdsmen -- wear full makeup, jewelry and their finest clothes and stand in line to await inspection by female onlookers. White teeth and white eyes are highly prized, so participants will grin broadly and pull all manner of expressions in the hope of attracting attention. It's flirtation en masse, in the hope of winning a night of passion with one of the judges. Hide Caption 1 of 12 Photos: Mursi, lip plates Ã¢ÂÂ

They are one of the few tribes that continue the practice in East Africa, but archaeologists have discovered lip plates in the region stretching back 30,000 years, says anthropologist Dr Jerome Lewis of University College London. ""It's a body modification that people find beautiful,"" he says. ""It's also very striking and a distinctive way of marking your difference from other people around you.""The bottom lip is pierced with a wooden peg inserted, which is replaced with larger pegs thereafter.

It's the result of otjize, a paste of butter, fat and red ocher, applied daily to their hair and skin. It was once speculated that the otjize served as a form of sun protection and to ward off insects, however the women say it's purely for aesthetic reasons -- which makes sense, given that Himba men don't take part in the practice.

It's a coming of age ceremony, and only when the participant has traversed the bull run four times will he be allowed to marry. Slip and you risk a hard fall: ""Because it's a manhood initiation ritual, [failure] is likely to affect the perception of someone's manhood and that of course can have all sorts of dire consequence,"" adds Dr Lewis.

The youths, known as abakhwetha, are first circumcised without anesthetic, before being sent away from their village and into the bush, with minimal supplies and wrapped in a blanket. Wearing white clay on their faces, initiates will fend for themselves for up to two months, living in a structure built by the village's adult community specifically for Ulwaluko. Upon their return they are no longer referred to as ""boy"" and receive a new blanket. The initiation has not been without its criticisms, due to complications and malpractice surrounding the circumcision process. Hide Caption 5 of 12 Photos: Chewa, matriarchy Ã¢ÂÂ



One thing Chewa women are shut out of is the Women of the Chewa tribe may not be quite on equal footing as men, but they do hold the key to one thing: inheritance. Descent and succession for the Bantu-speaking tribe, spread across Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique, is matrilineal, with property and land inherited from their mothers. ""Although inheritance passes down the female line, which definitely gives women more power in society, it's still male-dominated and patriarchal in the sense that men are still at the apex of power,"" explains Lewis. ""People have an assumption that matrilineal societies are somehow favorable to women -- and they are certainly more favorable than some of the extreme patrilineal societies -- but they're not societies that give women equal power.""One thing Chewa women are shut out of is the Nyau brotherhood (pictured), a secretive society who can channel spirits and performs a ritual dance called Gule Wamkulu around harvest and at weddings and funeral. Hide Caption 6 of 12 Photos: Maasai, spitting Ã¢ÂÂ Spittle is an essential part of life for the Maasai of East Africa, as it acts as a blessing. ""People have different views about where the power and essence of somebody resides,"" explains Lewis. For some, ""spit represents an essence of you as a person.""



To spit is ""a way of blessing people by giving something of yourself; your own power to someone else."" It starts at an early age, when newborn babies are spat on to wish them a good life. ""If you leave a place, elders will come and spit on your head in order to bless your departure, and that whatever you do you're safe and kept well,"" adds Lewis. Hide Caption 7 of 12 Photos: San, healing dance Ã¢ÂÂ



Lewis says that this tradition is under threat: ""In some places in southern Africa the San now perform their traditional culture exclusively for tourists, because they've been forced out of all their territories as hunter-gatherers by conservationist organizations. This means that by extension... these performances are not the original initiations but a facsimile of them."" The San of South Africa, Botswana, Angola and Namibia are, according to some researchers, the world's oldest people . Their hunter-gatherer culture stretches back tens of thousands of years, and integral to it is the trance dance, also known as the healing dance. Historically an all-night affair, the practice brings the whole community together, led by healers and elders dancing around a fire, chanting and breathing deeply until they induce a trance state. It offers the chance to commune with ancestral spirits of the departed and for healers, cure sickness within other dancers.Lewis says that this tradition is under threat: ""In some places in southern Africa the San now perform their traditional culture exclusively for tourists, because they've been forced out of all their territories as hunter-gatherers by conservationist organizations. This means that by extension... these performances are not the original initiations but a facsimile of them."" Hide Caption 8 of 12 Photos: Bantu-speaking tribes, lobola Ã¢ÂÂ



""It's the cause of much conflict,"" says Lewis, ""because in order for a man to get married he must provide often quite a substantial head of cattle, and so he's in indentured labor to his father until the herd he's caring for is big enough."" In societies that are cattle based, men tend to marry in their mid-forties, he adds, explaining that ""there's always a backlog of women who are available but unable to marry"" because men of a similar age have not yet raised the required bridalwealth. A feature of marital affairs for many Bantu-speaking tribes in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Swaziland, lobola is practiced by, among others, Zulus (pictured). Lobola is also referred to as ""bridalwealth"", with the prospective groom's family negotiating with the bride's for her hand in marriage. The dowry comes in many forms, including money, but some choose cattle. There were reports in 1998 that Nelson Mandela (of Thembu lineage) paid the marital lobola of 60 cows to the family of new wife Graca Machel.""It's the cause of much conflict,"" says Lewis, ""because in order for a man to get married he must provide often quite a substantial head of cattle, and so he's in indentured labor to his father until the herd he's caring for is big enough.""

The tangelmust, a wrapped headdress up to eight meters in length, is ubiquitous among the ""blue men of the desert."" The name does not allude to the muslin headdress, dyed with indigo, but rather because the dye gradually leeches out into the skin of the wearer. Tuaregs use the tangelmust for practical reasons: it protects from the sun and sand, but men will still wear them at night, and even during meals. Men cover their faces with the tangelmust in front of strangers and women, while women are free to show their face.

Each clan will then present an unmarried male to compete for the title of fattest man -- and with the glory, the greater chance of finding a wife.

Rubbish of all manner, but particularly bottle tops, have begun to be recycled by Dassanech women, who weave the metal caps into vibrant jangly headdresses. Other women have adapted broken watches and trinkets for similar purposes -- and a sure fire way of getting yourself noticed. Hide Caption 12 of 12

The baobab fruit is the staple of the Hadza diet, packed with vitamins, fat in the seeds, and, of course, significant amounts of fibre. We were surrounded by baobab trees stretching in the distance as far as I could see. Baobab fruit have a hard coconut-like shell that cracks easily to reveal a chalky flesh around a large, fat-rich seed. The high levels of vitamin C provided an unexpected citrus tang.

The Hadza mixed the chalky bits with water and whisked it vigorously for two to three minutes with a stick until it was a thick, milky porridge that was filtered -- somewhat -- into a mug for my breakfast. It was surprisingly pleasant and refreshing. As I wasn't sure what else I would be eating on my first day, I drank two mugs and suddenly felt very full.

My next snacks were the wild berries on many of the trees surrounding the camp -- the commonest were small Kongorobi berries. These refreshing and slightly sweet berries have 20 times the fibre and polyphenols compared with cultivated berries -- powerful fuel for my gut microbiome. I had a late lunch of a few high-fibre tubers dug up with a sharp stick by the female foragers and tossed on the fire. These were more effort to eat - like tough, earthy celery. I didn't go for seconds or feel hungry, probably because of my high-fibre breakfast. No one seemed concerned about dinner.

A few hours later we were asked to join a hunting party to track down porcupine -- a rare delicacy. Even Jeff hadn't tasted this creature in his four years of field work.

Two 20kg nocturnal porcupines had been tracked to their tunnel system in a termite mound. After several hours of digging and tunnelling -- carefully avoiding the razor-sharp spines -- two porcupines were eventually speared and thrown to the surface. A fire was lit. The spines, skin and valuable organs were expertly dissected and the heart, lung and liver cooked and eaten straight away.

The rest of the fatty carcass was taken back to camp for communal eating. It tasted much like suckling pig. We had a similar menu the next two days, with the main dishes including hyrax -- a strange furry guinea-pig-like hoofed animal, weighing about 4kg -- a relative of the elephant, of all creatures.

Harvested high from a baobab tree, our dessert was the best golden orange honey I could ever imagine -- with the bonus of honeycomb full of fat and protein from the larvae. The combination of fat and sugars made our dessert the most energy-dense food found anywhere in nature and may have competed with fire in terms of its evolutionary importance.

In Hadza-land nothing is wasted or killed unnecessarily, but they eat an amazing variety of plant and animal species (around 600, most of which are birds) compared with us in the West. My other lasting impression was how little time they spent getting food. It appeared as though it took just a few hours a day -- as simple as going round a large supermarket. Any direction you walked there was food -- above, on and below ground.

Massive increase in microbiome diversity

Twenty-four hours later Dan and I were back in London, him with his precious audio tapes and me with my cherished poo samples. After producing a few more, I sent them to the lab for testing.

The results showed clear differences between my starting sample and after three days of my forager diet. The good news was my gut microbal diversity increased a stunning 20%, including some totally novel African microbes, such as those of the phylum Synergistetes."
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-07/five-signs-point-to-skill-shortages-in-the-united-states,FIVE SIGNS POINT TO SKILL SHORTAGES IN THE UNITED STATES,"Is there a skills shortage in the U.S.? Businesses complain that they can't find workers with the skills they need (and recruiters are in great demand), but workers and their advocates respond that employers simply aren't willing to pay enough.  A new report tries to get to the bottom of this by combining insights from five sources of data, including ones that employers like to cite and ones that workers use to make their case. Its conclusion: Yes, there are skill shortages. But not everywhere. While skill shortages are ""most dire"" in health care, there are no national shortages at all in several other sectors, including leisure and hospitality.The study is by Third Way, a think tank that identifies itself as centrist. Its author is Rachael Stephens, who has a master's degree in public policy from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and wrote the report while working as an economics fellow at Third Way. The middle-of-the-road conclusion on the existence of skills shortages--kind of yes, kind of no--grew out of Stephens's decision to consult multiple, sometimes-conflicting data sources. ""While any one type of data might have a shortcoming, when we look at the data sets holistically, we see patterns emerging,"" she said in an interview on July 5, her last day at Third Way.In health care and social assistance, for example, the job-filling rate is low, which seems to indicate that employers can't find the nurses, aides, and other workers they need. On the other hand, wage growth has been modest, which seems to indicate the opposite--that employers are getting the people they need without resorting to big pay raises.To resolve the contradiction between job-filling data and pay data in health care, the report looks at three other indicators. One, the supply of people in the U.S. who have the education or credentials that the sector requires, points to a ""moderate gap or shortage."" Two other measuresemployer surveys and analyses by state governmentspoint to a ""significant gap or shortage.""Putting all five measures together, the report rates the skills shortage in health care as dire (and likely to get worse as society ages). Still, what about the fact that pay growth has been so modest? Not a reliable indicator in this case, Stephens decided. ""Wages in the health care sector are largely controlled by public health care funding and insurance markets,"" the report notes. ""Thus, we cant necessarily expect wages to behave the same way we would in most labor markets.""The indicators are flipped in the sector with the second-worst skill shortages, professional and business services. There, the job-fill rate isn't too bad, but wage growth has been exceptionally strong, Stephens found. Tech seems to be the most problematic corner of the professional and business services sector. State-level analyses helped her reach that conclusion. ""In their 2016 reports to the U.S. Department of Labor, seven of the nine states with high-quality data (California, Colorado, Missouri, New York, Rhode Island, Washington, and Connecticut) all reported serious concern about filling tech jobs over the next few years,"" she wrote.In education, which has the third-worst problem, it's STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) where qualifications tend to be lacking, the study finds. This colorful table summarizes the data, sector by sector. As a bonus, the Third Way report sorts out three terms that tend to get used interchangeably (including by me). Skill gaps exist when the training or education for a job is inadequate to the job's demands. A skills shortage ""is more commonly what we're really talking about,"" the report says; it's when training and education are adequate, but there simply aren't enough people who have it. And a skills mismatch is when workers are skilled but in the wrong things: Some sectors have an oversupply of skilled labor, while others suffer a deficit. Will these careful distinctions catch on? Hard to saythe Third Way report itself sometimes uses ""gap"" and ""shortage"" interchangeably."
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-idUSKBN19U08D?il=0,U.S.-RUSSIAN CEASEFIRE DEAL HOLDING IN SOUTHWEST SYRIA,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - A U.S.-Russian brokered ceasefire for southwest Syria held through the day, a monitor and rebels said on Sunday, in the first peacemaking effort of the war by the U.S. government under President Donald Trump.  The United States, Russia and Jordan reached the ""de-escalation agreement,"" which appeared to give Trump a diplomatic achievement at his first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Germany this week.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said ""calm prevailed"" in the southwest since the truce began at noon (0900 GMT) on Sunday despite minor violations.  Combatants briefly exchanged fire in Deraa province and in Quneitra around midnight, but this ""did not threaten the ceasefire,"" said Observatory Director Rami Abdulrahman.     Major Issam al Rayes, spokesman of the Southern Front coalition of Western-backed rebel groups, said ""a cautious calm"" continued into the evening. ""The situation is relatively calm,"" Suhaib al-Ruhail, a spokesman for the Alwiyat al-Furqan faction in Quneitra, said earlier.  Another rebel official, in Deraa city, said there had been no significant fighting. It was quiet on the main Manshiya front near the border with Jordan, which he said had been the site of some of the heaviest army bombing in recent weeks. ""Syrian ceasefire seems to be holding ... Good!"" Trump tweeted on Sunday.  A Syrian official indicated that Damascus approved of the ceasefire deal, describing the government's silence over it as a ""sign of satisfaction."" ""We welcome any step that would cease the fire and pave the way for peaceful solutions,"" the government official told Reuters. A witness in Deraa said he had not seen warplanes in the sky or heard any fighting since noon. ""We negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives,"" Trump said in an earlier tweet on Sunday. ""Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!"" A senior U.S. State Department official involved in the talks said further discussions would be necessary to decide crucial aspects of the agreement, including who will monitor its enforcement. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the truce included ""securing humanitarian access and setting up contacts between the opposition in the region and a monitoring center that is being established in Jordan's capital."" Ahead of U.N.-based peace talks set to open on Monday, a spokesman for the opposition delegation said in Geneva the deal showed a ""serious international effort to bring peace."" ""Russia has been waiting for an American strategy to crystallize vis-a-vis Syria,"" said Yahya al-Aridi. ""And we believe this is quite serious in part from the United States to broker such a ceasefire, and we want it to be extended to other parts of Syria, to all of it."" Several ceasefires have crumbled, however, since the onset of the conflict. With the help of Russian air power and Iranian-backed militias, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has put rebels at a disadvantage over the past year. The wide array of mostly Sunni rebels include jihadist factions and other groups supported by Turkey, the United States and Gulf monarchies. Earlier talks between the United States and Russia about a ""de-escalation zone"" in southwest Syria covered Deraa province on the border with Jordan, nearby Sweida and Quneitra, which borders the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Deraa and Quneitra are home to tens of thousands of people and form a center of the insurgency south of the Syrian capital, Damascus. Rebels said intense air strikes had pounded Deraa's opposition territory in recent weeks.  The multi-sided Syrian conflict, which grew out of popular protests against Assad's rule in 2011, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and created the world's worst refugee crisis.

http://cnn.com/2017/07/07/opinions/helium-crisis-qatar-opinion-lincoln/index.html,HELIUM SHUTOFF IS SIDE EFFECT OF QATAR CRISIS (OPINION),"(CNN) The recent diplomatic dustup between Qatar and many other Gulf nations caused some nervousness for some of the world's most cutting edge scientists.

Among recalled ambassadors, closed borders and massive disruptions on travel and shipping, the diplomatic crisis highlighted the world's vulnerability to cutoffs in the supply of helium, since Qatar is the world's second-biggest producer of the vital substance, after the United States. Although the helium aspect of this diplomatic imbroglio has been resolved, it highlights the way in which international diplomacy can impact scientific research.

While most people might think of helium as simply being the gas that is used for balloons at children's birthday parties, it is actually a critical ingredient for some of the highest technologies on Earth.

It is used in cryogenic environments, like the operation of medical MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectrometers. It is used to purge and pressurize containers made of materials that cannot withstand chemical interactions.

It is used to provide controlled environments for the manufacture of solid-state computer chips. And it is used in tungsten gas welding for such metals as aluminum and copper, which would experience much weaker welds if they were contaminated by exposure to oxygen.

Helium is chemically inert and unique in its ability to remain liquid at temperatures below -450 F (-269 C) . It is found in air at low concentrations (about five parts per million) -- a concentration that does not economically allow for easy extraction.

In fact, helium is mostly obtained from natural gas deposits, like the South Pars/North Dome field, which is a natural gas condensate field shared by Iran and Qatar . Qatar stopped helium production on June 13 and only resumed operations on July 2. Had production not been resumed, the impact on scientific research could have been quite worrisome.

Helium is produced in radioactive alpha decay of minerals bearing either uranium or thorium, both of which are radioactive elements. Alpha decay is the emission of the nucleus of a helium atom. The same sort of geological processes that trap natural gas underground will also trap helium. The concentrations of helium in natural gas deposits vary widely, ranging from a few parts per million to as much as 7% at a small gas field located in New Mexico.

Qatar, with an area smaller than that of Connecticut, produces 25% of the world's helium and the recent diplomatic crisis strongly reduced its ability to ship this valuable commodity.

While the country can still ship natural gas via special facilities near Ras Laffan Industrial City in the north part of the country, helium is normally shipped overland through Saudi Arabia to the Jebel Ali port in the United Arab Emirates. With this shipping route blocked, the helium liquefication facilities inside Qatar were effectively shut down on June 13.

The necessary helium shipping containers are essentially very large thermos bottles, which eventually warm up when they are emptied. Since the containers were located at the customer's site and not quickly returned to the producer's facility, they warmed and were easily contaminated with air. At liquid helium temperatures, more common gasses are frozen solid; thus a small contamination by ordinary air can form solid blockages in helium transfer pipes. Restarting the cooling plant and reconditioning shipping containers is a very delicate and time-consuming business.

The world's scientific and technical community needs reliable helium supplies and each facility usually stores locally only a few weeks' worth of liquid helium consumption. However, once their reserves are depleted, they become very concerned about how long a reduction in production caused by disruptions like this blockade of Qatar is going to last.

When the helium supply becomes very scarce, this hits medical and scientific users particularly hard. Helium rationing has no system for prioritization; medical facilities do not get special access to the remaining reserves. What drives the distribution in a rationing environment is individual contracts. Previous helium production reductions saw some facilities having their supply reduced by half

The vulnerability of the world's helium supply is not a new thing. The United States formed an enormous helium reserve in 1925 just outside Amarillo, Texas, in part to ward off situations exactly like those caused by the Qatar blockade. However, in 1996, financial and political pressures led the US government to direct that the helium reserve be sold on the open market by 2006. The reduction of the reserve led to market forces driving the prices of this critical element, further leading to periodic shortages for the scientific community.

So, what should we do to avert future crises like that posed by the Qatar blockade? The first is to continue to further develop existing helium recapture technologies . Although these technologies exist, many existing facilities simply use helium to cool something or as part of their production process and then vent the helium gas to the atmosphere.

Helium's inertness makes this safe, but it is wasteful. If more companies and laboratories would capture the gas and liquefy it, they could recapture the cost of the capture facilities in just a few years. It would also guard against vulnerabilities to shortages caused by geopolitical problems like the Qatar diplomatic crisis.

And, although the world's helium reserves have not been depleted, it is a nonrenewable resource. When it's gone, it's gone. That's true of many substances, but with helium, things are different. There is no known substance that can replace it."

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fiatchrysler-emissions-idUSKBN19V28X?il=0,U.S. JUDGE TO NAME FEINBERG AS FIAT CHRYSLER DIESEL SETTLEMENT MASTER,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge overseeing lawsuits against Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) over its alleged excess diesel emissions said he intends to name well-known compensation expert Ken Feinberg to try to reach a settlement. Feinberg has overseen compensation funds for the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, General Motors (GM.N) ignition switch victims and the fallout from the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion (BP.L). He also worked as an consultant to Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) on a compensation program stemming from its massive diesel emissions cheating scandal. Federal judge Edward Chen in San Francisco said in an order issued last week that ""there is a pressing need to determine if all or some of the pending matters can be resolved by the parties sooner rather than later."" He gave all sides until Wednesday to file objections to naming Feinberg as settlement master. Feinberg declined to comment Monday. In May, the U.S. Justice Department sued Fiat Chrysler, accusing it of illegally using software that led to excess emissions in nearly 104,000 diesel vehicles sold since 2014. A lawyer for Fiat Chrysler, Robert Giuffra, said last month the company is optimistic regulators will approve a proposed software update as part of certifying 2017 diesel models to allow them to go on sale. The same updated software would then be used to address any excess diesel emission issues in  vehicles from the 2014-2016 model years already on the road.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board accused Fiat Chrysler in January of using undisclosed software to allow excess diesel emissions, which the government labeled a ""defeat device."" They are both still reviewing the proposed fix. Last month, Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said he was ""confident of the fact that there was no intention on our part to set up a defeat device that was even remotely similar to what (Volkswagen) had in their cars."" The Justice Department also has a separate criminal probe into the matter. Feinberg was among the candidates proposed as a possible settlement master by both Fiat Chrysler and Elizabeth Cabraser, the lead lawyer for owners and dealers suing the company.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-whole-foods-m-a-amazon-com-idUSKBN19S1XV,"AMAZON CORNERED WHOLE FOODS INTO NOT SEEKING MORE BIDS, FILING SHOWS","(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) told Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) it would not engage in a sale process for the U.S. grocer that involved other bidders, a regulatory filing showed on Friday, shedding new light on the $13.7 billion acquisition. The previously undisclosed details on the negotiations show how Amazon used its deep pockets and brand as leverage to convince Whole Foods to accept a sale process that would not result in a bidding war. Whole Food shares traded above Amazon's $42-per-share deal price for the first few days after the agreement was announced on June 16, on investor expectations of a higher bid. They have since traded slightly below that price, as such hopes dampened. The regulatory filing shows that Whole Foods agreed to forgo an auction process after it received expressions of interest from two other companies and four private equity firms. None of these parties are identified by name. The filing refers to a 'company X,' which proposed a merger of equals that valued Whole Foods at between $35 and $40 per share. U.S. supermarket chain owner Albertsons LLC is company X, a source familiar with the matter said. Albertsons did not respond to a request for comment. Nevertheless, Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods agreed not to pursue this, or solicit any other bids, in part because Amazon was ""very sensitive with respect to confidentiality"" and did not want to compete in a broader sale process, the filing said.  Whole Foods said in the filing it sought $45 per share from Amazon but settled for $42 per share, which the ecommerce giant called its ""best and final offer."" Amazon had offered $41 in May, according to the filing. Amazon had also told Whole Foods it was considering other opportunities in case its final offer was turned down. The filing added that Amazon reserved the right to terminate the talks if there was any leak or rumor of its interest in Whole Foods.  The other company that expressed interest in Whole Foods, referred to in the filing as 'company Y,' had an interest in exploring a commercial relationship, such as a supply arrangement, and did not discuss any merger or acquisition, according to the filing. Whole Foods' management, under pressure from activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC to explore a sale of the company, decided not to solicit proposals from the four private equity firms as the price proposed by Amazon likely exceeded the amount a private equity buyer could be expected to pay, according to the filing.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-healthcare-idUSKBN19V0YP,HEALTHCARE DISAGREEMENTS ROIL U.S. SENATE REPUBLICANS,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican senators returned to Washington on Monday following a 10-day holiday recess still at odds with one another over legislation President Donald Trump wants passed to repeal major portions of Obamacare. With only three weeks left before a summer recess scheduled to stretch until Sept. 5, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared determined to keep trying to find agreement on a partisan, all-Republican bill. If he cannot, he will be faced with giving up on a seven-year Republican promise to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare - and possibly turning to Democrats for help in fixing problems with U.S. health insurance markets. The Republican legislation would phase out the Obamacare expansion of Medicaid health insurance for the poor and disabled, sharply cut federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025, repeal most of Obamacare's taxes, end a penalty on Americans who do not obtain insurance and overhaul Obamacare's subsidies to help people buy insurance with tax credits. Democrats call the Republican legislation a giveaway to the rich that would hurt millions of the most vulnerable Americans. Since the start of 2017, when they took control of the White House, Republicans who also control Congress have been struggling over how to replace former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature legislation - which they see as  government intrusion - with less comprehensive federal healthcare provisions. Conservative Republican Senator Ted Cruz favors offering a choice of cheaper healthcare plans that would not have to meet minimum standards established by Obamacare, such as coverage for maternity care and prescription drugs. Moderate Republican Senator Susan Collins dismissed that approach on Monday, telling reporters: ""I believe that it would cause further destabilization of the individual (insurance) market, it would erode protections for people with pre-existing conditions"" and cause premiums to rise. Earlier on Monday, Trump used Twitter to prod Republican senators to pass a bill, and senior lawmakers, including the Senate's No. 2 Republican, John Cornyn, said legislation could advance to votes next week in the deeply divided chamber.  ""I cannot imagine that Congress would dare to leave Washington without a beautiful new HealthCare bill fully approved and ready to go!"" tweeted Trump, who made repealing and replacing Obamacare a central pledge of his 2016 campaign. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives approved its healthcare bill in May, knowing the Senate would amend it. Republican Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota told reporters he was worried about how rural hospitals would be treated in the Senate bill, which is being assembled in secret. He said lawmakers were awaiting an assessment of a retooled Senate bill from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office before making decisions. Senior Republican Orrin Hatch said he did not yet know whether the minimum 50 Republican senators would come together on a bill, with Vice President Mike Pence casting the potential tiebreaking vote. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer wrote to McConnell urging a bipartisan effort to stabilize the health insurance market, noting that McConnell had been quoted recently as saying Congress would need to shore up that market if lawmakers fail to repeal Obamacare. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued data on Monday showing a 38 percent decrease in applications by insurers to sell health plans in the Obamacare individual market in 2018 compared with this year. Scores of protesters voiced opposition to the legislation outside Republican National Committee headquarters and at the offices of some Republican lawmakers, chanting slogans including ""Trumpcare kills"" and ""Healthcare is a human right.""  U.S. Capitol Police said 80 people were arrested.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-g20-germany-protests-idUSKBN19T0J5?il=0,"SCUFFLES, WATER CANNON AT FINAL ANTI-G20 MARCH IN HAMBURG","HAMBURG (Reuters) - Hundreds of hooded anti-capitalist militants scuffled with German police on the fringes of a largely peaceful march on Saturday against a G20 summit of global leaders in Hamburg, after two days of violent clashes which marred the G20 summit. In the late evening, after leaders had left Hamburg, police turned on water cannon to disperse remaining protestors, many drunk, who started throwing bottles and other objects. Emergency services said they were treating injured people but gave no numbers. Tensions had been high all day after riots on Friday night when radicals looted shops, torched cars and hurled objects. The city centre was in lock down with luxury shops along the main streets barricaded up and many protected by security guards. More than 50,000 people gathered for a ""G20 - not welcome"" demonstration in the port city in the afternoon. At one point a group of about 120 people, some masked, kicked police and attacked them with flagpoles before running away.  Chancellor Angela Merkel, facing an election in September, had sought to underscore her commitment to free speech by holding the summit in central Hamburg, a trading hub with a long tradition of leftist radicalism. Images of smoke rising over parts of the city, burning cars, wrecked shops and streets awash with debris have, however, raised questions about her strategy, and police reinforcements from across Germany had to be dispatched to help. Merkel, who met police and security force after the summit to thank them, condemned the violence but also said the majority were peaceful and legitimate protesters. ""I condemn in the strongest terms the extreme violence and unbridled brutality that police were repeatedly confronted with,"" she said at the end of a summit which exposed differences with the United States on climate change. ""There is no justification for plundering, arson and brutal attacks on the lives of police officers ... anyone who acts in this way .. places himself outside our democratic community."" The head of Hamburg police earlier expressed shock at the ""wave of destructive anger"", rioting and arson since Thursday.  However, on Saturday mostly young protestors, some holding balloons, others pushing prams, wanted to keep the demonstration peaceful as hip-hop and Turkish music blasted out of speakers. ""The message is G20 - never again and certainly not in Hamburg,"" Oskar Zach, 16, told Reuters. ""We aim to remain peaceful. We want to show we can demonstrate without violence.""  ATTAC coordinator Thomas Eberhardt-Koester said the movement wanted to ""bring our criticism of the G20 and our alternatives for fair global policies onto the streets"".  In the last three days, more than 200 police officers have been injured. Some 143 people have been arrested and 122 taken into custody.   On Friday night, special armed police were deployed with assault rifles after militants, described as the Black Bloc because of their trademark black hoods and masks, hurled objects, including paving slabs, and set barricades alight.   Ministers decried the violent protestors and said they would face the full force of the law. ""These are not demonstrators, they are criminals,"" said Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere. But some other politicians criticized the choice of venue. ""We should ask whether the state, with its monopoly of the right to uphold security and order, was well advised to choose Hamburg,"" Hans-Peter Uhl, a senior member of Bavaria's CSU conservatives, sister party of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) told Handelsblatt business daily. Merkel defended her choice of Hamburg, saying similar summits had been held in big cities such as London and it was unacceptable to say some places were ruled out as venues. Hamburg residents, who Merkel said would receive compensation for damage, were also angry at the destruction. ""Merkel underestimated the protests. The least she can do now is come visit (the district of) Sternschanze and see the damage for herself,"" said Kai Mertens, a 50-year-old programmer.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-05/why-you-shouldn-t-wait-unti-tuesday-to-buy-plane-tickets,Missing,"If youre even just a semi-regular airline traveler, and you like to hunt for bargains, youve probably heard that youre supposed to buy plane tickets on Tuesdays to get the best deals. But what if you found out that this applies only if you purchase right at midnight, and that it only really matters with 1.6 percent of domestic U.S. routes?Turns out, not only do you have to book the right route at exactly midnight to get a deal on Tuesdays  even if you do, youll be rewarded with a savings of just 6 percent, or $18 on average.Thats according to new data from Hopper, the aviation insights company whose fare-predicting app is built upon hundreds of billions of of airfare data points, all collected since 2013. Havent heard of it? Its worth a download: The app tells you whether to buy a ticket or hold out for better prices, and its accuracy stands up to tests better than its main competitor, Kayaks price forecaster.People want there to be this kind of golden rule you can use to know when to book your airfare, said Patrick Surry, chief data scientist at Hopper. But its hard to have a rule of thumb when the system is adapting in real time. By that, he means airline revenue managerswho used to manually adjust airfare prices to meet weekly targets and goalsare being replaced with computers, so predictable patterns for customers are becoming, well, less predictable. In the past, there used to be more human intervention where managers could create flash sales, often on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, Surry said. These decisions are largely automated now.Patterns still emerge, and Hopper applies machine learning and big data to find them. So Surry and his team whipped up new recommendations for when to bookfor both domestic U.S. and international flightsalong with insights on the potential payoffs. Out of 3,500 international routes that Hopper studied, about 900 of them posted their lowest prices on Thursdaysmore than on any other day of the week. Savings averaged $20 a ticket. Monday is also a good day to book international flights: An average of 600 routes lower their fares by $30 on that day. (As in, a smaller number of flights offer a discountbut the discount is bigger.) Avoid booking on Sundays, said Surry. Its when youre least likely to find a good deal. Compared with international tickets, domestic fares have less variation, and price drops don't often correlate with a particular day of the week. Surry postulated that this is a direct result of lower route competition: Fewer carriers are racing to connect Boston and Baltimore, for instance, than New York and London. High-volume routes, such as those that cross the Atlantic or connect international hubs, are where the law of supply and demand offers greater fluctuationsand, therefore, wider price fluctuations. In other words: Dont hold your breath for dramatic price drops on domestic U.S. tickets. By all metrics, domestic flights offer their greatest potential savings on Thursdays. Across a large swath of commonly-searched routes, Thursdays show a typical price drop of almost $15; when all 7,500 U.S. routes are considered equal regardless of popularity, the discount drops to just $12, or 3.4 percent of the average ticket. Its not a big discount, but its a common one: On Thursdays roughly 3,500 of Hoppers domestic routes drop their prices by that $12 margin.A close runner-up: Wednesday, when 3,000 routes offer a similar price savings.As for Tuesday? Its not the worst day to book. (That prize can be shared among Monday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, which all offer a combination of low savings and few routes with price drops.) But the second day of the week is hardly what its chalked up to be, with just one-third of routes offering a pitiful $10 savings on average.And staying up for a rare chance to save $18 at the stroke of midnight? It might not be worth the caffeine."

The review could lead to Sweden joining the union, he said. Bolunds spokeswoman, Anna Soderstrom, confirmed the comments.The move comes as Nordea Bank AB, Scandinavias largest lender and its only global systemically important one, has threatened to move out of the country and after neighbor Denmark started a review on joining the union in a bid to make itself more attractive. Nordea Chief Executive Officer Casper von Koskull said last week that the Stockholm-based lender may be better served by aligning itself more closely with Europe, specifically by being located in a country thats a member of the banking union.Nordea is considering both Denmark and Finland. Governments in those countries say the bank is welcome. Finland is already member of the banking union. Denmark earlier this month set up a committee to review participation for a second time; a 2015 report recommended Denmark join.Regulations in the Nordic region are generally stricter, helping ensure high credit ratings for its banks, S&P Global Ratings said in a report Monday. The ratings company said in the future regulations are likely to converge somewhat, but economic risks including high household debt mean Scandinavian supervisors will probably continue to be tougher."

The struggling airline announced Monday that it has cut meat out of economy-class meals on domestic flights ""to reduce wastage, reduce cost and improve catering service.""

Air India has been struggled to compete in the country's hugely competitive and fast-growing aviation market, needing a $4.5 billion government bailout in 2012 to keep flying.

The government is now looking to sell its stake in the national carrier.

A representative for Air India said the meatless move, which started last week, would lead to ""substantial savings"" but declined to estimate how large the savings would be.

Air India said it studied its meals data for several months and found that offerings with meat frequently went to waste.

The carrier operated about 211,000 domestic flights last year, according to data from the Centre for Aviation and Maslen Aviation Consultancy. That translates to roughly 17 million passengers at full capacity.

India has the largest vegetarian population in the world. Over 391 million people -- or roughly 30% of Indians -- consider themselves to be vegetarians, according to data from Euromonitor.

Hindus consider the cow to be sacred, and many keep to a strict vegetarian diet.

Many restaurants and food producers cater directly to vegetarians, and meals are often divided into two categories: ""veg"" and ""non-veg.""

However, vegetarianism has been on the decline, down about 8% over the past five years.

http://cnn.com/2017/07/06/design/finland-design-centenary/index.html,CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF INNOVATIVE FINNISH DESIGN,"(CNN) Given how familiar Finnish markers and motifs have become -- from Nokia phones to Moomins books -- it's remarkable that Finland has only had 100 years to imprint itself on our consciousness. Throughout that time, design has always been at the forefront of the nation's identity.

In 1917, when the country declared its independence from Russia, there was a strong desire to explore and articulate what it was to be Finnish.

Architects and designers became nation-builders, tasked with giving shape to the new homes and civic spaces that the country needed, as the economy grew and the once agrarian society began to industrialize. Their ambitious agenda was social, optimistic and forward-looking, and democratic design emerged as a significant characteristic of the fledgling country.

Leading designers

Many people found great opportunity and creative stimulus in Finland's transition into an independent modern nation, perhaps none more than the internationally renowned architect Alvar Aalto. Over the course of his long career, he championed a revolutionary style of design that combined functionality with natural materials and organic forms.

Aalto was a great ambassador for Finnish design at a time when Finns were thinking of how to present themselves to the rest of the world. When Aalto designed the Paimio Sanatorium in 1932, he applied his utilitarian approach to the building and every piece of furniture within it to international acclaim.

Soon after, he founded Artek, a design company that combines art and technology to bring about improvements in everyday urban life. Artek is a thriving design brand today and the work of Aalto continues to be revered.

Designer Kaj Franck's work epitomize progressive and socially conscious design. In 1945 he joined Arabia, a Helsinki-based ceramics company, and set about creating reasonably priced, practical objects for the working and middle classes. His Kilta tableware series (later relaunched as Teema) reflected the times and resonated with consumers. It remains a bestseller to this day.

But while Aalto and Franck's utilitarian sleekness represent a certain Finnish sensibility, Finland is a country of contrasts and contradictions, and one of its greatest is the disconnect between a characteristically introverted national character and the bold innovators it has produced.

One such innovator is Armi Ratia, the dynamic founder of Marimekko. Ratia founded the textile and fashion brand in 1951. Her ambition was to bring color and energy into the homes of the depressed postwar nation. Today it is hard to imagine the Finnish lifestyle without the vibrancy of Marimekko.

The brand was also symbolic of the equal role women played in Finnish society. Here they were leaders and innovators, creatives and commercial successes. Fashion designs were purposefully liberating and practical. Such was the synergy between the values of the brand and the values of the nation that spotting a Marimekko print on the street could be likened to seeing the Finnish flag flying.

Back to nature

The new Finland combined an independent, progressive spirit with a strong and proud national identity rooted in the past. Until 1917, Finland had been a largely rural country where small isolated communities defined society.

The harsh climate and tough living conditions created a stoic and resourceful national character with close ties to nature. As design became a tool to articulate what it was to be Finnish, many designers and architects projected the values and spirit of this culture.

Designer Tapio Wirkkala became renown for representing the natural Finnish environment in his work and for adapting the principles of traditional Finnish craft for modern industry.

Wirkkala produced everything from tableware and packaging to decorative objects and even banknotes during his career. Ice depicted in glass and wood carved into organic forms were recurring features of his work. The Ultima Thule glass collection for Iittala is an example of how he created popular, uniquely Finnish design for a mass market.

The principles and values of Finnish design, as developed in response to the needs of a new young country, remain relevant today. Young Finnish designers proudly adhere to socially minded values, and Finland remains a remarkably design-literate country, where the importance of design and design thinking is widely recognized.

Companies such as Artek, Iittala and Marimekko remain buoyant and strong, continuing to export Finland's particular design language around the world. As other countries slowly begin to turn to design to help solve social problems, the Finns can be proud, during their centenary year, that they were there first."
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-rights-liu-idUSKBN19U06H?il=0,FOREIGN DOCTORS SAY SICK CHINESE DISSIDENT LIU CAN BE TAKEN OVERSEAS,"SHENYANG, China (Reuters) - Ailing Chinese Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo can be moved abroad safely for treatment and he wants to go to either Germany or the United States, but it needs to happen soon, two foreign doctors who visited him said on Sunday. Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for ""inciting subversion of state power"" after he helped write a petition known as ""Charter 08"" calling for sweeping political reforms. He was recently moved from jail to a hospital in the city of Shenyang to be treated for late-stage liver cancer. On Saturday, two doctors from the United States and Germany visited him to assess his condition and consult on his treatment, after being invited by the hospital. ""Liu Xiaobo and his family have requested that the remainder of his care be provided in Germany or the United States,"" Joseph M. Herman of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and Markus Buechler of the University of Heidelberg said in a joint statement.   ""While a degree of risk always exists in the movement of any patient, both physicians believe Mr Liu can be safely transported with appropriate medical evacuation care and support. However, the medical evacuation would have to take place as quickly as possible."" The doctors acknowledged the quality of care he has received and said they agreed with the diagnosis of primary liver cancer.""The physicians have recommended Mr Liu receive palliative supportive care. Additional options may exist, including interventional procedures and radiotherapy,"" they said. The University of Heidelberg and MD Anderson have both agreed to accept Liu for treatment and both are prepared to offer him the best care possible, they said. China's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Liu would be allowed to leave. The hospital said on Saturday moving him would not be safe. A woman who answered the phone at the hospital on Sunday said she did not know about Liu's case. There are police cars parked outside all entrances to the hospital, which is located in the middle of downtown Shenyang.  A man, not in uniform, on Sunday blocked a Reuters reporter from entering the building where friends say Liu is being treated, saying access was only for patients or upon invitation. Calls have grown from rights groups and Western governments for China to allow Liu to travel with his wife, Liu Xia, to be treated overseas. Hu Jia, another well known dissident, welcomed the doctors' statement as very positive, saying it essentially refuted suggestions Liu was too sick to be moved and it paved the way for him to be treated abroad.  ""Firstly, this gives foreign diplomats Liu Xiaobo's authorization. Secondly, it gives them the professional assessment that Liu Xiaobo can travel,"" he said. Ye Du, an activist and friend of Liu and Liu Xia, said the statement proved that information released by the hospital was inaccurate and politically motivated.  ""I call on the governments of Germany, the United States, France and the United Kingdom as well as rights groups to pressure (China) together,"" he said.  It is not clear if the foreign doctors are still in Shenyang. A source with knowledge of the consultation and friend of the family told Reuters late on Saturday that Liu had told the foreign doctors he hoped to go abroad for treatment, but the government had been very clear they would not allow this. In a brief statement earlier on Sunday, the hospital said Liu was finding it difficult to eat and he was being given nutritional support and pain medication.

(CNN) Tupac Shakur lived much of his life in the limelight, but a letter that has surfaced from his past seems to offer rare insight into one of the late rapper's relationships.

In a note to Madonna, reportedly written by Shakur while he was serving time in prison in 1995, he acknowledges ending their romantic relationship because of her race.

""For you to be seen with a black man wouldn't in any way jeopardize your career, if anything it would make you seem that much more open and exciting,"" Tupac wrote. ""But for me at least in my previous perception I felt due to my 'image' that I would be letting down half of the people who made me what I thought I was.""

While CNN has not independently confirmed the letter's authenticity, the auction site allowed TMZ to photograph the note and publish excerpts.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-baltics-patriot-idUSKBN19V28A,U.S. DEPLOYS ADVANCED ANTI-AIRCRAFT MISSILES IN BALTICS FOR FIRST TIME,"VILNIUS (Reuters) - The United States deployed a battery of Patriot long-range anti-aircraft missiles in Lithuania to be used in NATO wargames from Tuesday - the first time the advanced defense system has been brought to the Baltics where Russia has air superiority. The Patriot battery was brought to the Siauliai military airbase on Monday, ahead of the Tobruk Legacy exercise, and will be withdrawn when the exercise ends on July 22, a Lithuanian defense ministry spokeswoman told Reuters. The NATO wargames take place ahead of the large-scale Zapad 2017 exercise by Russia and Belarus which NATO officials believe could bring more than 100,000 troops to the borders of Poland and the three Baltic NATO allies - the biggest such Russian maneuvers since 2013.  Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia possess only short-range anti-aircraft missiles, leaving the skies largely unprotected in the event of hostilities and have expressed concern about their air defense weakness following Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. As a deterrent to Russia in the flashpoint region, the United States has deployed detachments of troops since the Crimea annexation, which have been augmented by four NATO battle groups of more than 1,000 soldiers. Referring to the NATO exercise starting on Tuesday, Lithuania's Defence Minister Raimondas Karoblis said: ""The deployment of Patriots is important because it demonstrates that such moves are no longer a taboo in the region."" ""It proves that the missiles can be brought to wherever they are needed, which is very important,"" he told Reuters. ""Air defense, including ground-based defenses, is one of the holes in our defenses, and we will not solve it without help from our allies,"" he said. The Patriot batteries were used in 200 combat engagements against manned and unmanned aircraft, cruise missiles and tactical ballistic missiles, according to its maker U.S. firm Raytheon. NATO ally Poland said last week that the United States had agreed to sell it Patriot missile defense systems. In March it said it expected to sign a deal worth up to $7.6 billion with Raytheon to buy eight Patriot systems by the end of the year. Reporting by Andrius Sytas; Editing by Richard Balmforth"
http://cnn.com/2017/07/07/health/filicide-parents-killing-kids-stats-trnd/index.html,A PARENT KILLING A CHILD HAPPENS MORE OFTEN THAN WE THINK,"(CNN) It's the most unfathomable of crimes: a parent killing their own child. It grabs headlines when it happens -- like this week in Georgia, where a mom is accused of stabbing four of her children to death . The reality is, filicides happen with depressing regularity in the US. And mothers are almost as likely to be the killers as fathers.

But more than 13% of the victims were adults, specifically people in ages running from 18 to 40 years old. So the threat of filicide doesn't go away when people get old enough to move out on their own.

More than 40% of the killers in these crimes were mothers, with fathers making up about 57% of those who killed their own offspring.

once every three days. Cheryl Meyer, co-author of several books on the subject, said it's probable that a mother kills a child somewhere in the US

Only 10% of the victims were killed by their stepparents. That means 90% of the victims were the biological sons or daughters of the killer. And sons (52%) were more likely to be killed than daughters (38%).

Parents used what the study called ""personal weapons"" to beat, choke or drown victims in the majority of cases involving underage kids.

victims in the majority of cases involving kids. If the victims were adults, parents used guns in 72% of such killings.

There are several reasons why

Dr. Timothy Mariano, the study's lead author, offered up three theories: the parents are often mentally ill, they usually have higher levels of testosterone and the offspring that they kill may be considered unwanted.

Forensic psychiatrist Phillip J. Resnick, pioneer in the study of filicide research, identified five major reasons

Altruism: The parent kills the child because he or she may perceive it to be in the child's best interest. It may be reality-based (e.g., the child suffers from a terminal illness) or precede the suicide of the parent, as the parent feels it would be unfair to leave the child behind to face the cruel world.

Acute psychosis: The parent kills the child based on ideas that are inconsistent with reality. For example, the parent believes the child has been possessed by the devil.

Unwanted child: The parent kills the child that he or she regards as a hindrance.

Accidental: The child's death is an unintentional outcome of parental physical abuse."

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-10/carrefour-s-brazil-ipo-to-hand-banks-highest-fees-in-eight-years,CARREFOUR'S BRAZIL IPO TO HAND BANKS HIGHEST FEES IN EIGHT YEARS,"Brazils long-suffering IPO bankers are headed toward their biggest payday in eight years.This months initial public offering for Carrefour SAs Brazil unit will generate almost 140 million reais ($42 million) in fees for a group of local and international banks, based on a regulatory filing from the French grocery company. That tops the 119 million reais paid by BB Seguridade Participacoes SA for its 11-billion-real IPO in 2013 and is the most for a deal bigger than $1 billion since October 2009.The Carrefour pot gets split between Banco Itau BBA SA, the lead bookrunner on the offering, and the rest of the sales team: Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Banco Bradesco BBI SA, Banco Santander SA, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and BNP Paribas SA.This is the year of the comeback for IPOs in Brazil, Joelson Oliveira Sampaio, a finance professor at Fundacao Getulio Vargas, said in a phone interview. The market had stalled, with only a handful of deals since 2014.Political turmoil and a record-breaking recession prevented many large Brazilian companies from going public, with just four IPOs completed from 2014 through 2016. Things started turning around this year, with 5.82 billion reais already coming to market since January, surpassing the total for all of the previous three years combined. The Brazilian airline Azul SAs $572 million share sale in April is this years biggest so far.The IPO for Carrefours Atacadao SA unit could raise as much as 7.6 billion reais if underwriters exercise their option to sell additional shares, according to the filing. Carrefour and Peninsula, an investment company controlled by billionaire Abilio Diniz, plan to sell as many as 400 million shares for 15 reais to 19 reais each, the Boulogne-Billancourt, France-based company said in a statement in June. Pricing for the deal, which has been in the works for more than three years, is set for July 18.Executives at Carrefour and Itau declined to comment on IPO fees.Brazil has been a key factor in propping up Carrefours earnings in recent years as growth in France fizzled. Quarterly growth in same-store revenue in Brazil has ranged from 5.6 percent to 13 percent since the third quarter of 2013, significant growth for a nation muddling through a recession. Atacadaos adjusted net profit rose 53 percent to 1.17 billion reais in 2016.Carrefours IPO, which will also include its stake in Banco CSF, will be the first major test of investors willingness to bet on Brazil equity markets after a political crisis ensnared President Michel Temer in May and threatened to derail a reform agenda designed to pull Latin Americas largest economy out of its deepest recession on record.No new IPOs have priced since then, though at least three companies have filed plans for initial offerings: renewable-energy firm Omega Geracao SA, reinsurer IRB Brasil Resseguros SA and pharmaceutical company Biotoscana Investments.Read more about the resurgence in Brazils IPO marketWhile the Carrefour payout is large in dollar terms, it lags behind other recent IPOs as a percentage of deal size. Banking fees represent 2.75 percent of the Atacadao offering, compared with 3.75 percent for Azul and 4.41 percent for car-rental company Movida Participacoes SA, prospectuses show. BB Seguridades IPO fees were 1.17 percent of the total.As a general rule, banking fees rarely represent more than 4 percent of the offers size, Sampaio said. For larger, more complex IPOs such as Carrefour, banks tend to demand a higher amount of fees. But as the offer size tends to be bigger, the relative amount drops.Credit-card company Cielo SA accounted for the single biggest fee for a major Brazilian IPO in the past 10 years, with its $5.1 billion equity sale in 2006. Cielos bankers took in 275 million reais in fees at the time. Brazils largest-ever IPO, Banco Santander Brasils $7.55 billion October 2009 offering, generated 193 million reais in fees.Inflation also plays a role in driving fees higher. The nations main consumer price index rose 8.8 percent in 2016 after climbing 9 percent in 2015."

""If people did this in Egypt they would be shot,"" said Ibrahim Ali, a 29-year-old Egyptian who came here in 2011. ""The state provides everything: housing, unemployment benefits and education. Yet those people are not happy. I don't get it."" Ali and two more refugees from Syria and Egypt were serving beer, falafel, hummus, tabouleh salad and other Middle Eastern delights to protesters who had started leaving the Sternschanze quarter as police special units moved in against the rioters. ""They are crazy. I can't believe my eyes,"" said Mohammad Halabi, 32, a Syrian who arrived in Germany as a refugee some 18 months ago. ""They have such a beautiful country and they're destroying it."" Halabi, who speaks broken German, said he had been following the G20 only to see if world leaders would come up with a solution to end the civil war in Syria. His expectation were low, he said, so he was not disappointed when he read on social media on Friday that U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia President Vladimir Putin had agreed on a ceasefire for southwestern Syria. ""It's a joke. They are not serious,"" said Halabi. ""They are simply interested in preserving their own interests in Syria and the Middle East."" When he was not serving falafel, Halabi ran toward the square where rioters had set barricades on fire, and took pictures of police firing water cannon. ""This is nothing. I'm not scared,"" he said, sharing pictures with family members living in Turkey. ""Bombs falling on your neighborhood, that's scary."" Hours after police wrestled back control of Sternschanze, a traditional venue for leftist protests, residents and shopkeepers came out to inspect the extent of the damage. Some helped municipal workers who had been cleaning the streets since dusk, removing glass, concrete slabs and stones that had been hurled at police. All said they were angry at Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to hold the summit in their port city as they had feared that militant members of the Black Bloc anarchist group would resort to violence. ""It's scary what happened here,"" said teacher Sandra Janowitz, 28. ""But I don't blame the demonstrators. Most were teenagers who don't know what they're doing. And many were foreigners. They went home and we have to deal with this mess."" Merkel on Saturday defended her decision to hold the summit in the city of her birth, praised the police's security operation and said that residents would receive compensation. Unlike native Hamburg residents, Halabi said he cannot be angry at Merkel. ""Without her I wouldn't be here,"" he said, referring to the chancellor's decision to welcome refugees.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/10/health/alabama-vibriosis-bacteria-coastal-waters/index.html,ALABAMA HEALTH OFFICIALS WARN OF INFECTIOUS BACTERIA IN COASTAL WATERS,"(CNN) Four cases of people have been infected with the illness-causing bacteria Vibrio vulnificus, according to health officials in Mobile County, Alabama.

One case happened in March of this year when someone went out of the state, ate raw oysters, and became infected with Vibrio, said J. Mark Bryant, the public information officer for the Mobile County Health Department.

Another case occurred in April after a local resident consumed raw oysters in Mobile County.

""Then in June, we had two people that went into the waters south of Mobile County, and also were infected,"" Bryant said.

Infection with any form of these Vibrio bacteria causes vibriosis, the symptoms of which include watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills. If Vibrio infects an open wound, it can cause pain, redness and swelling. Skin rashes have also been reported.

Most people contract the infection by consuming raw oysters and other shellfish harboring the bacteria, or when open wounds are exposed to brackish or salt water where the bacteria is present.

Symptoms can be especially severe in people with weakened immune systems, and those who have cancer, diabetes, liver disease or other chronic conditions.

Bryant said all four cases in Mobile County were mild because they were identified and treated early.

A fifth case was reported recently in a Mississippi woman who contracted the infection while fishing on a pier in Baldwin County, Alabama.

Dr. Karen Landers, assistant state health officer for the Alabama Department of Public Health, said that despite the infection occurring in Alabama, it is being investigated by the Mississippi State Department of Health.

In an email to CNN, Dr. Paul Byers, Mississippi state epidemiologist, said, ""the Mississippi State Department of Health does not provide specific details regarding individual cases to protect personal information and to avoid patient identification.""

But Byers confirmed that the Mississippi State Department of Health did recently receive notice of a new Vibrio case, bringing the total number of cases reported in Mississippi in 2017 to nine.

Landers said the most important thing people can do to avoid Vibrio infections is to be ""wound and water aware,"" especially during the summer months when the amount of Vibrio bacteria in the water is at a higher concentration.

""The overarching message is that we must have a specific awareness for our own health and our own safety,"" said Landers.

""Let's say you sustain a wound in the water. You need to watch for signs and symptoms of illness,"" she said.

Landers asks that anyone showing signs of infection, such as redness or swelling, wash the wound and then immediately go and see their healthcare provider.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/05/entertainment/snowfall-tv-review/index.html,'SNOWFALL' WADES INTO EARLY DAYS OF CRACK COCAINE,"(CNN) The dirty business of drugs is a crowded neighborhood on television these days. Yet ""Snowfall"" carves out its own turf, delivering a potent cocktail garnished with elements of ""The Wire,"" ""Traffic"" and ""Narcos,"" as the early days of crack cocaine unfold from multiple perspectives.

It's 1983 in Los Angeles, where the abundant palm trees serve notice all that white powder isn't snow; rather, it's the riches associated with dealing coke, a high-risk exercise to say the least.

Co-created by director John Singleton (""Boyz N the Hood"") with Eric Amadio and Dave Andron, the drama actually benefits from a relatively unknown cast, adding to the sense of verisimilitude around this spare, bleak drama.

The main threads feature Teddy (Carter Hudson), a CIA agent who teams up with a Contra soldier (Juan Javier Cardenas) as part of an operation to fund the Nicaraguan forces; Franklin (Damson Idris), whose boyish looks belie steely nerves, despite a mom (Michael Hyatt) who'd brain him if she knew what he was doing; and Gustavo (Sergio Peris-Mancheta), a Hispanic wrestler drawn into a dangerous scheme by the daughter (Emily Rios) of a menacing Mexican drug lord.

Like most FX fare (including ""The Americans,"" which occupies the same time period), ""Snowfall"" pushes to the edge of premium cable boundaries -- introducing creative ways to ingest coke, or taking detours to a porn shoot or the gilded home of a ruthless Israeli dealer (Alon Moni Aboutboul).

The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) has been championed by both sides as a landmark deal for open markets against a protectionist tide, but last-minute wrangles over cheese and pharmaceuticals were holding up its start. ""Meeting at the G20 in Hamburg, reconfirming our joint commitment to the rules-based international trading system, we agreed to set the date of 21 September 2017 to start the provisional application of the agreement, thus allowing for all the necessary implementing measures to be taken before that date,"" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement. ""It is by opening up to each other, by working closely with those who share the same values that we will shape and harness globalization,"" the joint declaration said. The agreement will enter definitively into force once all 28 EU member states and parliaments ratify it. The EU had not been satisfied that Canada would effectively open up its markets to 17,700 additional tonnes of EU cheese and provide guarantees for the patents of European pharmaceuticals. A spokesman for Canadian trade minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said the allocation of the cheese tariff rate quota would be made before the September deadline. ""So what happens now is that both sides will complete their internal processes and closely consult one another on how the agreement will be implemented. This is about ensuring a smooth transition to a strong start for CETA,"" the spokesman said. Both sides had been hoping for the provisional implementation of the agreement this month.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-energy-nuclearpower-idUSKBN19S27Z,U.S. ENERGY DEPARTMENT HELPING POWER FIRMS DEFEND AGAINST CYBER ATTACKS,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Energy said on Friday it is helping U.S. firms defend against a hacking campaign that targeted power companies including at least one nuclear plant, saying the attacks have not impacted electricity generation or the grid.  News of the attacks surfaced a week ago when Reuters reported that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a June 28 alert to industrial firms, warning them of hacking targeting the nuclear, power and critical infrastructure sectors. ""DOE is working with our government and industry partners to mitigate any impact from a cyber intrusion affecting entities in the energy sector,"" a Department of Energy representative said in an email to Reuters. ""At this time, there has been no impact to systems controlling U.S. energy infrastructure. Any potential impact appears to be limited to administrative and business networks."" It was not clear who was responsible for the hacks. The joint report by the DHS and the FBI did not identify the attackers, though it described the hacks as ""an advanced persistent threat,"" a term that U.S. officials typically but not always use to describe attacks by culprits. The DOE discussed its response to the attacks after Bloomberg News reported on Friday that the Wolf Creek nuclear facility in Kansas was among at least a dozen U.S. power firms breached in the attack, citing current and former U.S. officials who were not named.  A representative with the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corp declined to say if the plant was hacked, but said it continued to operate safely.  ""There has been absolutely no operational impact to Wolf Creek. The reason that is true is because the operational computer systems are completely separate from the corporate network,"" company spokeswoman Jenny Hageman said via email. A separate Homeland Security technical bulletin issued on June 28 included details of code used in a hacking tool that suggest the hackers sought to use the password of a Wolf Creek employee to access the network. Hageman declined to say if hackers had gained access to that employee's account. The employee could not be reached for comment. The June 28 alert said that hackers have been observed using tainted emails to harvest credentials to gain access to networks of their targets. ""Historically, cyber actors have strategically targeted the energy sector with various goals ranging from cyber espionage to the ability to disrupt energy systems in the event of a hostile conflict,"" the report said. David Lochbaum, a nuclear expert at the nonprofit group Union of Concerned Scientists, said reactors have a certain amount of immunity from cyber attacks because their operation systems are separate from digital business networks. But over time it would not be impossible for hackers to potentially do harm. ""Perhaps the biggest vulnerability nuclear plants face from hackers would be their getting information on plant designs and work schedules with which to conduct a physical attack,"" Lochbaum said.   The DOE said it has shared information about this incident with industry, including technical details on the attack and mitigation suggestions.  ""Security professionals from government and industry are working closely to share information so energy system operators can defend their systems,"" the agency representative said.  Earlier, the FBI and DHS issued a joint statement saying ""There is no indication of a threat to public safety"" because the impact appears limited to administrative and business networks. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has not received any notifications of a cyber event that has affected critical systems at a nuclear plant, said spokesman Scott Burnell.  A nuclear industry spokesman told Reuters last Saturday that hackers have never gained access to a nuclear plant.

http://cnn.com/2017/07/10/health/gonorrhea-vaccine-study/index.html,RESEARCH RAISES HOPES FOR GONORRHEA VACCINE,"(CNN) Evidence from a mass vaccination campaign for an outbreak of bacterial meningitis in New Zealand had unexpected results: reduced rates of the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea, a study published Monday in the journal The Lancet finds. It is the first time a vaccine has shown any protection against gonorrhea.

Scientists say the results provide fresh inspiration for developing a specific vaccine against the STD, which causes about 78 million new cases worldwide each year.

In recent years, gonorrhea has shown increasing antibiotic resistance , with some patients unable to be treated with any available drug. Because of this, the World Health Organization includes gonorrhea in its list of bacteria that pose the greatest threat to human health.

""The emergence of completely drug-resistant gonorrhoea is a major concern,"" Dr. Helen Petousis-Harris, lead author of the new study and a senior lecturer at the University of Auckland, wrote in an email.

She explained that ""even moderate protection"" against the sexually transmitted disease could have significant impact because the bacteria that cause it ""are very tricky."" They develop resistance to drugs by transferring genes in atypical ways and recombining with related bacterial species.

""Given the emergence of drug resistance, a vaccine may be our only avenue,"" Petousis-Harris said.

'Cousin' bacteria

""In the early 2000s, there was a large epidemic of meningococcal B disease in NZ. The disease rate was very high, and it was affecting a lot of people,"" said study co-author Dr. Steve Black of Cincinnati Children's Hospital. In the absence of a vaccine, the government requested help from the WHO to ""tailor-make"" one.

Meningococcal disease, the bacterial form of meningitis, is a serious infection of the meninges, the membrane covering the brain. It's transmitted from person to person, usually in close contact, such as kissing, sneezing or coughing, or living in close quarters with an infected person.

""Meningococcal B disease is very lethal disease, and even people who survive are left with a lot of lifelong medical problems,"" Black explained.

A vaccine targeting the specific strain of bacteria causing meningococcal disease in the New Zealand outbreak was eventually ""developed in a collaboration between Chiron Vaccines, the National Institute of Public Health of Norway (NIPH) and the New Zealand government,"" according to Mary Anne Rhyne, director of corporate communications at GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceutical company that inherited the vaccine from Chiron through a series of corporate acquisitions.

The vaccine targeted the vesicle, or sac, on the outer membrane of the bacteria.

Beginning in 2004 and lasting through 2006, a mass vaccination campaign inoculated most of the New Zealand population: about 90%, including 81% of those under age 20. New Zealand scientists then published their results for the impact of the vaccine on the outbreak.

""I wondered, in looking at their results from the outbreak, if there was any possibility that this vaccine might have had any other effects,"" said Black, who focused on the country's gonorrhea statistics in particular.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacteria (which cause gonorrhea) and Neisseria meningitidis bacteria (which cause meningococcal disease) are ""two related organisms. They're cousins, if you will,"" he said, explaining that the genetic makeup of the two is ""85 to 90% similar.""

Seeing how rates of gonorrhea fell after the vaccination campaign, Black knew that a scientific study of his theory needed to be done.

Petousis-Harris and her co-researchers, who had access to a database recording events during the meningococcal B outbreak, set to work testing his hypothesis.

""We compared the vaccination rates in two groups of people,"" Petousis-Harris explained. One group had gonorrhea, and the other group had chlamydia, both of which are spread through sexual contact.

If the vaccine had an effect against gonorrhea because it is an organism related to meningococcal disease, the researchers hypothesized, then no effect should be seen against chlamydia, an unrelated organism.

""This is exactly what we saw,"" Petousis-Harris wrote in an email. ""We found that people with gonorrhoea were less likely to be vaccinated than people with chlamydia,"" indicating that the vaccine protected against gonorrhea but not chlamydia.

The researchers also discovered that vaccinated people were significantly less likely to become infected with gonorrhea than people who had not received the vaccine: 41% vs. 51%.

Taking other factors into account, including ethnicity and gender, the researchers concluded that having received the meningococcal vaccine reduced the incidence of gonorrhea by about 31%.

Still treatable, but resistance rising

Virginia Bowen, an epidemiologist in the Division of STD Prevention at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that in 2015, there were more than 390,000 reported cases of gonorrhea in the United States. This is a 13% increase from the previous year.

""It is estimated that more than 800,000 new infections occur every year, but because gonorrhea can be symptomless, fewer than half of all new infections are diagnosed,"" she said, explaining that untreated cases can cause serious problems, including conditions that lead to infertility in both men and women.

""For women, it can increase their risk for a life-threatening ectopic pregnancy,"" Bowen said. ""Untreated gonorrhea can also increase a person's risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV.""

Gonorrhea is still treatable in the US, said Bowen, though resistance to the current antibiotics may develop.

Scientists with pharmaceutical companies are working to develop a vaccine specifically against the infection.

The New Zealand vaccine is no longer licensed, but the membrane-attacking component has been included in the formulation of Bexsero, GlaxoSmithKline's meningococcal vaccine. Bexsero is made to offer broader coverage by fighting more strains than the original.

""These findings are encouraging,"" Rhyne said. ""The next step for GSK is to further explore and understand the potential of Bexsero to help protect against (gonorrhea).""

Petousis-Harris said the investigation also found the vaccine to be protective against gonorrhea hospitalizations.

Black said this suggests that the vaccine, which was effective against mild infections, may be more effective against the more severe cases.

Gonorrhea, noted Black, is in all countries. ""This is really a universal issue,"" he said. ""It doesn't kill, but it maims."""
http://cnn.com/2017/07/10/opinions/trump-not-world-leader-opinion-elmets/index.html,WHY TRUMP WILL NEVER BE A GREAT LEADER,"Doug Elmets owns Elmets Communications, a Sacramento-based public affairs firm, worked in the Reagan White House as an assistant press secretary and spoke at the Democratic National Convention as a Republican for Hillary Clinton. Follow him @ElmetsPR . The views expressed in this commentary are his own. For a counter perspective, read Jeffrey Lord's analysis .

(CNN) Ronald Reagan's defining leadership moment came in 1987, when he demanded that his Cold War adversary ""tear down"" the Berlin Wall.

John F. Kennedy's happened after the Bay of Pigs disaster in 1961, when he admitted failure in a display of presidential accountability that caused his popularity to soar.

And Franklin Delano Roosevelt? His moment came a day after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. Standing before Congress in his steel leg braces, Roosevelt delivered a speech that made clear America's resilience and declared December 7, 1941 ""a date which will live in infamy.""

Successful presidents are many things, but above all they must be great leaders. They must possess clarity of vision and the communication skills to inspire and unite. Great leaders also surround themselves with strong advisers who have license to speak their minds, and they possess the emotional capacity to connect with the dreams and fears of those they lead.

I was privileged to serve under Reagan, whose ability to rally Americans on the home front while nimbly navigating the international stage remains unmatched.

Watching Donald Trump at the G20 gathering in Hamburg, Germany, this past week got me wondering -- does our current President have what it takes to lead the free world?

My conclusion, in a word, is no. What's worse, Trump has shown little interest in rising to the occasion and learning how to lead.

To be fair, there have been moments -- such as his recent speech in Poland, in which he reaffirmed US support for NATO and delivered a rare rebuke to Russia over its ""destabilizing activities in Ukraine"" -- that felt presidential. But far more often, Trump has conducted himself like an imperious adolescent, someone who believes he has all the answers and all the right moves, reality be damned.

This is disturbing on multiple levels, but let's start with the most basic -- the damage such behavior inflicts on America's security and standing in our complicated, highly connected world.

Trump's admirers often compare him to Reagan, noting that both men were straight-talking Washington outsiders underestimated by the political establishment. For many of us who worked for Reagan, this comparison is hardly accurate.

From the moment he took office, Reagan had a vision, and he doggedly stuck to it for eight years. Domestically, it was smaller government and lower taxes. Internationally, the mission was about defeating communism while spreading democracy and freedom for all.

Reagan was, of course, an ardent defender of American greatness -- remember the ""shining city upon a hill?"" -- and he understood that world peace depended on a strong United States. But his nationalistic pride never turned boastful on the world stage. He was restrained in his use of force, and he understood diplomacy and the importance of allies.

Trump, meanwhile, has pursued a foreign policy that is utterly incoherent, characterized by bullying, bragging and impetuousness.

There was the January raid on Yemen, ordered with little preparation or coordination. When the operation went poorly, Trump refused to take responsibility and blamed ""the generals"" for the death of Navy SEAL William ""Ryan"" Owens.

Then came the cruise missile strike against Syria, which Trump reportedly ordered after seeing TV images of children killed and sickened by a chemical attack authorized by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

The bombing did little to change the tragic realities in Syria. In fact, CNN reports that the Syrian air base the United States struck was up and running shortly after.

And let's not forget Trump's appalling interactions with some of America's most important global partners. His testy phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia were downright bizarre, with Trump barking at Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull about a refugee agreement and boasting about the size of his electoral college win.

And Trump's initial meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany was awkward at best. Among other highlights, Trump ignored Merkel's request for a handshake from Oval Office photographers and made an odd quip about wiretapping that left Merkel visibly puzzled.

With regard to Asia, the administration's zigging and zagging has been particularly perilous. Under President Barack Obama, the United States undertook a delicate rebalancing of Asian relations that included the negotiation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multilateral trade deal that would have created new opportunities for US exporters in agriculture, services and high-end manufacturing, as well as other economic benefits.

Trump tore that up, and his approach to China has ranged from vague Twitter threats to what looked like a budding bromance with President Xi Jinping at a Mar-a-Lago meeting in April. After North Korea launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile on July 4, Trump did another 360, taking to Twitter to criticize China for not doing enough -- even though the country is integral to efforts to rein in Kim Jong Un.

The costs of his errant judgment were plain to see at the G20 summit, where our most important economic and strategic allies effectively ostracized the United States on everything from trade to climate change and immigration. It is true that Trump held bilateral meetings with the leaders of Britain, China and Turkey, as well as a highly anticipated tete-a-tete with Russia's Vladimir Putin. But those meetings could not alter the fact that Trump's protectionist ""America first"" crusade has left the United States isolated.

Watching the spectacle from afar, I found myself missing the Gipper. During Reagan's first term, he talked tough and even engaged in a bit of name-calling -- dubbing the Soviet Union the ""evil empire"" -- while wrestling with his biggest foreign policy challenge. He was also a fervent critic of arms control during the height of the nuclear arms race.

Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook

But by his second term, Reagan was engaged in a crucial disarmament dialogue with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. Reagan saw that Gorbachev's goals could benefit American interests, so he dialed back his hawkish impulses to begin a more pragmatic, mutually respectful relationship with the Soviet leader.

That was Reagan's way -- adapt when necessary and press forward with optimism. And it paid off handsomely for our nation, not just with a reduced nuclear arsenal but through stabilization of Social Security, a strong Federal Reserve, low inflation and tax cuts.

Will Trump eventually understand that true leadership is about more than chest thumping and arrogant posturing?

I'm not holding my breath.

Trump has shown that a leadership style that might have worked during his previous life as a corporate czar does not translate well in the White House. Unable or unwilling to change, Trump continues to behave as if things should go his way just because he says so."

The countries have sought to extract concessions from Qatar in return for restoration of diplomatic and economic ties. The demands include closing the state-funded Al Jazeera media network, reducing diplomatic ties with Iran, and halting the construction of a Turkish military base in Qatar.

Last week, the four nations said they would continue the boycott after a deadline for Qatar to comply with their demands came and went without a resolution being agreed. Qatar's foreign minister said his nation wouldn't comply with any demands that it considers a violation of international law.

Diplomatic efforts are underway to resolve the crisis.

There have been 275,987 suspected cholera cases and 1,634 deaths from the illness between April 27 and July 5, the WHO said in a statement Wednesday. Children under the age of 15 make up 41% of these cases, and people older than 60 account for 33% of the deaths.

""If you get caught early in the morning with this and you don't get treated by the end of the day, then you really have a problem,"" WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said. ""A weak elderly person could really be dead by the end of the day.""

The WHO said in a statement last week, ""we are now facing the worst cholera outbreak in the world.""

Cholera is caused by ingestion of Vibrio cholerae bacteria, which are spread through water or food that is contaminated with feces. Eighty percent of people with cholera don't have symptoms, but they are still capable of spreading it. Those who do show symptoms have a sudden onset of watery diarrhea, which can lead to death by severe dehydration. About 14.5 million people in Yemen don't have access to clean water and sanitation, according to the WHO.

All but two of the nation's governorates have been hit by the outbreak.

The WHO has partnered with the United Nations Children's Fund and local health authorities to deliver medication and aid to combat the ongoing outbreak, including the establishment of 45 diarrhea treatment centers and 236 oral rehydration therapy corners. Lindmeier said it is essential for people who are infected to rehydrate immediately.

""The biggest challenge is reaching people,"" he said. ""This is great. This is a major effort and a huge logistical effort, but people need to know that they can get there. People need to know that they can find these places.""

Efforts have been complicated by Yemen's civil war, which has left more than 18.8 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the WHO. Many of the country's trained medical personnel have fled or been killed as the conflict intensified over the past two years, said Juliette Touma, UNICEF's regional chief of communications for the Middle East and North Africa.

Touma traveled to Yemen in early June to see what work was being done and said she was impressed by the dedication of health workers. However, she couldn't help but think about all the people who still needed relief.

""What I kept thinking about was all of these children who couldn't actually make it to medical care because they live in the remote parts of Yemen and the rural areas where there are no facilities, or those who couldn't afford to pay,"" Touma said.

Since the outbreak began, campaigns and community volunteers across the country have been trying to spread the message of how to prevent cholera, she said, including how to clean water, to wash food before eating it and to take general hygienic measures.

But Touma said there is a lot more to be done.

""As long as we have more reports and suspected cases of cholera, and as long as the number of suspected cases increases -- and it has been increasing by the day -- we can't unfortunately say there has been progress,"" Touma said. ""There is a cure for cholera, we can cure it, and that is very much dependent on getting in essential supplies, but we need to get more. We need to get more dedicated personnel."""

Learn more about the sixth extinction and get involved.

To understand how big of a deal that is you don't have to look much further than the definition of ""mass extinction."" It means that three-quarters of all species vanish -- forever.

In all of history, that's happened only five times.

The sixth extinction would be the first caused by humans.

""We are basically annihilating the life on our planet -- and that is the only known life ... in the entire universe,"" said Paul Ehrlich, Bing professor of population studies at Stanford University.

""It's life that shaped the planet, that made it possible for us to live here. It's life that still makes it possible for us to live here. (If) we don't have the diversity of other organisms, we're done.""

I've been reporting on the coming extinction crisis this year for a CNN series called ""Vanishing."" And I can tell you that while this topic is enormously depressing, there is some good news: We know how to slow or hopefully stop the sixth extinction.

Anthony Barnosky, another extinction expert, also from Stanford, told me humans have at most 20 years to make sweeping changes about our relationship with nature. If we do that, he said, we can avoid the sixth extinction.

But here's what needs to happen, according to the experts.

1. Stop burning fossil fuels

JUST WATCHED If coral reefs disappear, so will they Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH If coral reefs disappear, so will they 06:08

Burning fossil fuels and chopping down rainforests is heating up the atmosphere. That's creating trouble for all corners of the natural world, from the Rocky Mountains, where the tiny pika is overheating , to the oceans, where coral reefs are being decimated as the oceans warm and become more acidic.

We know that to avert the worst of climate change we need to limit warming to at most 2 degrees Celsius . To do that, the world needs to be off fossil fuels this century -- hopefully closer to 2030 than 2100. That's a tall order, but Stanford University researchers have shown we can do it with existing technology like wind, solar and nuclear.

Policies that promote cleaner energy include carbon taxes, cap-and-trade pollution pricing systems and renewable energy tax credits. The Paris Agreement on climate change, ratified by the United States and 115 other countries , also creates a framework for a rapid shift away from fossil fuels. The Trump administration in the United States, however, threatens to move the world's second-biggest climate polluter away from that agreement and back towards dirty, climate-warming fuels.

2. Protect half the Earth's land -- and oceans

This idea comes from renowned biologist E.O. Wilson: Put aside half the surface of the Earth -- both land and oceans -- for the betterment of the nature and biodiversity. Maybe that sounds like a lot, but Wilson argues it's necessary if we want to avert crisis. Some 84% of species could be saved if we protected all that land. ""That amount, as I and others have shown, can be put together from large and small fragments around the world to remain relatively natural, without removing people living there or changing property rights,"" Wilson wrote in an op-ed in The New York Times

3. Fight illegal wildlife trafficking

JUST WATCHED Iconic African elephant population on the brink Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Iconic African elephant population on the brink 05:49

Some of the world's most iconic species -- particularly the elephant and rhino -- are threatened with extinction simply because people are slaughtering these majestic creatures to sell their body parts on the black market. Elephant ivory is carved into trinkets. And rhino horn is mistakenly sold as an aphrodisiac.

And there are other less-known markets, too, including those for pangolin meat (a delicacy), giraffe tails (bracelets) and tiger bone (medicine). Efforts to shut down these markets have been grossly inadequate, as the black market in environmental products is estimated to be worth $91 billion to $258 billion per year . Compare that to drug trafficking, the most lucrative black market, which is worth $344 billion per year, according to a United Nations and Interpol estimate.

Experts say better law enforcement is needed to stop poaching. And consumers -- especially those in Asia, where wildlife products tend to be popular -- need to stop buying these illegal and harmful goods. Groups like WildAid and Education for Nature Vietnam are using advertising campaigns to try to make these products seem uncool.

It sounds callous, but more people means more food, more land and more resources. Ehrlich, from Stanford, said population growth is one of the main drivers of the Earth's extinction crisis. The population was about 4 billion in 1980. It's now 7.4 billion and is rapidly heading for 9.7 billion by 2050 , according to the United Nations.

5. Reconnect with the natural world, and open our eyes

If there's a fact that underlies all this, perhaps it's this: We're no longer connected to nature. We don't understand it and therefore, naively, dangerously, we figure it's doing just fine or will rebound. Barnosky, the extinction expert from Stanford, said we think of the natural world like a bottomless checking account when we need to see it as a savings account.

We humans also have ridiculously short attention spans. Issues like extinction and climate change play out over decades, centuries and millennia. Our actions now -- or inaction -- will matter for thousands of years. ""You can have catastrophic events that are seen in slow motion, basically, and not register on people very well,"" said Ehrlich. We must find a way to reconnect with nature and to see this wave of extinction for the crisis that it is.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-26/buffett-s-bet-on-store-shows-not-all-retail-real-estate-is-equal,Missing,"Warren Buffett is betting that some types of brick-and-mortar real estate will hold up better than others in the age of Amazon.His Berkshire Hathaway Inc. took a 9.8 percent stake in Store Capital Corp., sending shares of the real estate investment trust surging Monday. Unlike other retail landlords that have come under pressure as consumers shop more online, Store focuses on service properties: preschool facilities, health clubs, dine-in movie theaters and pet-care sites. Less than a fifth of its portfolio is invested in traditional retail -- and even those it calls internet resistant, including furniture stores, hobby and craft centers, and hunting, fishing and camping shops.Store doesnt compete on the beaten path, said Haendel St. Juste, an analyst at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. They are targeting more experiential retail, trying to provide a buffer against risk.Retail REITs have taken a beating from investors as Amazon.com Inc. and other online sellers make it easier for consumers to buy clothing, toys and other items from their computers or smartphones and not have to step foot into a physical store. Buffett, for his part, has long expressed confidence in property investments to generate income for extended periods of time, and to provide a cushion should the dollar lose value. He has said such bets, whether in buildings or agricultural land, are often safer than gold or bonds.Ideally, these assets should have the ability in inflationary times to deliver output that will retain its purchasing-power value while requiring a minimum of new capital investment, Buffett wrote in a letter to shareholders in 2012. Farms, real estate and businesses such as Coca-Cola Co. meet that double-barreled test.As an owner of single-tenant buildings, Store manages its properties differently than many retail landlords. Tenants cover the costs of operating the real estate, including taxes, maintenance and insurance. Scottsdale, Arizona-based Store essentially acts as a finance company for middle-market tenants without access to affordable capital, St. Juste said.They get mom-and-pops capital on much better terms by monetizing their real estate, he said.Store Capital issued 18.6 million shares to Buffetts company in a private placement at $20.25 apiece, the REIT said Monday in a statement. That compares with Fridays closing price of $20.77. The $377 million investment by Berkshire follows a deal last week in which it agreed to prop up Canadas Home Capital Group Inc. by providing a credit line and committing to take an equity stake.Store Capital Chief Executive Officer Christopher Volk said on Monday that Berkshire had been studying the REIT since 2014, occasionally holding conversations with management. Ten days ago, Buffetts deputy investment manager Ted Weschler called the company to suggest a deal because the price had fallen to an attractive level, Volk said.Berkshire Hathaway is fundamentally a value-oriented investor, he said in a Bloomberg Radio interview. The trading price had dropped because there was a fear that we had a lot of retail exposure, which we actually dont. Were predominantly focused on the service sector.Store Capital had slipped 16 percent this year through Friday. It jumped 11 percent on Monday, its biggest gain since the companys 2014 initial public offering. Home Capital had plunged even more before Berkshire agreed to step in. Then the Toronto-based lender jumped 27 percent the day after the deal was announced.Buffett has other bets on commercial real estate. Berkshire and Leucadia National Corp. are joint owners of Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC, a provider of banking and sales services to the property industry.The billionaire has also personally invested in REITs. After Sears Holdings Corp. spun off some of its properties into an entity called Seritage Growth Properties, he took an 8 percent stake in the trust. The deal followed an investment, in 2000, in Aegis Realty Inc., which at the time owned shopping centers and other properties in 15 U.S. states."
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-idUSKBN19V04D?il=0,"OIL RISES SLIGHTLY, BUT GROWING GLOBAL SUPPLY A WORRY","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose modestly on Monday, but increased drilling activity in the United States and uncertainty over Libyan and Nigerian production cuts clouded the future supply outlook.   U.S. crude futures settled up 17 cents or 0.4 percent to $44.40 a barrel, while Brent crude futures also rose 17 cents or 0.36 percent to $46.88 a barrel. Despite the modest rally on the day, Brent crude prices were 17 percent below their 2017 opening level. With lingering questions surrounding production cuts, the market is ""iffy on what OPEC is going to do,"" said James Williams, president of energy consultant WTRG Economics in London, Arkansas. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and some non-OPEC members agreed in May to curtail production until March 2018, but the move has failed to eliminate a global glut of crude. Several key OPEC ministers will meet non-OPEC country Russia on July 24 in St Petersburg, Russia, to discuss oil markets. Kuwait said on Sunday that Nigeria and Libya had been invited to the meeting and their production could be capped earlier than November, when OPEC is scheduled to hold formal talks, according to Bloomberg. However, Nigeria's oil minister was unable to attend the OPEC meeting because of a previous commitment, the Kuwait Oil Minister Essam al-Marzouq told reporters on Monday. Libya said on Monday it was ready for talks but added that its political, economic and humanitarian situation should be taken into account in talks on caps. Meanwhile on Monday the CEO of Saudi Aramco Amin Nasser told a conference in Istanbul he thought the world was headed for a global supply shortage. ""The volume of conventional oil discovered around the world over the past four years has more than halved compared with the previous four,"" Nasser said. Yet U.S. oil production continues to grow, rising more than 10 percent since mid-2016. U.S. energy firms added seven oil drilling rigs last week, marking a 24th week of increases out of the last 25 and bringing the count to 763, the most since April 2015, energy services company Baker Hughes said.    BNP Paribas joined a growing list of investment banks and analysts that have cut their crude oil price forecasts for the coming year. ""We thus have made deep cuts to our crude oil price forecasts. We now see the price of WTI averaging $49/bbl in 2017 (-$8/bbl revision) and that of Brent $51/bbl (-$9/bbl revision),"" the bank said in a note.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-idUSKBN19U08D,U.S.-RUSSIAN CEASEFIRE DEAL HOLDING IN SOUTHWEST SYRIA,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - A U.S.-Russian brokered ceasefire for southwest Syria held through the day, a monitor and rebels said on Sunday, in the first peacemaking effort of the war by the U.S. government under President Donald Trump.  The United States, Russia and Jordan reached the ""de-escalation agreement,"" which appeared to give Trump a diplomatic achievement at his first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Germany this week.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said ""calm prevailed"" in the southwest since the truce began at noon (0900 GMT) on Sunday despite minor violations.  Combatants briefly exchanged fire in Deraa province and in Quneitra around midnight, but this ""did not threaten the ceasefire,"" said Observatory Director Rami Abdulrahman.     Major Issam al Rayes, spokesman of the Southern Front coalition of Western-backed rebel groups, said ""a cautious calm"" continued into the evening. ""The situation is relatively calm,"" Suhaib al-Ruhail, a spokesman for the Alwiyat al-Furqan faction in Quneitra, said earlier.  Another rebel official, in Deraa city, said there had been no significant fighting. It was quiet on the main Manshiya front near the border with Jordan, which he said had been the site of some of the heaviest army bombing in recent weeks. ""Syrian ceasefire seems to be holding ... Good!"" Trump tweeted on Sunday.  A Syrian official indicated that Damascus approved of the ceasefire deal, describing the government's silence over it as a ""sign of satisfaction."" ""We welcome any step that would cease the fire and pave the way for peaceful solutions,"" the government official told Reuters. A witness in Deraa said he had not seen warplanes in the sky or heard any fighting since noon. ""We negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives,"" Trump said in an earlier tweet on Sunday. ""Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!"" A senior U.S. State Department official involved in the talks said further discussions would be necessary to decide crucial aspects of the agreement, including who will monitor its enforcement. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the truce included ""securing humanitarian access and setting up contacts between the opposition in the region and a monitoring center that is being established in Jordan's capital."" Ahead of U.N.-based peace talks set to open on Monday, a spokesman for the opposition delegation said in Geneva the deal showed a ""serious international effort to bring peace."" ""Russia has been waiting for an American strategy to crystallize vis-a-vis Syria,"" said Yahya al-Aridi. ""And we believe this is quite serious in part from the United States to broker such a ceasefire, and we want it to be extended to other parts of Syria, to all of it."" Several ceasefires have crumbled, however, since the onset of the conflict. With the help of Russian air power and Iranian-backed militias, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has put rebels at a disadvantage over the past year. The wide array of mostly Sunni rebels include jihadist factions and other groups supported by Turkey, the United States and Gulf monarchies. Earlier talks between the United States and Russia about a ""de-escalation zone"" in southwest Syria covered Deraa province on the border with Jordan, nearby Sweida and Quneitra, which borders the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Deraa and Quneitra are home to tens of thousands of people and form a center of the insurgency south of the Syrian capital, Damascus. Rebels said intense air strikes had pounded Deraa's opposition territory in recent weeks.  The multi-sided Syrian conflict, which grew out of popular protests against Assad's rule in 2011, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and created the world's worst refugee crisis.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-07/musk-robbed-of-model-3-victory-lap-with-worrisome-week-for-stock,TESLA'S STOCK SELLOFF MESSES UP MUSK'S BIG WEEK,"This was supposed to be Elon Musks big week, capped by Tesla Inc.s first Model 3 sedan rolling off the assembly line. Instead, shares that had been riding high in anticipation of his most consequential car yet are poised for their worst week in almost a year and a half.A troublesome quarterly sales report, the emergence of competing electric vehicles from the likes of Volvo Car Group and lingering concern about Teslas ability to mass produce have sent its stock down 13 percent this week. Modest gains in Friday trading still have left the shares on course for their steepest weekly drop since February 2016, and Teslas market value has dropped back below General Motors Co.This weeks worries put a damper on the arrival of the linchpin to Musks growth ambitions. For Tesla, bringing out Model 3 and becoming more of a mass-market carmaker will require overcoming the routine manufacturing issues that have handicapped output of batteries or Model X sport utility vehicles. And so-called legacy automakers have sent a clear signal they wont go down without a fight -- Volvo underscored this by announcing all of its new models will have hybrid or fully electric powertrains from 2019.Tesla still faces a lot of challenges, said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at Autotrader. The company needs to focus on quality over speed as they ramp up the Model 3. The Volvo announcement drove home the fact that Tesla is going to face more competition.The first blow to Tesla stock came just after regular trading stopped ahead of the July 4 holiday. The Palo Alto, California-based posted a quarter-by-quarter drop for both the Model S sedan and Model X SUV for the three months ending in June. Musk needs revenue from both to keep funding the costly introduction of the Model 3 and get production to levels that could put Tesla on course for profits that have mostly eluded the company.Tesla issued an update to its deliveries figures on Friday to add that about 3,500 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the second quarter, detail that was missing from its initial statement Monday. The company said those cars will count toward its third-quarter tally.Within its sales report, Tesla cited issues with making 100 kWh batteries, a disclosure analysts have said should have been made earlier. The surprise snag reinforced doubts about whether Musk can smoothly ramp up to building hundreds of thousands of cars annually, from the roughly 84,000 built last year.Musk himself seems to have dialed back his expectations. The chief executive officer tweeted this week that Tesla was planning to hand over the keys to the first 30 owners of the Model 3 on July 28, produce 100 of the cars in August, more than 1,500 in September and 20,000 in December.Thats well below the 100,000 to 200,000 Model 3s that Musk said in May 2016 was Teslas goal for the second half of this year. On the same earnings call last year that the CEO gave that forecast, Musk said Tesla was going to be hell-bent on becoming the best manufacturer on earth.In addition to execution risk, competitive threats have dragged on Tesla shares. On Wednesday, Volvo said it planned to electrify its entire lineup and have five models powered entirely by batteries in its lineup by 2021. The Swedish carmaker owned by China-based Geely Automobile Holdings underscored that Tesla will soon have more competition coming from major carmakers, Barclays Plc analyst Brian Johnson said.Weve long argued that Tesla as an EV company is not truly disruptive, in that legacy carmakers will eventually wake up and offer fully electric vehicles by the early 2020s, Johnson wrote in a report Wednesday.Volkswagen AG bolstered Johnsons view days later, with the German automakers namesake brand chief touting an electric hatchback similar to the bestselling Golf. The car, dubbed Neo, will be priced along the lines of the Golfs diesel version and have a range of as much as 600 kilometers (370 miles) on a full battery, Herbert Diess said in an interview.We see Volkswagen as the company that can stop Tesla, because we have abilities Tesla doesnt have today, Diess said in Frankfurt.Teslas stock has long been caught in the middle of a duel between short sellers and Musks true believers, with Musk drawing big-name detractors including Jim Chanos, who famously bet early on energy company Enron Corp.s failure and was proved right.Short interest in Tesla has ebbed but is still at 23 percent of the float, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Greenlight Capital Management founder David Einhorn, who successfully pressured Apple Inc. to double cash returns to shareholders in 2013, also has been shorting the company.Tesla still has plenty of bulls betting the companys value will grow over the long term despite many bumps along the way. Thousands stood in lengthy lines at Tesla stores last spring to place $1,000 deposits for the Model 3, which is expected to start at about $35,000 before options or incentives and have a range of at least 215 miles per charge.Longtime Apple analyst Gene Munster said this week the launch of the Model 3 will ultimately be compared to Apple Inc.s introduction of its iPhone.Over the next 10 years the Model 3s value, in combination with its technology, has the potential to change the world and accelerate the adoption of electric and autonomous vehicles, Munster wrote in a report Wednesday. This should propel shares of TSLA higher and, more importantly, advance us to a new paradigm in transportation, car ownership, ride hailing, city development, and energy usage.The fact that Musks clean-energy pursuits extend beyond cars helped keep the week from being even worse for Tesla. The billionaire said a supply contract with South Australia reached on Friday will bring about the words largest lithium-ion battery system. Tesla climbed as much as 2.6 percent at 12:35 p.m. Friday.Australia aside, the slowing of Model S and Model X sales and production issues continuing to plague Teslas plants has shown Musk has lots of work ahead to accomplish his grand vision, let alone support Teslas more than $50 billion market capitalization.In May, Musk told the Guardian newspaper that Teslas valuation topping carmakers that sell substantially more vehicles -- like GM -- was unwarranted.I do believe this market cap is higher than we have any right to deserve, Musk said."

Goldstone said Veselnitskaya opened the meeting with the younger Trump with a few remarks on campaign funding before switching to the issue of a ban on U.S. adoption of Russian children, at which point Trump halted the meeting.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-07/ahead-of-putin-trump-meets-mexican-leader-about-drugs-security,TRUMP AND PENA NIETO DONT DISCUSS WHO WILL PAY FOR THE WALL,"President Donald Trump said Friday that Mexico should absolutely pay for his proposed border wall, a key part of his election campaign.But Trump never raised the issue in a sit-down with Mexicos president on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Germany, just like he didnt when he visited Mexico City during the presidential campaign last year.That omission was confirmed by Mexican officials and the White Houses own statement after the meeting, which mentioned trade, drug trafficking and the political crisis in Venezuela but was silent on the border wall.As the two leaders began their meeting, a reporter asked Trump if he still wanted Mexico to pay for a wall to control the flow of undocumented immigrants into the U.S., a proposal that was one of Trumps biggest applause lines during the presidential campaign. ""Absolutely,"" Trump said.Yet even if Trump did want to discuss the wall with President Enrique Pena Nieto, Mexico has repeatedly said it has no intention of paying for it. And the U.S. president has focused more lately on efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and drug-policy cooperation with Mexico. Hes even suggested putting solar panels on the wall could help it pay for itself.Trump says solar wall on Mexican border would pay for itself""Weve all had a very successful day and a very interesting day. Its great to be with my friend, the president of Mexico,"" Trump said as he and Pena Nieto began the meeting. ""Were negotiating Nafta and some other things with Mexico. Lets see how it all turns out. But I think weve made very good progress.""Trump went on to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, one of the most closely watched events at the summit. Trump and Putin shook hands at the start of the summit, and their foreign-policy chiefs -- Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov -- met for an hour on the sidelines of the summit today.Trump earlier attended an opening session with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other leaders, huddling with his top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ahead of the meeting. At the event, Trump was seated between Chinese President Xi Jinping and British Prime Minister Theresa May.This is the first sit-down between the Mexican leader and Trump since Trump visited Mexico last August, before his election victory. Pena Nieto scrapped a January session after Trump tweeted that it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting if Mexico remained unwilling to pay for the construction of a badly needed border wall between the neighboring allies and trading partners.Trump in April threatened to terminate Nafta, which he has highlighted as a cause of U.S. job losses, only to pull back from that stance and call for renegotiating aspects of the agreement with Mexico and Canada.While maintaining a push to increase deportations, Trump has dialed back the frequency and intensity of his rhetoric over the border wall even as he continues to tell supporters at rallies that the wall will be built. Many Republicans in Congress remain skeptical of the proposal.At a rally last month in Iowa, the U.S. president proposed building a border wall that includes solar panels, saying it could pay for itself by creating energy, thereby allowing Mexico to pay much less."

Two people have been arrested, police say

(CNN) An American tourist was beaten to death by a group of 10 men while visiting a Greek island in the Mediterranean, state media reported.

Bakari Henderson, 22, was at a bar in the Greek island of Zakynthos with his friends Friday when a man approached him and they began fighting, according to state news agency ANA-MPA.

The fight escalated into a brawl on the streets after the bar's security asked the men to leave, ANA-MPA reported.

Two people, a 32-year-old Serbian and a 34-year-old Greek national, have been arrested. Police are searching for others who may be involved.

Zakynthos, an island in the west coast of mainland Greece, is popular among tourists for its cliffside beaches and sea caves.

http://cnn.com/2017/07/10/entertainment/patton-oswalt-engagement-critics/index.html,PATTON OSWALT RESPONDS TO ENGAGEMENT CRITICS,"The 48-year-old comedic actor announced his engagement to actress Meredith Salenger last week.

Some have questioned whether Oswalt has moved on too quickly from the death of his wife, Michelle McNamara, who passed away in her sleep last April due to a combination of prescription medication and an undiagnosed heart condition.

The ""Veep"" actor on Saturday shared on Facebook a post from blogger Erica Roman in which she defends Oswalt and Salenger's engagement.

Roman, who unexpectedly lost her husband around the time McNamara died, targeted those who criticized Oswalt's engagement, saying ""You aren't entitled to an opinion.""

""You don't get to comment on the choices of a widower while you sit happily next to your own living spouse,"" Roman wrote. ""You didn't have to stand and watch your mundane morning turn into your absolute worst nightmare.""

Oswalt praised Roman's post when he shared it on Facebook.

""I expected some bitter grub worms to weigh in (anonymously, always always always) with their much-needed opinions when I announced my engagement last week. And I decided to ignore them,"" Oswalt wrote. ""But yeah, I felt this rage. And Erica articulated it better than I could have ever hoped.""

The 47-year-old Salenger also shared Roman's post and a few thoughts of her own.

""Everyone has been so lovely to us... ALL of Michelle's siblings and friends and family... a few trolls have strong opinions,"" Salenger wrote in a note she shared on social media. ""But I think for Patton, having met and found love after over a year of intense therapy and openly grieving and dealing with his pain...I am grateful to be the one who helps him climb out of the depths of grief and find some joy again.""

Most important, Salenger said, is that Oswalt and McNamara's young daughter Alice is happy.

""I have waited 47 years to find true love,"" Salenger wrote. ""Creating our family unit while honoring the brilliant gift Michelle has given me will be my life's goal and happiness. I am deeply in love with both Patton and Alice and very much looking forward to a beautiful happy life having adventures together."""

http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/05/health/claire-wineland-cystic-fibrosis-eprise/index.html,'LITTLE BUDDHA' WISDOM FROM A TERMINALLY ILL 'GOOFBALL',"Venice Beach, California (CNN) As a small child, she played hide-and-seek with nurses, ripped out IVs to race around the hospital floor naked and left an explosion of glitter in her wake.

As a teen, she got boys to carry her uphill when she was tired, taught her best friend how to flirt and watched her doctor squirm as he gave her the safe-sex talk.

And as an adult, Claire Wineland has continued living out loud, even as her body fails her.

Claire, 20, has cystic fibrosis, a genetic and terminal progressive disease that's landed her in the hospital for a quarter of her life. Ask what's on her bucket list, and she'll say she doesn't have one.

Fixating on a checklist of goals before she goes ""sounds exhausting,"" she says, especially ""when you've been dying your whole life."" Instead, she'd rather focus on doing all she can in each moment.

It's a sort of wisdom that makes some describe this California free spirit as ""an old soul"" or ""a little Buddha.""

I meet Claire in a Venice Beach cafÃÂ©; everyone who works there seems to know her. She's on a mission to normalize sickness, push back at those who pity her and have a meaningful life for however long it lasts. Although she certainly has her down days -- ""Who doesn't?"" she notes -- this self-described ""goofball"" tackles life with humor and the sort of charisma that draws people to her.

Claire Wineland smiles broadly at a comedy roast to raise money for Claire's Place Foundation in July 2015.

Still, she says, she must train people to feel comfortable around her.

""I can't just expect people to know what to say,"" she says, ""I have to make them see me as more than my illness.""

She's been working at it on a number of fronts: In high school, she created a series of videos that went viral and penned pieces for national audiences, including one for CNN . She's appeared in magazines, on television shows and at teen award ceremonies. She's heading up a foundation, writing a book -- she promises it's not ""another happy sick person book"" -- and packing in as much as her 5-foot-2, 95-pound frame can handle.

Through it all, she gives public talks. On this day, that's at a TEDx event in Encinitas, a beachside community 100 miles south of her apartment in LA's Venice Beach.

We'd arranged to take the train down for the event. But she'd been fighting a fever as high as 103 the day before, the result of one of many infections her body continuously fights. When I offer to drive instead, she seems relieved. I am, too.

She's chatty and bubbly for most of the two-plus-hour trip, until she feels the fever coming back and curls up in the passenger seat for a nap. The only sound from her now is an occasional cough and the pumping of a portable oxygen concentrator, which gives her the air she needs without the burden of a tank. When I glance over, I spot a tattoo on her left ankle: the ""thumbs up"" logo from ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,"" with the phrase ""DON'T PANIC.""

But I start to do so when she wakes up and says her lungs feel ""funny."" At the venue, she makes her way to the ""green room,"" where she sits, eyes closed, willing stomach pains to subside, trying to pull it together. She's set to go on in 20 minutes, and I'm afraid she won't make it.

More than a sick kid

She's been riveting audiences since she was 14, when she first stepped on a stage in a new ruffled dress. When I picked her up at her apartment, she wore faded black jeans and a black T-shirt that read ""Sexual Intellectual.""

""Life is too short to not be yourself,"" she said.

Ever since she was little, she found it strange how people treated her. They'd peer down with sad eyes and say, ""I'm so sorry."" It was a statement she heard so often, it was hard not to internalize. And in a society consumed with being healthy, she grew confused.

""What happens when you have an illness where you're never going to be healthy?"" she asked. ""Does that mean I'm never going to have a life? Am I never going to do anything or be anything other than a sick kid?""

Claire is one of 70,000 people worldwide, 30,000 in the United States alone, who live with cystic fibrosis, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation estimates. To have the disease, both parents must be carriers of the CF gene. If they are, there's a one in four chance their children will be born with the disease.

Cystic fibrosis leads to an overabundance of mucus, which blocks airways and traps infections in the lungs, complicates digestion, affects the pancreas and other organs and, with time, causes respiratory failure.

At last count, Claire says, she's had more than 30 surgeries. On a daily basis, she takes about four dozen medications, including self-administered shots for her CF-related diabetes, and might spend up to six hours on breathing treatments.

She dons a vest to shake her lungs and loosen mucus, and uses a nebulizer to blow in steam and inhale medicines. She can cough up enough mucus each day to measure in cups. She gets admitted to the hospital for regular tuneups and intensive treatments.

All the while, with her lung capacity diminished, her body works harder to breathe.

""It's like I'm jogging 24/7,"" she said. She must consume as many as 5,000 calories a day to maintain her weight -- forget about gaining any.

That explains the two large pastries she ordered for lunch when we met, and the French fries she got to go. And it's why her younger sister, Elanore Nordquist, 13, used to get miffed whenever she wasn't allowed a second piece of cake but Claire could always have as much as she wanted.

Even with this carte blanche for consumption, Claire takes in 2,000 calories through a feeding tube as she sleeps, while a machine helps her breathe so her body can rest.

Pineapples and mushrooms

Claire can laugh at the absurdities in her life. She tells stories of strangers who've approached her with unsolicited prescriptions for cures. The produce section of Whole Foods is ripe for material, she says. One shopper told her she simply needed to eat more pineapple. Another said all she required was a mushroom cleanse.

And then there was the homeless guy outside a gas station who insisted that the mind can change reality and that she didn't need to be sick. She remembered thinking, with a laugh, ""If that's true, why are you homeless?""

But it was a friend who, when Claire was 11, changed her outlook by handing her a book he insisted she see.

Claire has always welcomed chances to escape Los Angeles and breathe cleaner air. Here, she visits Vancouver, British Columbia, several years ago.

It was Stephen Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time."" The cosmology book blew her young and curious mind, and she rushed to the library to learn more about its author. Only then did she find out that Hawking had ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease, and was terminally ill, too.

Until that moment, Claire -- an avid reader -- had yet to find any role models, examples of sick people doing remarkable things.

""His body was completely failing, but he was contributing something incredible to society,"" she said. Hawking's diagnosis did not define him. ""He transcended it.""

In him, she found inspiration, though it would take a steep downturn for her to see her way up.

Flatlining

The sicker a person with cystic fibrosis gets, the more work they need to do to stay relatively well -- and the harder it is to do that work. It's enough to make some ""CFers,"" as Claire calls them, stop trying.

She gets it because she was once there.

""It's not that I wanted to die,"" she said. ""But I didn't know how to live.""

At 12, she feared that she was surviving just to survive.

During a hospital stay, she had become close friends with Vanessa, another girl with cystic fibrosis. CFers aren't supposed to be together, as they carry bacteria that can be deadly if shared. But these two girls connected at a safe distance, doing art projects across the room while wearing protective masks. They made disco balls for the nursing station out of crushed CDs and glue, shared an understanding and a sense of humor and, over the course of a year and a half, a deep friendship. And then, Vanessa died.

Bereft and facing a lifetime of treatments, Claire asked herself, ""Why am I doing this?""

Claire and her sister, Elanore Nordquist, cuddle the night before Claire moves out of the house. One of the things Claire appreciates most about Elanore is that she's never treated Claire like a sick person.

So she began to lie, saying she took her medications and treatments when she didn't. For a year, her health slipped, and she said no one could figure out why. Claire, who'd always peppered her doctors and nurses with questions, knew the language and how to trick everyone.

The day after her 13th birthday, a straightforward surgery to deal with acid reflux spiraled into chaos. She contracted a blood infection that attacked her lungs. She could feel them failing.

As her oxygen levels plummeted, she began hallucinating. In a moment of clarity, she thought, ""I don't want to actually die. I want to see what happens in life. I want to see where it goes.""

She was placed in a medically induced coma, intubated and hooked up to an oscillator, a machine that gently puffed air into her fragile lungs. No child with CF had successfully come off an oscillator, doctors told her parents. Claire says she was given a 1% chance of survival. She flatlined twice.

Her little sister was 6 at the time. Elanore remembers a social worker talking to her before she went in -- ""all sanitized and in a gown"" -- to see Claire.

""They told me to say goodbye,"" Elanore said. ""They told me 'she's probably not going to wake up.' ""

A winter wonderland

There was no white light. Instead, Claire transported herself to a place she'd never been: Alaska.

Her subconscious journey began beneath ice water, she says. When she surfaced, she peered up at a mountain of snow. She sat amid ice-crystal-covered pine trees, floated on ice sheets while looking up at stars and hung out in a woodland house where animals streamed in to visit her.

After her coma, Claire traveled to Sitka, Alaska, the place she believes she subconciously visited.

Claire remained in a coma for more than two weeks. When she woke up, she learned that her dream world had unfolded while she had been submerged in an ice bath to bring down her fever.

Though conscious again, she couldn't walk, sit up or hold silverware. She had to wear diapers. Her mom called her ""Grandpa,"" a memory that still makes her laugh.

""My body had no reserves left,"" she said. ""It was kaput.""

In the many months she worked to get stronger, she found renewed purpose.

""I feel like she had a spiritual experience,"" said her mom, Melissa Nordquist Yeager. ""She came out inspired to help others.""

Finding meaning by giving back

Claire entered the world the way she lives: boldly.

Yeager was overdue to give birth to her firstborn when a routine ultrasound morphed into a scene of terror.

She watched the doctor's face as he studied the screen. He ducked out and returned with another doctor. They told her that something was wrong with the baby and that Yeager had to be induced immediately.

Claire was born with meconium ileus, a bowel obstruction that is a telltale sign of CF. Her bowel had ruptured, leaving her belly protruded, and she was whisked off for the first of many surgeries.

""The prognosis was five years,"" Yeager said, ""and that was a maybe.""

Claire spent the next seven weeks in neonatal intensive care. Her father, John Wineland, recalls peering down at his daughter as she screamed amid the medical equipment and tubes. Their eyes locked.

""It's going to be OK,"" he remembers telling her. ""We're in this together.""

Just like that, Claire's parents, who then lived in Austin, Texas, were jolted from naivetÃÂ©.

Claire has spent a quarter of her life in the hospital, mostly at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center in California, where her medical team is just like family.

Raising a daughter with CF ""has consumed most of my attention, most of my life,"" said Yeager, who now lives in Seal Beach, California. She and Wineland, of Santa Monica, never married and decided to split when Claire was 3, but they remained close friends and have continued to tackle Claire's care together.

With Claire in the hospital two or three months a year, Yeager never felt that she could build a career. She lost a handful of jobs and quit others as hospital stays dictated. She'd take the day shifts with Claire while Wineland took nights. He'd hunker down next to Claire in the hospital, watch movies with her at 3 a.m. when she couldn't sleep, and head to work in the morning.

All the while, Claire's parents -- and, by extension, Claire -- were surrounded by friends. They'd come to the hospital with meals, stick around when her parents couldn't, help rally the family and manage their lives. They also helped make Claire more outgoing and sociable, her dad says.

Claire grew up knowing that she and her parents were fortunate, that too many families lacked the support they had. After waking from her 16-day coma, Claire proposed starting an organization to offer financial and emotional help to others navigating life with CF.

Whether it's covering rents, mortgages, insurance premiums or car payments, Claire's Place Foundation aims to relieve pressure when CFers are hospitalized so families can focus on what matters most. Not long ago, it even helped find an apartment for a homeless CFer who was floating between shelters.

What started as ""a side project to celebrate (Claire's) life and survival became a passion of all of ours,"" said Yeager, who serves as the executive director.

And for Claire, the foundation changed everything.

""All throughout my teenage years, I was able to hold on to the foundation as a means to remind me that I had value,"" she said. ""It's important for people who are sick to feel empowered. It gives them reason to take care of themselves.""

Don't touch her sushi

In high school, Claire launched The Clairity Project , a website offering insight into her life, including videos that became popular on YouTube.

She offered honest talk with a smile about dying, life expectancy, even the perks of being sick. She gave tips on how to interact with sick people, answered questions she's often asked and introduced her family . She and her father, on guitar, performed together, singing Bob Dylan's ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door.""

She stepped away from making videos after no longer seeing eye-to-eye with a production company that got involved. Instead, she decided to focus on what she could control and feel good about: the foundation and her speaking engagements.

She also embarked on a new phase: Since graduating high school, she's lived on her own with a roommate in Venice Beach.

A 2015 trip to Europe with childhood friend Alicia Schomer, who says Claire has changed her: ""I'm not as terrifed of the thought of death anymore, but I am terrified of not living life to the fullest.""

It can be hard for any parent when a child leaves the nest, but for Claire's mom, the transition has been even more fraught.

Yeager knows how much work goes into Claire's care and worries that her daughter won't ask for help.

""I'm happy for her, and I know she's capable,"" her mother said. ""But I just see how sick she's getting.""

A year ago, Claire was at 50% lung capacity, Yeager says. Today, she's at 30%. She must take antibiotics to beat back recurring infections, which have become resistant to most of the drugs.

And when she turned 18 and could decide for herself, Claire announced that she wasn't interested in being on the list for a double lung transplant.

""I had to be honest,"" she said. ""It's not for me and never has been.""

Though transplants can extend a life, they're no cure. She'd have to live on steroids, which she hates taking. She'd run the risk of developing new issues when she's used to the ones she has. Plus, her body could reject the new lungs.

""And you can't eat sushi afterwards. That's a no,"" quipped Claire, who says she'd spend hundreds of dollars a month on sushi alone, if she could.

Therapies developed in trials are now helping many CFers, according to the She insists that she's not giving up, though. Instead of opting for a transplant, she's holding out hope for a cure. If she got new lungs, she says, she wouldn't qualify for drugs in development.Therapies developed in trials are now helping many CFers, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation , and eventually, with other clinical trials now underway, as many as 95% of CFers could benefit.

Her decision was a blow to her parents. They've had to accept that she won't pursue an option that could give her another 10 years.

""Just think of it as insurance, even if you don't want to do it,"" her mom pleaded at first. ""Get on the list so you can change your mind.""

But Yeager, no matter how uncomfortable it makes her, knows to trust her daughter's intuition.

""She has a relationship with her body that is sacred,"" explains her dad, who, like Claire, is a practicing Buddhist. Claire's thinking, he said: ""This is the body I came in with. This is the body I'm going out with.""

And as her father, ""I have to live with it.""

Claire, unplugged

Claire is Wineland's only child. He says she's helped him become a better person.

He's learned ""to not be afraid of what hasn't happened yet"" and believes that Claire is exactly how she's supposed to be. He's learned to ""love what is.""

At 51, he finds comfort in meditation and yoga, which Claire practiced for years, before her coma.

Wineland is a life and relationship coach. Together, he and Claire have explored ways to grow spiritually. When Claire was 10, he says, she walked on fire at a retreat run by motivational speaker Tony Robbins. He's had to figure out healthy ways to deal with pain, even to see the beauty in it.

""When you don't know what's going to happen to your only child,"" he says, ""it can be pretty debilitating.""

Claire's parents, Melissa Nordquist Yeager and John Wineland, split when Claire was 3 but remain close friends and partners when it comes to her care.

Humor has also helped him cope. When there's a long line at a restaurant, he says, he'll sometimes send her to the front of the line coughing to play ""the sick-kid card.""

Yeager too marvels at what Claire's done for her. She says her daughter's aura and energy lift those around her, making Claire ""a force of nature.""

During a recent hospital stay, mother and daughter were talking about death, a subject they don't shy away from.

""After you die, you're closer to everyone you love, because you're part of everything,"" Yeager remembers Claire saying. The words were a gift, a reminder that her daughter's essence will remain always, even after she's gone.

""If and when it does happen,"" Yeager said, ""I'm never going to forget her saying that.""

Elanore, Claire's only sibling, is more no-nonsense. She never treated Claire differently, a fact Claire has always treasured.

""She couldn't care less that I was sick, which I loved,"" Claire says. ""It was refreshing.""

When she was younger, Elanore cared so little that sometimes she'd even unplug Claire's oxygen without telling anyone.

""We wrestled a lot,"" Claire remembers with a laugh. ""She'd unplug it to make me tired so she could win.""

She gets how sick Claire is today. Still, she doesn't see Claire as a sick person.

""She's just a person,"" Elanore says. ""She's not all-knowing. She's still figuring it out, like a lot of people. ... She needs the freedom to be a 20-year-old.""

'It's OK to feel pain'

Though Claire had been attending Santa Monica College, part of her freedom meant putting school on hold.

""Truth be told, I probably wouldn't make it to graduation,"" she said. ""I feel my body changing, and I had to make an executive decision.""

Instead, she's focusing on what she can accomplish now -- including a new partnership with Zappos for Good to make hospitals more, well, hospitable. She's designing the renovation and decoration of a playroom and intensive care rooms at the Children's Hospital of Nevada at UMC in Las Vegas, which Zappos will pay for. The partnership began after Claire addressed about 2,000 people at the company in November.

Calling her ""super inspiring,"" Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh said, ""I'm pretty sure she brought tears to most of the people in the room.""

What her Zappos audience didn't know that day was how awful Claire felt.

Over the past couple years, she's had more bad days than good. And in Claire's world, that can't stop her. If she bowed out whenever she felt under the weather, she says, she'd never accomplish a thing.

It's like that again today as she sits in the green room in Encinitas, the TEDx audience awaiting her talk.

The venue is a large meeting space behind a vegan restaurant. Attendees sip kombucha on tap and exchange hugs that last extra beats. When someone asks whether there's a yoga instructor in the room, they raise their hands en masse. Outside in the hallway are pieces of self-help literature, an announcement for a festival ""dedicated to the Divine Goddess"" and business cards for a spiritual medium.

When I peek in on Claire, I grow worried. The room is dark, and her eyes are closed, her arms folded across her belly. I fight every protective instinct to whisk her off and take her home.

Instead, she rallies.

As the emcee introduces her, Claire stands tall, showing no sign of pain or discomfort. She strides toward the stage amid applause, her smile wide. If not for the pumping oxygen concentrator slung over her shoulder, strangers might not suspect that anything's wrong.

She jumps in and talks about the fear she had when she first spoke publicly, the guilt she felt whenever she landed in the hospital, the isolation CFers often feel. She also speaks of what inspires her and her understanding that illness shouldn't stop anyone from living proudly.

""It's OK to feel pain and experience it,"" she says. ""I'm not trying to fix myself. My suffering has given me so much.""

For about 18 minutes, she sets out to change how people think.

When she's done, the crowd stands and applauds. Some audience members hoot and holler. As she weaves through the crowd toward the exit, I chase after her, overhearing whispers like, ""What a gem.""

It's clear people would like to talk to her, hug her, corner her for conversation. She shoots me a glance, though, that says, ""Let's get out of here.""

Claire has given all she can, and she knows she'll pay a price.

The price

In the weeks that follow, Claire can't shake that infection. Then, in mid-June, an ambulance rushes her to the ER: Her fever is back at 103, her heart rate is at 185, and her white blood cell count is 30,000. Claire's oxygen saturation levels are falling, a sign of lung failure.

Not since the scare that landed her in a coma six years earlier has the situation felt so dire, her mother says.

For a few days, Claire only gets worse. She's transported to Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, where the staff feels like family. She has sepsis and a severe case of pneumonia and spends a week in intensive care. Doctors come close to putting her on a ventilator when one of the only two antibiotics that still work for her kick in.

""I thought this was it,"" Yeager says. ""It was an eye-opener for all of us.""

It's too early to know how much of a toll this setback will take on Claire, who is expected to head home from the hospital Wednesday.

""We think of Claire as invincible,"" her mother says, ""and this was a reminder.""

A reminder of how important it is to live each moment fully. A reminder of the lessons Claire still hopes to teach before it's too late."

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-roche-shire-haemophilia-idUSKBN19V0HX,"SHIRE, ROCHE SLUG IT OUT IN BILLION-DOLLAR HAEMOPHILIA DRUG BATTLE","ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Roche's (ROG.S) bid to take a chunk of the $11 billion haemophilia drug market dominated by Shire (SHP.L) took another blow with the Irish company winning a preliminary injunction over its Swiss rival's medication. Shire said its injunction in a court in Germany, where Roche presented data on its drug emicizumab on Monday, sought to remedy Roche's ""incomplete and misleading"" statements about the role of Shire's drug FEIBA in adverse events in Roche trials.   The fight underscores the high stakes of emicizumab's approaching arrival on the haemophilia A market, with some analysts estimating $5 billion in annual sales. That would poach business from Shire's older drugs for the condition in which sufferers' blood does not clot properly. Roche blamed several instances of thromboembolic events, including damage to blood vessels in vital organs, in haemophilia A patients on Shire's bypassing agent. It recommended doctors avoid using FEIBA, if possible, to treat bleeds that developed in patients, despite getting emicizumab. Shire, which says Roche ""unlawfully disparaged"" FEIBA, said it aimed ""to prevent further dissemination of the inaccurate and misleading characterisation of the serious adverse events"" in the Roche trial. While Shire's drug carries warnings for thromboembolic events, Juliana Dierks, its global haematology franchise head, said Roche has failed to provide adequate data to back up its claim.  ""To imply a cause-and-effect of FEIBA having caused the severe adverse events is misleading,"" Dierks told Reuters. ""We are looking forward to transparency. Give us the data, give us the facts."" In the Hamburg court's order, among other things, Roche was forbidden for now from making promotional statements describing emicizumab it as ""well tolerated"" or saying that adverse events occurred in four people when they received high doses of Shire's drug concurrently with Roche's medication. The court said it had jurisdiction because Roche was preparing to present information about emicizumab at the  International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis congress this week in Berlin.  The injunction is an interim measure and Roche can appeal it. Roche said it was reviewing it after being served on Monday. A spokeswoman said on Monday the Basel-based drugmaker stood ""100 percent"" behind its statements about emicizumab and guidance for doctors treating bleeds.  Roche shares were up 0.5 percent at 1300 GMT, while Shire's were down 1.6 percent. This is the latest legal battle involving Shire against Roche over emicizumab. Baxalta, which Shire bought in 2016, is suing the Swiss company over patent infringement.  Bernstein has said Shire's share in haemophilia A is expected to fall to 29 percent from 49 percent by 2021 on the combined effect of Roche's drug and other new medicines. Roche, which has filed emicizumab for European and U.S. approval, said the drug cut the treated bleed rate by 79 percent compared with bypassing agents, according to its latest data.

http://cnn.com/2017/07/07/opinions/trump-fell-for-putins-trap-psaki/index.html,PUTIN SET A TRAP AND TRUMP FELL INTO IT,"Jen Psaki, a CNN political commentator and spring fellow at the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service , was the White House communications director and State Department spokeswoman during the Obama administration. She also was a consultant for Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Follow her: @jrpsaki . The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.

(CNN) The Russians just played the President. It was predictable. And he let it happen.

On paper, Vladimir Putin should not have had the upper hand going into the meeting.

To start with, Russia has been living with sanctions put in place more than three years ago because of their annexation of Crimea.

And most Americans, save a few people including the President of the United States, are confident that Putin led the Russian intervention into the American election and into many other elections around the world.

President Obama booted out nearly three dozen spies in December and closed two compounds, and there are many, from both parties, calling for an additional round of sanctions on Russia

We should have had some leverage. So what happened?

To start with, the Russians are skilled public manipulators.

When I was at the State Department, the country that was easiest for our team to work with on logistics -- whether it was access to the press, or when to do statements or take questions -- were the Russians. They understand, better than most, the importance of the public side of diplomacy. It made planning easy, but it also required on-the-fly adjustments to make sure that the Russians didn't read out meetings or characterize conversations without the perspective of the United States. And they still got the best of us from time to time.

They know how to stage-manage and how to set the expectations for global events. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is a smooth operator who knows how to charm cameras and international audiences. He is visible at international events and followed by a gaggle of adoring state-run media. He also rarely shies away from answering questions, holding press conferences, or reading out meetings. He has been on the international scene as foreign minister for 13 years, and as the UN ambassador for 10 years before that, and it shows.

Putin may have less of a warm diplomatic bedside manner, but he understands the art of presentation and how to set a trap.

And set a trap is exactly what he just did.

The Russians telegraphed in advance of the meeting that their agenda was to 1) publicly mend the relationship, 2) gain a better understanding of US policy, and 3) discuss joint concerns over terrorism. They scored on all three.

Their previewing kept expectations low and made clear that there simply would not be enough time to talk about Ukraine.

And how did the United States preview the meeting and set the table for the most important diplomatic engagement this summer?

JUST WATCHED Coons: Trump raising election meddling with Putin 'long overdue' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Coons: Trump raising election meddling with Putin 'long overdue' 03:16

Just yesterday, President Donald Trump questioned the validity of American intelligence on foreign soil and then questioned whether other countries or actors were involved in the hacking.

But before that, H.R. McMaster, the President's national security adviser, previewed the meeting with President Putin by saying there was ""no specific agenda -- it's really going to be whatever the President wants to talk about.""

The problem is that the expectation-setting and previewing of important diplomatic meetings does more than just fill wire reports and cable air time. It sends the message about what the United States expects to accomplish, how prepared we are for the engagement and also puts the difficult topics on the table that are the core purpose of these meetings.

We did a background briefing with policy experts in advance of nearly every trip Secretary John Kerry did when I was at the State Department. These briefings were often on the plane late at night or early in the morning, sometimes at Andrews Air Force Base and even on the ground. They were demanded by the press corps, but also benefitted the United States because they allowed us to set the table for our engagements.

JUST WATCHED Things Trump has said about Putin Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Things Trump has said about Putin 01:27

Immediately following the meeting, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson appeared on television making clear that President Trump had repeatedly raised Russian meddling in the meeting. That sounded like a positive development until he said President Trump has decided to focus on ""how do we move forward from something that may be an intractable disagreement at this point.""

This statement was quickly followed by Foreign Minister Lavrov appearing on television to say that President Putin had denied involvement, Trump said reports of meddling were exaggerated and he accepted Putin's denials.

Leading American intelligence agencies , Republicans and Democrats in Congress and many members of his own administration are confident that the Russians intervened in the American election last year. But a simple assurance from President Putin overrides that.

You don't get a lot of shots at pressure in diplomacy. And after you've let your adversary off the hook, you certainly don't get to apply that pressure again. As far as the Russians are concerned, the public case is closed.

Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook

The problem is that the free public pass doesn't make it harder for Russians to proceed with their ongoing efforts to intervene in American democracy, to create confusion and disarray in our system.

And there are ample opportunities.

And instead of presenting evidence during his meeting with President Putin and making clear that he would stand with Democrats and Republicans and the leading intelligence agencies, Trump accepted the assurances of Putin all while smiling in front of the cameras. And the Russians have photos -- that they are already expertly spreading around the Internet -- to prove it."
http://cnn.com/travel/article/ahmedabad-first-unesco-city-india/index.html,AHMEDABAD BECOMES INDIA'S FIRST UNESCO HERITAGE CITY,"Zoha Qamar, CNN Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Updated 10th July 2017

(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ The 600-year-old walled city of Ahmedabad has been recognized as a ""UNESCO World Heritage Site,"" making it the first Indian city to be added to the coveted list.

In Poland this weekend, the 41st session of the official UNESCO committee met and voted in over 20 new inscriptions, bringing the grand total of World Heritage Sites to 1073

The rich culture of Ahmedabad's walled city, which was named in the early 1400s after Sultan Ahmed Shah, draws from its diverse history of Muslim, Hindu, and Jain influences.

A haveli (mansion) stands beside The Kalupur Swaminarayan Temple in Ahmedabad, where the city's Heritage Walk of scattered monuments starts.

Its traditional houses and streets, finished with intricate bird feeders and community wells, celebrate the fusion of Indo-Islamic architecture and art.

Mahatma Gandhi established his first Ashram in the city when he returned from South Africa to India in 1915. For years, it served as the hub for Gandhi's fight for Indian independence.

Indian Hindus celebrate Holi, the Festival of Colors, at the Swaminarayan Temple in Ahmedabad on March 13, 2017.

Modern day Ahmedabad has long since outgrown its walled enclosure. Today, the old walled quarter is located within the greater city of Ahmedabad, an industrial metropolis of over five million. In early 2016, Ahmedabad was named a ""Smart City"" by Prime Minister Modi due to its ""sustainable and inclusive development.""

Ahmedabad is currently the largest city in the western province of Gujarat, where Modi served for nearly 14 years as chief minister.

Modi began the process of Ahmedbad's nomination to the World Heritage committee in 2010 during his tenure in Gujarat, according to the acceptance speech by India's UNESCO representative, Ruchira Kamboj

In a Twitter post Sunday, Modi said the accolade was ""a matter of immense joy for India.""

With this new addition, India will boast a total of 36 World Heritage Sites , which include the iconic Taj Mahal in Agra and the Red Fort in Delhi."
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-10/china-hedge-funds-bounce-back-from-their-worst-year-since-2011,Missing,"Start your day with what's moving markets in Asia. Sign up here to receive our newsletter.China-focused hedge funds bounced back from their worst performance in five years and trounced global counterparts.After an annual loss last year, Greater China hedge funds added more than 13 percent on average in the first half of 2017 to rank among the top-performing strategies in the world, according to preliminary data from Eurekahedge. Hedge funds from Greenwoods Asset Management, Springs Capital and SPQ Asia Capital were among standout performers with gains of 20 percent or more.Hedge funds worldwide are struggling with investor redemptions after central bank intervention suppressed volatility and sapped returns. China funds were a rare pocket of outperformance as global hedge funds on average gained about 2.4 percent in the first half, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc. data Monday. Investors are taking notice: the majority of China-focused hedge funds saw inflows in May for the first time since 2015, according to a report by research firm eVestment. While Greater China equity funds overall benefited from surging Hong Kong-listed shares and large-cap stocks on the mainland, well-timed bets on technology, Internet and consumer companies drove returns at some of the top performers. In recent years, China-focused hedge funds have helped shield investors from losses in falling markets and have roughly kept pace with benchmarks in volatile conditions, said Peter Laurelli, global head of research at eVestment.China funds average performance in the first half was twice the 6.3 percent gain in a HFR index tracking equity-focused funds globally, benefiting from investments in healthcare and emerging markets.The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies listed in Hong Kong touched post-October 2015 highs in the first half. The MSCI China Index added about 24 percent through June 30. Chinas initiation into MSCI Inc.s indexes has further boosted the outlook for the nations largest stocks.Greenwoods $1.6 billion Golden China Fund made nearly 27 percent in the first half, according to an estimate sent to investors. Performance was boosted by bullish bets on consumer stocks listed in Hong Kong and China, and Internet-related companies traded in the U.S., as well as service companies on the Hong Kong stock exchange, Joseph Zeng, chief executive officer of Greenwoods Hong Kong company, said.The SPQ Asia Opportunities Fund, which gained 22 percent in the first half, was helped by profitable investments in technology and consumer discretionary stocks, and companies that run after-school education programs for young students in China, according to Gregoire Dechy, chief operating officer of Hong Kong-based SPQ. One of the funds picks was Momo Inc., the mobile social networking platform whose shares have more than doubled this year.The fund makes three-fourths of its investments in stocks with a market value of more than $5 billion dollars, Dechy said.Other managers found opportunities in overlooked areas.

They can take their cases to immigration court while stay is in place

(CNN) Iraqi nationals with final orders of removal from the US cannot be deported for at least another two weeks, a federal judge has ruled.

Judge Mark Goldsmith extended a temporary stay blocking their deportation until July 24, according to the judge's order.

The judge said the court needed additional time to determine whether the court has jurisdiction over the case in the first place, according to court documents.

The group of Iraqi nationals who filed the initial lawsuit along with the ACLU argued that there was ""good cause"" for extending the stay, because Iraqis in danger of deportation face the same threats they did when the initial stay was granted a few weeks ago: fear of ""persecution, torture or even death,"" upon return to their country, according to court documents.

Attorneys arguing on behalf of the federal government did not initially agree, but conceded during the court hearing that the court had the power to extend the stay, according to court documents and Lee Gelernt, ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project deputy director.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-10/jawbone-liquidation-inflicts-losses-prompts-ceo-move-to-health,Missing,"Jawbone Inc. is liquidating, though its chief executive officer is starting again with a company that moves out of the fitness-tracker business in favor of health-related products, an area that deeper-pocketed rivals also are entering.Founded in 1999, Jawbone was once a darling of Silicon Valley and regarded as a pioneer in wearable technology. Yet the company missed payments, had manufacturing issues that led to refunds for its fitness device and cut employees, despite raising multiple rounds of funds over a span of more than a decade. The closely held company also struggled against bigger competition that moved into the wearables market.Now Jawbone is going out of business and investors, including BlackRock Inc. and the Kuwait Investment Authority, are tallying losses from more than $900 million in equity and debt funding the fitness gear maker raised over the years.Hosain RahmanFor his part, CEO Hosain Rahman has founded Jawbone Health Hub, according to people familiar with the matter. Many Jawbone employees are moving to the new company, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the issue is private. The Information first reported the news Thursday.The liquidation comes after multiple strategic changes and failures. Last year, Jawbone put its wireless speaker business up for sale to focus on health and wearables. It also ended production of fitness trackers and sold its remaining inventory to a third-party reseller. Last January, the company raised $165 million from lead investor Kuwait Investment Authority at about half its 2014 valuation of $3.2 billion, according to Pitchbook Data Inc.Jawbone has also been locked in legal battles with Fitbit Inc. since May 2015, when Jawbone accused Fitbit in a lawsuit of plundering employees and critical proprietary information. The biggest asset left in the company is the remaining litigation against Fitbit, from which Jawbone thinks it can generate returns back to its creditors, one of the people said.The company has been working for several months to focus on health care. Though analysts say working on health-related products and services is a step in the right direction as general fitness trackers become commonplace, theres skepticism as to whether the company can succeed, given the similar direction from rivals like Fitbit and Apple Inc.Fitbit is looking to eventually deliver consumer subscriptions that predict health outcomes to move beyond hardware and into a recurring revenue stream, though this strategy is likely three to five years out, said Joe Wittine, an analyst at Longbow Research.These companies have all realized heck, we need to move on beyond just offering a bunch of data and offer some form of additional intelligence. If we identify some abnormality in your heart rate, would people be willing to pay for that service? If its enterprise grade, you bet, Wittine said.Jawbone Health Hub could sell its future device to insurers, hospitals, and employers, according to Jitesh Ubrani, an analyst at IDC. The company would have to invest heavily in research and development to develop medical-grade devices that could measure important health indicators like oxygen level or blood glucose levels, he said.Its a nail in the coffin for the way we know Jawbone today, Ubrani said. Well probably know them very differently going forward. Within the medical industry they might be recognized but not by the consumer.A once prized investment, Jawbone attracted investors such as Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Khosla Ventures. Originally the company made namesake bluetooth headsets and later diversified into portable speakers -- the Jambox -- and UP fitness bands. While initially popular, having won plaudits for design and functionality, the company was often plagued by costly manufacturing problems and was sometimes forced to offer customers refunds.Jawbone also found it difficult to compete with Fitbit, Apple and cheaper devices from China, and ultimately faced job cuts, product delays and executive flight. Having raised some $900 million in equity and convertible debt funding, the liquidation will likely wipe out equity held by investors, meaning big losses.BlackRock, which lent Jawbone $300 million in 2015, marked down the value of debt it held in the company by almost 98 percent, according to a July 5 filing. Blackrock also holds a stake in the new firm, Jawbone Health, the filing shows."
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-baltics-patriot-idUSKBN19V28A?il=0,U.S. DEPLOYS ADVANCED ANTI-AIRCRAFT MISSILES IN BALTICS FOR FIRST TIME,"VILNIUS (Reuters) - The United States deployed a battery of Patriot long-range anti-aircraft missiles in Lithuania to be used in NATO wargames from Tuesday - the first time the advanced defense system has been brought to the Baltics where Russia has air superiority. The Patriot battery was brought to the Siauliai military airbase on Monday, ahead of the Tobruk Legacy exercise, and will be withdrawn when the exercise ends on July 22, a Lithuanian defense ministry spokeswoman told Reuters. The NATO wargames take place ahead of the large-scale Zapad 2017 exercise by Russia and Belarus which NATO officials believe could bring more than 100,000 troops to the borders of Poland and the three Baltic NATO allies - the biggest such Russian maneuvers since 2013.  Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia possess only short-range anti-aircraft missiles, leaving the skies largely unprotected in the event of hostilities and have expressed concern about their air defense weakness following Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. As a deterrent to Russia in the flashpoint region, the United States has deployed detachments of troops since the Crimea annexation, which have been augmented by four NATO battle groups of more than 1,000 soldiers. Referring to the NATO exercise starting on Tuesday, Lithuania's Defence Minister Raimondas Karoblis said: ""The deployment of Patriots is important because it demonstrates that such moves are no longer a taboo in the region."" ""It proves that the missiles can be brought to wherever they are needed, which is very important,"" he told Reuters. ""Air defense, including ground-based defenses, is one of the holes in our defenses, and we will not solve it without help from our allies,"" he said. The Patriot batteries were used in 200 combat engagements against manned and unmanned aircraft, cruise missiles and tactical ballistic missiles, according to its maker U.S. firm Raytheon. NATO ally Poland said last week that the United States had agreed to sell it Patriot missile defense systems. In March it said it expected to sign a deal worth up to $7.6 billion with Raytheon to buy eight Patriot systems by the end of the year. Reporting by Andrius Sytas; Editing by Richard Balmforth"
http://cnn.com/2017/07/05/health/claire-wineland-cystic-fibrosis-eprise/index.html,'LITTLE BUDDHA' WISDOM FROM A TERMINALLY ILL 'GOOFBALL',"Venice Beach, California (CNN) As a small child, she played hide-and-seek with nurses, ripped out IVs to race around the hospital floor naked and left an explosion of glitter in her wake.

As a teen, she got boys to carry her uphill when she was tired, taught her best friend how to flirt and watched her doctor squirm as he gave her the safe-sex talk.

And as an adult, Claire Wineland has continued living out loud, even as her body fails her.

Claire, 20, has cystic fibrosis, a genetic and terminal progressive disease that's landed her in the hospital for a quarter of her life. Ask what's on her bucket list, and she'll say she doesn't have one.

Fixating on a checklist of goals before she goes ""sounds exhausting,"" she says, especially ""when you've been dying your whole life."" Instead, she'd rather focus on doing all she can in each moment.

It's a sort of wisdom that makes some describe this California free spirit as ""an old soul"" or ""a little Buddha.""

I meet Claire in a Venice Beach cafÃÂ©; everyone who works there seems to know her. She's on a mission to normalize sickness, push back at those who pity her and have a meaningful life for however long it lasts. Although she certainly has her down days -- ""Who doesn't?"" she notes -- this self-described ""goofball"" tackles life with humor and the sort of charisma that draws people to her.

Claire Wineland smiles broadly at a comedy roast to raise money for Claire's Place Foundation in July 2015.

Still, she says, she must train people to feel comfortable around her.

""I can't just expect people to know what to say,"" she says, ""I have to make them see me as more than my illness.""

She's been working at it on a number of fronts: In high school, she created a series of videos that went viral and penned pieces for national audiences, including one for CNN . She's appeared in magazines, on television shows and at teen award ceremonies. She's heading up a foundation, writing a book -- she promises it's not ""another happy sick person book"" -- and packing in as much as her 5-foot-2, 95-pound frame can handle.

Through it all, she gives public talks. On this day, that's at a TEDx event in Encinitas, a beachside community 100 miles south of her apartment in LA's Venice Beach.

We'd arranged to take the train down for the event. But she'd been fighting a fever as high as 103 the day before, the result of one of many infections her body continuously fights. When I offer to drive instead, she seems relieved. I am, too.

She's chatty and bubbly for most of the two-plus-hour trip, until she feels the fever coming back and curls up in the passenger seat for a nap. The only sound from her now is an occasional cough and the pumping of a portable oxygen concentrator, which gives her the air she needs without the burden of a tank. When I glance over, I spot a tattoo on her left ankle: the ""thumbs up"" logo from ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,"" with the phrase ""DON'T PANIC.""

But I start to do so when she wakes up and says her lungs feel ""funny."" At the venue, she makes her way to the ""green room,"" where she sits, eyes closed, willing stomach pains to subside, trying to pull it together. She's set to go on in 20 minutes, and I'm afraid she won't make it.

More than a sick kid

She's been riveting audiences since she was 14, when she first stepped on a stage in a new ruffled dress. When I picked her up at her apartment, she wore faded black jeans and a black T-shirt that read ""Sexual Intellectual.""

""Life is too short to not be yourself,"" she said.

Ever since she was little, she found it strange how people treated her. They'd peer down with sad eyes and say, ""I'm so sorry."" It was a statement she heard so often, it was hard not to internalize. And in a society consumed with being healthy, she grew confused.

""What happens when you have an illness where you're never going to be healthy?"" she asked. ""Does that mean I'm never going to have a life? Am I never going to do anything or be anything other than a sick kid?""

Claire is one of 70,000 people worldwide, 30,000 in the United States alone, who live with cystic fibrosis, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation estimates. To have the disease, both parents must be carriers of the CF gene. If they are, there's a one in four chance their children will be born with the disease.

Cystic fibrosis leads to an overabundance of mucus, which blocks airways and traps infections in the lungs, complicates digestion, affects the pancreas and other organs and, with time, causes respiratory failure.

At last count, Claire says, she's had more than 30 surgeries. On a daily basis, she takes about four dozen medications, including self-administered shots for her CF-related diabetes, and might spend up to six hours on breathing treatments.

She dons a vest to shake her lungs and loosen mucus, and uses a nebulizer to blow in steam and inhale medicines. She can cough up enough mucus each day to measure in cups. She gets admitted to the hospital for regular tuneups and intensive treatments.

All the while, with her lung capacity diminished, her body works harder to breathe.

""It's like I'm jogging 24/7,"" she said. She must consume as many as 5,000 calories a day to maintain her weight -- forget about gaining any.

That explains the two large pastries she ordered for lunch when we met, and the French fries she got to go. And it's why her younger sister, Elanore Nordquist, 13, used to get miffed whenever she wasn't allowed a second piece of cake but Claire could always have as much as she wanted.

Even with this carte blanche for consumption, Claire takes in 2,000 calories through a feeding tube as she sleeps, while a machine helps her breathe so her body can rest.

Pineapples and mushrooms

Claire can laugh at the absurdities in her life. She tells stories of strangers who've approached her with unsolicited prescriptions for cures. The produce section of Whole Foods is ripe for material, she says. One shopper told her she simply needed to eat more pineapple. Another said all she required was a mushroom cleanse.

And then there was the homeless guy outside a gas station who insisted that the mind can change reality and that she didn't need to be sick. She remembered thinking, with a laugh, ""If that's true, why are you homeless?""

But it was a friend who, when Claire was 11, changed her outlook by handing her a book he insisted she see.

Claire has always welcomed chances to escape Los Angeles and breathe cleaner air. Here, she visits Vancouver, British Columbia, several years ago.

It was Stephen Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time."" The cosmology book blew her young and curious mind, and she rushed to the library to learn more about its author. Only then did she find out that Hawking had ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease, and was terminally ill, too.

Until that moment, Claire -- an avid reader -- had yet to find any role models, examples of sick people doing remarkable things.

""His body was completely failing, but he was contributing something incredible to society,"" she said. Hawking's diagnosis did not define him. ""He transcended it.""

In him, she found inspiration, though it would take a steep downturn for her to see her way up.

Flatlining

The sicker a person with cystic fibrosis gets, the more work they need to do to stay relatively well -- and the harder it is to do that work. It's enough to make some ""CFers,"" as Claire calls them, stop trying.

She gets it because she was once there.

""It's not that I wanted to die,"" she said. ""But I didn't know how to live.""

At 12, she feared that she was surviving just to survive.

During a hospital stay, she had become close friends with Vanessa, another girl with cystic fibrosis. CFers aren't supposed to be together, as they carry bacteria that can be deadly if shared. But these two girls connected at a safe distance, doing art projects across the room while wearing protective masks. They made disco balls for the nursing station out of crushed CDs and glue, shared an understanding and a sense of humor and, over the course of a year and a half, a deep friendship. And then, Vanessa died.

Bereft and facing a lifetime of treatments, Claire asked herself, ""Why am I doing this?""

Claire and her sister, Elanore Nordquist, cuddle the night before Claire moves out of the house. One of the things Claire appreciates most about Elanore is that she's never treated Claire like a sick person.

So she began to lie, saying she took her medications and treatments when she didn't. For a year, her health slipped, and she said no one could figure out why. Claire, who'd always peppered her doctors and nurses with questions, knew the language and how to trick everyone.

The day after her 13th birthday, a straightforward surgery to deal with acid reflux spiraled into chaos. She contracted a blood infection that attacked her lungs. She could feel them failing.

As her oxygen levels plummeted, she began hallucinating. In a moment of clarity, she thought, ""I don't want to actually die. I want to see what happens in life. I want to see where it goes.""

She was placed in a medically induced coma, intubated and hooked up to an oscillator, a machine that gently puffed air into her fragile lungs. No child with CF had successfully come off an oscillator, doctors told her parents. Claire says she was given a 1% chance of survival. She flatlined twice.

Her little sister was 6 at the time. Elanore remembers a social worker talking to her before she went in -- ""all sanitized and in a gown"" -- to see Claire.

""They told me to say goodbye,"" Elanore said. ""They told me 'she's probably not going to wake up.' ""

A winter wonderland

There was no white light. Instead, Claire transported herself to a place she'd never been: Alaska.

Her subconscious journey began beneath ice water, she says. When she surfaced, she peered up at a mountain of snow. She sat amid ice-crystal-covered pine trees, floated on ice sheets while looking up at stars and hung out in a woodland house where animals streamed in to visit her.

After her coma, Claire traveled to Sitka, Alaska, the place she believes she subconciously visited.

Claire remained in a coma for more than two weeks. When she woke up, she learned that her dream world had unfolded while she had been submerged in an ice bath to bring down her fever.

Though conscious again, she couldn't walk, sit up or hold silverware. She had to wear diapers. Her mom called her ""Grandpa,"" a memory that still makes her laugh.

""My body had no reserves left,"" she said. ""It was kaput.""

In the many months she worked to get stronger, she found renewed purpose.

""I feel like she had a spiritual experience,"" said her mom, Melissa Nordquist Yeager. ""She came out inspired to help others.""

Finding meaning by giving back

Claire entered the world the way she lives: boldly.

Yeager was overdue to give birth to her firstborn when a routine ultrasound morphed into a scene of terror.

She watched the doctor's face as he studied the screen. He ducked out and returned with another doctor. They told her that something was wrong with the baby and that Yeager had to be induced immediately.

Claire was born with meconium ileus, a bowel obstruction that is a telltale sign of CF. Her bowel had ruptured, leaving her belly protruded, and she was whisked off for the first of many surgeries.

""The prognosis was five years,"" Yeager said, ""and that was a maybe.""

Claire spent the next seven weeks in neonatal intensive care. Her father, John Wineland, recalls peering down at his daughter as she screamed amid the medical equipment and tubes. Their eyes locked.

""It's going to be OK,"" he remembers telling her. ""We're in this together.""

Just like that, Claire's parents, who then lived in Austin, Texas, were jolted from naivetÃÂ©.

Claire has spent a quarter of her life in the hospital, mostly at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center in California, where her medical team is just like family.

Raising a daughter with CF ""has consumed most of my attention, most of my life,"" said Yeager, who now lives in Seal Beach, California. She and Wineland, of Santa Monica, never married and decided to split when Claire was 3, but they remained close friends and have continued to tackle Claire's care together.

With Claire in the hospital two or three months a year, Yeager never felt that she could build a career. She lost a handful of jobs and quit others as hospital stays dictated. She'd take the day shifts with Claire while Wineland took nights. He'd hunker down next to Claire in the hospital, watch movies with her at 3 a.m. when she couldn't sleep, and head to work in the morning.

All the while, Claire's parents -- and, by extension, Claire -- were surrounded by friends. They'd come to the hospital with meals, stick around when her parents couldn't, help rally the family and manage their lives. They also helped make Claire more outgoing and sociable, her dad says.

Claire grew up knowing that she and her parents were fortunate, that too many families lacked the support they had. After waking from her 16-day coma, Claire proposed starting an organization to offer financial and emotional help to others navigating life with CF.

Whether it's covering rents, mortgages, insurance premiums or car payments, Claire's Place Foundation aims to relieve pressure when CFers are hospitalized so families can focus on what matters most. Not long ago, it even helped find an apartment for a homeless CFer who was floating between shelters.

What started as ""a side project to celebrate (Claire's) life and survival became a passion of all of ours,"" said Yeager, who serves as the executive director.

And for Claire, the foundation changed everything.

""All throughout my teenage years, I was able to hold on to the foundation as a means to remind me that I had value,"" she said. ""It's important for people who are sick to feel empowered. It gives them reason to take care of themselves.""

Don't touch her sushi

In high school, Claire launched The Clairity Project , a website offering insight into her life, including videos that became popular on YouTube.

She offered honest talk with a smile about dying, life expectancy, even the perks of being sick. She gave tips on how to interact with sick people, answered questions she's often asked and introduced her family . She and her father, on guitar, performed together, singing Bob Dylan's ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door.""

She stepped away from making videos after no longer seeing eye-to-eye with a production company that got involved. Instead, she decided to focus on what she could control and feel good about: the foundation and her speaking engagements.

She also embarked on a new phase: Since graduating high school, she's lived on her own with a roommate in Venice Beach.

A 2015 trip to Europe with childhood friend Alicia Schomer, who says Claire has changed her: ""I'm not as terrifed of the thought of death anymore, but I am terrified of not living life to the fullest.""

It can be hard for any parent when a child leaves the nest, but for Claire's mom, the transition has been even more fraught.

Yeager knows how much work goes into Claire's care and worries that her daughter won't ask for help.

""I'm happy for her, and I know she's capable,"" her mother said. ""But I just see how sick she's getting.""

A year ago, Claire was at 50% lung capacity, Yeager says. Today, she's at 30%. She must take antibiotics to beat back recurring infections, which have become resistant to most of the drugs.

And when she turned 18 and could decide for herself, Claire announced that she wasn't interested in being on the list for a double lung transplant.

""I had to be honest,"" she said. ""It's not for me and never has been.""

Though transplants can extend a life, they're no cure. She'd have to live on steroids, which she hates taking. She'd run the risk of developing new issues when she's used to the ones she has. Plus, her body could reject the new lungs.

""And you can't eat sushi afterwards. That's a no,"" quipped Claire, who says she'd spend hundreds of dollars a month on sushi alone, if she could.

Therapies developed in trials are now helping many CFers, according to the She insists that she's not giving up, though. Instead of opting for a transplant, she's holding out hope for a cure. If she got new lungs, she says, she wouldn't qualify for drugs in development.Therapies developed in trials are now helping many CFers, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation , and eventually, with other clinical trials now underway, as many as 95% of CFers could benefit.

Her decision was a blow to her parents. They've had to accept that she won't pursue an option that could give her another 10 years.

""Just think of it as insurance, even if you don't want to do it,"" her mom pleaded at first. ""Get on the list so you can change your mind.""

But Yeager, no matter how uncomfortable it makes her, knows to trust her daughter's intuition.

""She has a relationship with her body that is sacred,"" explains her dad, who, like Claire, is a practicing Buddhist. Claire's thinking, he said: ""This is the body I came in with. This is the body I'm going out with.""

And as her father, ""I have to live with it.""

Claire, unplugged

Claire is Wineland's only child. He says she's helped him become a better person.

He's learned ""to not be afraid of what hasn't happened yet"" and believes that Claire is exactly how she's supposed to be. He's learned to ""love what is.""

At 51, he finds comfort in meditation and yoga, which Claire practiced for years, before her coma.

Wineland is a life and relationship coach. Together, he and Claire have explored ways to grow spiritually. When Claire was 10, he says, she walked on fire at a retreat run by motivational speaker Tony Robbins. He's had to figure out healthy ways to deal with pain, even to see the beauty in it.

""When you don't know what's going to happen to your only child,"" he says, ""it can be pretty debilitating.""

Claire's parents, Melissa Nordquist Yeager and John Wineland, split when Claire was 3 but remain close friends and partners when it comes to her care.

Humor has also helped him cope. When there's a long line at a restaurant, he says, he'll sometimes send her to the front of the line coughing to play ""the sick-kid card.""

Yeager too marvels at what Claire's done for her. She says her daughter's aura and energy lift those around her, making Claire ""a force of nature.""

During a recent hospital stay, mother and daughter were talking about death, a subject they don't shy away from.

""After you die, you're closer to everyone you love, because you're part of everything,"" Yeager remembers Claire saying. The words were a gift, a reminder that her daughter's essence will remain always, even after she's gone.

""If and when it does happen,"" Yeager said, ""I'm never going to forget her saying that.""

Elanore, Claire's only sibling, is more no-nonsense. She never treated Claire differently, a fact Claire has always treasured.

""She couldn't care less that I was sick, which I loved,"" Claire says. ""It was refreshing.""

When she was younger, Elanore cared so little that sometimes she'd even unplug Claire's oxygen without telling anyone.

""We wrestled a lot,"" Claire remembers with a laugh. ""She'd unplug it to make me tired so she could win.""

She gets how sick Claire is today. Still, she doesn't see Claire as a sick person.

""She's just a person,"" Elanore says. ""She's not all-knowing. She's still figuring it out, like a lot of people. ... She needs the freedom to be a 20-year-old.""

'It's OK to feel pain'

Though Claire had been attending Santa Monica College, part of her freedom meant putting school on hold.

""Truth be told, I probably wouldn't make it to graduation,"" she said. ""I feel my body changing, and I had to make an executive decision.""

Instead, she's focusing on what she can accomplish now -- including a new partnership with Zappos for Good to make hospitals more, well, hospitable. She's designing the renovation and decoration of a playroom and intensive care rooms at the Children's Hospital of Nevada at UMC in Las Vegas, which Zappos will pay for. The partnership began after Claire addressed about 2,000 people at the company in November.

Calling her ""super inspiring,"" Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh said, ""I'm pretty sure she brought tears to most of the people in the room.""

What her Zappos audience didn't know that day was how awful Claire felt.

Over the past couple years, she's had more bad days than good. And in Claire's world, that can't stop her. If she bowed out whenever she felt under the weather, she says, she'd never accomplish a thing.

It's like that again today as she sits in the green room in Encinitas, the TEDx audience awaiting her talk.

The venue is a large meeting space behind a vegan restaurant. Attendees sip kombucha on tap and exchange hugs that last extra beats. When someone asks whether there's a yoga instructor in the room, they raise their hands en masse. Outside in the hallway are pieces of self-help literature, an announcement for a festival ""dedicated to the Divine Goddess"" and business cards for a spiritual medium.

When I peek in on Claire, I grow worried. The room is dark, and her eyes are closed, her arms folded across her belly. I fight every protective instinct to whisk her off and take her home.

Instead, she rallies.

As the emcee introduces her, Claire stands tall, showing no sign of pain or discomfort. She strides toward the stage amid applause, her smile wide. If not for the pumping oxygen concentrator slung over her shoulder, strangers might not suspect that anything's wrong.

She jumps in and talks about the fear she had when she first spoke publicly, the guilt she felt whenever she landed in the hospital, the isolation CFers often feel. She also speaks of what inspires her and her understanding that illness shouldn't stop anyone from living proudly.

""It's OK to feel pain and experience it,"" she says. ""I'm not trying to fix myself. My suffering has given me so much.""

For about 18 minutes, she sets out to change how people think.

When she's done, the crowd stands and applauds. Some audience members hoot and holler. As she weaves through the crowd toward the exit, I chase after her, overhearing whispers like, ""What a gem.""

It's clear people would like to talk to her, hug her, corner her for conversation. She shoots me a glance, though, that says, ""Let's get out of here.""

Claire has given all she can, and she knows she'll pay a price.

The price

In the weeks that follow, Claire can't shake that infection. Then, in mid-June, an ambulance rushes her to the ER: Her fever is back at 103, her heart rate is at 185, and her white blood cell count is 30,000. Claire's oxygen saturation levels are falling, a sign of lung failure.

Not since the scare that landed her in a coma six years earlier has the situation felt so dire, her mother says.

For a few days, Claire only gets worse. She's transported to Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, where the staff feels like family. She has sepsis and a severe case of pneumonia and spends a week in intensive care. Doctors come close to putting her on a ventilator when one of the only two antibiotics that still work for her kick in.

""I thought this was it,"" Yeager says. ""It was an eye-opener for all of us.""

It's too early to know how much of a toll this setback will take on Claire, who is expected to head home from the hospital Wednesday.

""We think of Claire as invincible,"" her mother says, ""and this was a reminder.""

A reminder of how important it is to live each moment fully. A reminder of the lessons Claire still hopes to teach before it's too late."

http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/south-africa-hotel-silo/index.html,SILO IN CAPE TOWN: IS THIS AFRICA'S BEST NEW HOTEL? - CNN.COM,"Travis Levius, CNN Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Updated 21st June 2017

(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Grain storage buildings never looked so fabulous.

Cape Town's The Silo Hotel -- named after the former grain-silo complex in which it is housed -- opened its doors in March as an instant Cape Town landmark.

From the outside, it's an industrial monolith with a standout set of 25-feet-high convex windows overlooking the popular V&A Waterfront. The inside, by contrast, is a riot of color, pattern and glamor, with 28 individually designed rooms stocked with vibrant custom furnishings, oversized chandeliers and feature artworks.

Africa's most expensive city hotel (rooms start at about $900 in the low season) is based six floors above the soon-to-open Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa ( Zeitz MOCAA ) -- touted to become Cape Town's answer to Le Louvre and the Tate Modern -- and features a spa, a panoramic rooftop bar with swimming pool and The Vault, the hotel's very own private gallery of African contemporary artists in the building's basement.













1 / 7 The Silo Hotel: Once a grain-silo complex, the industrial monolith has been transformed into Cape Town's most expensive hotel as well as a soon-to-open world-class art museum.

Glowing beacon

The original silo building was completed in 1924, and at nearly 200 feet high, once held the title as sub-Saharan Africa's tallest building. It was the premier grain silo for all of South Africa, where all of the country's small farmers' yields were deposited for export.

When the silo complex closed its operations in 2001, South African hotelier Liz Biden saw a future opportunity.

""We have always wanted to open a hotel in our home city of Cape Town but we were waiting for the perfect property and opportunity to arise,"" says Biden, whose hotel collection, the Royal Portfolio , features some of South Africa's most luxurious lodgings.

Architect Thomas Heatherwick is behind the redesign of The Silo's exterior.

It took four and a half years for the collaborative vision between Biden, the V&A Waterfront complex and London-based starchitect Thomas Heatherwick to come to life, with the hotel now occupying the former elevator portion of the silo (the upcoming art museum is a separate operation from the hotel).

Heatherwick spearheaded the exterior revamp, which had to be done carefully to preserve the complex's heritage status. Thus, the building retains its austere appearance save for the show-stopping geodesic window installations, which ""billow"" up to three feet out from the building's facade.

""Heatherwick wanted the redeveloped building to appear as if it were gently inflated like a glowing beacon in the harbor,"" Biden says.

Welcoming space

Bathrooms are the highlight of the rooms in The Silo .

The Silo Hotel's glass-and-concrete construct is a far departure from Biden's colorful, eclectic aesthetic seen in all her other properties.

""Designing the interiors of The Silo Hotel has been a complicated task,"" Biden admits, needing to work around the building's limited space and original interiors. ""I have tried to contrast the stark exterior of the building with warm colors, vibrant fabrics, exciting ornaments, and contemporary art to create a lively and welcoming space.""

The rooms and suites have Biden's signature eccentric, elegant look -- assorted bric-a-brac inspired from personal travels; color-blocked interiors where you might find handmade teal headboards alongside bubblegum pink dressers; Persian carpets; Egyptian crystal chandeliers (there are 80 in the hotel) and painted portraits by Africa's premiere artists such as Frances Goodman and Jody Paulsen.

The rooms' highlights are the bathrooms, each expansive in size with a large tub set dramatically in the middle of a 56-paneled window -- with a crystal chandelier dangling gracefully from above.

Most of the furnishings and art pieces were custom-made in Cape Town, with very few elements from outside the country. Ardmore, a premium Durban-based ceramics company, teamed with Biden to make patterned headboards and pillows in select spaces. The hotel's high-ceilinged lobby is dominated by local Haldane Martin's structural Tesla chandelier.

The inclusion of contemporary works from artists such as Kenya-born Cyrus Kabiru in the corridors suggests a ""blending"" into the space below the hotel which in September will house the largest collection of African contemporary art.

""We are extremely happy to be situated above the museum [Zeitz MOCAA] which will be a remarkable attraction for Cape Town and for South Africa. It really will be something special,"" Biden says.

""We must be the only hotel in the world situated directly above such a prestigious art museum.""

Hottest hangout

The Willaston Bar features velvety jewel-toned booths with views of Cape Town's iconic Table Mountain.

As luxurious as The Silo's rooms and suites might be, many might find the nightly rates to be a tad exorbitant for an urban South Africa hotel, with the entry-level Silo Rooms starting at 12,000 ZAR (about $940) per night in the low season for a 441 square feet room with balcony.

The gated 13-bedroom mansion hotel Ellerman House, perhaps The Silo's main ""best African hotel"" competitor also based in Cape Town, has comparable rates yet is more exclusive -- its cliffside lap pool, restaurant, spa and owner-curated contemporary private art gallery are only open to guests and their companions.

For those who can't afford a stay in Africa's most expensive city hotel, there's always the restaurant and bar options.

The Willaston Bar and Granary Cafe are based on the sixth-floor reception level, the former a vision of velvety jewel-toned booths with floor-to-ceiling window views of Cape Town's iconic flat-top mountain.

The Granary Cafe is an informal dining space led by star South African chef Veronica Canha-Hibbert, and features a small raw bar selection, dishes such as steak frites and confit pork belly and a European-style Sunday Lunch menu.

The rooftop lounge/bar and swimming pool -- with uninhibited 360-degree views of the urban landscape, the formidable Table Mountain, harbor and the Atlantic Ocean -- are unsurprisingly in-demand during those sundowner hours, making The Silo Cape Town's hottest hotel hangout of the moment."

(CNN) Angela Merkel can teach the American President a thing or two about international diplomacy.

The year was 2005, and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair was still a political superstar on the international stage.

The then-leader of the German opposition, Angela Merkel, was a generally underestimated politician who was destined to become leader of her country. Blair knew this. That is why he met her. But Merkel did not stick to the polite platitudes. She cut straight to the chase.

""I have 10 problems,"" said Angela Merkel -- and then began to list them, starting with her own lack of charisma. This was how Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair's chief of staff, remembered Merkel's first encounter with her British colleague.

Merkel was humbled by the task of becoming Chancellor of Germany -- the most powerful political position in Europe. And she was not too proud to ask Tony Blair for advice.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-turkey-idUSKBN19V1MQ,TILLERSON SAYS U.S. AND TURKEY STARTING TO MEND RELATIONS,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The Trump administration is starting to repair ties with NATO ally Turkey, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Monday, without acknowledging Washington still pursued some policies that have been the focus of tension. Tillersons comments came a day after he met Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan for talks on regional security issues, including U.S. backing for Kurdish Syrian YPG forces fighting to drive Islamic State from their Raqqa stronghold. ""I think we're beginning to rebuild some of that trust that we lost in one another. They lost our trust to a certain extent, we lost theirs,"" Tillerson, in Istanbul for an international petroleum conference, told U.S. consulate staff members.  Turkey views the YPG as a branch of the PKK, the outlawed Kurdish separatist group that has been waging an insurgency in southeastern Turkey since the 1980s. It fears an effort to form a contiguous Kurdish state embracing some Turkish territory. Ankara was infuriated last month when Washington  which has designated the PKK a terrorist group - announced that it would continue the Obama administrations policy of arming the YPG, although U.S. officials insist that the United States will retrieve the weapons once Islamic State is defeated. The Trump administration also has persisted in resisting Turkeys demand that it extradite Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic cleric who lives in Pennsylvania and is accused by Erdogan of masterminding a failed military coup in July 2016. A decision by U.S. prosecutors last month to charge a dozen Turkish security and police officers after an attack on protesters during Erdogan's visit to Washington also angered Ankara. Tillerson made no mention of the continuing disagreements. He said that since becoming Secretary of State he had met Erdogan three times ""and I think each meeting things are getting a little better in terms of the tone between us"". The U.S. relationship with Turkey is ""extraordinarily important from a security standpoint to the future economic opportunities,"" he said, noting the countrys strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and the Middle East. ""(This) is why we must put the relationship on the mend... and I think we're taking the first steps in that regard."" Muslim-majority Turkey has NATOs second-largest standing military and its Incirlik Air Base is critical to U.S. military operations in the Middle East, serving as the base from which the U.S.-led coalition has been staging strikes in support of the offensive being waged against Islamic State in Raqqa by the YPG and Syrian Arab fighters backed by U.S. troops. We're making some progress down in Syria. We're hopeful that we can replicate that with Turkey, on some areas in the north part of Syria. Tillersons comments, however, sharply contrasted with comments by Erdogan two weeks ago, when he harshly criticized the arming of the YPG by the United States. The ones who think they are tricking Turkey by saying they are going to get back the weapons that are being given to this terrorist organization will realize that they are making a mistake eventually,"" he told members of his ruling AK Party. ""But it will be too late for them,"" he added, saying that if violence spilled over Syria's border into Turkey, Ankara would hold to account anyone who supplied arms to the YPG.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-vote-idUSKBN19V29W?il=0,TRUMP'S ELECTION PANEL PUTS HOLD ON VOTER DATA REQUEST,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's commission to investigate possible election fraud on Monday put a freeze on its effort to collect sensitive voter data from states in the face of growing legal challenges. In an email, the panel's designated officer, Andrew Kossack, asked state elections officers to ""hold on submitting any data,"" the commission said in court filings.  Several state elections officials confirmed receiving a letter from the panel stating that it would provide further instructions after a federal judge had ruled on a complaint filed by a watchdog group, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), which is seeking a temporary restraining order. Earlier on Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, alleging violations of federal law requiring transparent government. The bipartisan panel, led by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, asked the 50 U.S. states for a host of voter data, including birth dates and the last four digits of voters' Social Security numbers.  Most U.S. states have rejected full compliance, which many called unnecessary and a violation of privacy.  This has been a misadventure from the get-go,"" Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin, who had refused to give the commission any data, said by phone. In Wisconsin, elections officials halted plans to inform the commission how it could purchase for $12,500 its public voter data, not including Social Security numbers or birth dates.  ""We're just putting everything on hold,"" said Reid Magney, spokesman for the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Arkansas, however, had already sent in a limited batch of publicly available data, according to the office of Secretary of State Mark Martin, In a court document, the government said it would not download the information from Arkansas and would instead delete it. Representatives for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.         The commission last week said it would meet on July 19 in Washington near the White House. On Monday, critics cheered the move and expressed hope the commission would permanently abandon efforts to collect voter data. ""The commission has effectively conceded,"" EPIC President Marc Rotenberg said by phone. State officials from both parties and election experts widely agree that voter fraud is rare. Civil rights groups called the commission a voter suppression tactic by Trump.  The Republican president created the panel in May following his claim, without evidence, that millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missile-un-idUSKBN19V28V,U.S. AIMS FOR U.N. VOTE ON NORTH KOREA SANCTIONS WITHIN WEEKS: DIPLOMATS,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - United States Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley aims to put to a vote within weeks a U.N. Security Council resolution to impose stronger sanctions on North Korea over its long-range ballistic missile test, said several senior U.N. diplomats. Haley told some U.N. diplomats late last week of the ambitious timeline for a U.N. response to North Korea's launch on Tuesday of a missile that some experts believe could have the range to reach Alaska, and parts of the U.S. West Coast.  The U.S. mission to the United Nations declined to comment on the timeline for a council vote. Some Security Council diplomats have expressed doubt that a draft resolution could be put to a vote quickly. Following a nuclear weapons test by North Korea in September, while U.S. President Barack Obama was still in office, it took the U.N. Security Council three months to agree to strengthened sanctions. The United States gave China a draft resolution to impose stronger sanctions on Pyongyang after the 15-member Security Council met on Wednesday to discuss the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launch, diplomats said.  China's U.N. Ambassador Liu Jieyi told Reuters on Monday that it was important to ensure that any action the Security Council might take should be conducive to achieving the goal of a denuclearized, peaceful and stable Korean peninsula. ""We really must think very carefully about what is the best approach in the Security Council because a resolution, sanctions, are themselves not an objective,"" he said. When asked if the council could act within weeks, Liu said it would depend on how members ""see the way forward in terms of council action, in terms of how that is put into the wider context of ... improving the situation, preventing further tests, ensuring Security Council resolutions will be abided by."" Traditionally, the United States and China have negotiated new sanctions on North Korea before formally involving other council members. Diplomats said the United States would informally keep Britain and France in the loop, while China was likely talking to Russia. The United States, China, Russia, Britain and France are the Security Council's permanent veto-wielding powers. The United States could also face a battle to persuade Russia that council action against North Korea is needed. On Thursday, Russia objected to a council condemnation of North Korea's missile launch because the U.S.-drafted statement labeled it an ICBM, a designation Moscow disagrees with. Diplomats said that negotiations on the statement had stalled. North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs and the council has ratcheted up the measures in response to the country's five nuclear weapons tests and two long-range missile launches. During the Security Council meeting last Wednesday, Haley said some options to strengthen U.N. sanctions were to restrict the flow of oil to North Korea's military and weapons programs, increasing air and maritime restrictions and imposing targeted sanctions on senior officials. Diplomats said Washington proposed such options to Beijing two months ago, but that China had not engaged in discussions on the measures and instead only agreed to adding some people and entities to the existing U.N. sanctions list in June.

Korean Air will cooperate with the probe, a representative said, declining to elaborate.Shares of the carrier fell 2.2 percent to 35,900 won in Seoul after tumbling as much as 4 percent earlier on news of the raid. No charges have been laid in the investigation.During his election campaign, Moon had pledged to reform the family-run mega-corporations -- locally called chaebol -- saying an economic strategy focused on these groups caused low wage growth and joblessness. After taking office, Moon appointed a shareholder activist Kim Sang-jo as head of the Fair Trade Commission to closely oversee these business groups.An influence-peddling scandal involving some of these companies led to the impeachment of his predecessor and the indictment of Jay Y. Lee, vice-chairman of Samsung Electronics Co. Lee, the de-facto head of the Samsung group, is fighting the charges. In a separate case, some Lotte Group family members face criminal charges ranging from embezzlement to fiduciary breaches amounting to about 280 billion won ($243 million). All of them have denied wrongdoing.In his May 10 inaugural speech, Moon reaffirmed his intention to get tough on the chaebol, vowing to cut ties between the government and business groups. Before he was elected, his political party couldnt generate enough support for legislation that would have limited the power held by the handful of rich families behind the empires. Now that he runs the government, he can issue executive orders and bypass parliamentary resistance.The raid at Korean Air office was carried out between 9 a.m. and 12 p.m. local time, a police official said, adding contracts and other accounting documents were seized for scrutiny."

LaBeouf, 31, was taken into custody around 4 a.m., and was released later Saturday from Chatham County Detention Center after posting a $7,000 bond, the Chatham County Sheriff's Office said.

The actor approached a bystander and a police officer asking for a cigarette, according to a statement from the Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police Department. He became disorderly, using profanities and vulgar language, when he wasn't given a cigarette, it said.

He was told to leave the area but refused and became aggressive toward the officer, police said.

Thanks to its fruity and powerfully hopped American-style IPAs, and its can designs by Nick Dwyer inspired by 1950s sci-fi comic books , Beavertown Brewery has become the purveyor of London's most stylish tipples. They're never better -- or cheaper -- than from the source -- in the brewery's on-site taproom in an industrial park in unfashionable Tottenham Hale.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/11/asia/india-japan-us-malabar-exercises/index.html,"US, INDIA AND JAPAN BEGIN NAVAL EXERCISES, AS CHINA LOOKS ON","New Delhi (CNN) A rising Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean has prompted the largest naval exercise the region has seen in more than two decades.

The United States, Japan and India have deployed front-line warships, submarines and aircraft as part of the tri-nation Malabar exercises in the Bay of Bengal.

Conducted annually since 1992, Malabar has grown in size and complexity in recent years to address what the US Navy describes as a ""variety of shared threats to maritime security in the Indo-Asia Pacific.""

Formerly a bilateral exercise between India and the US, this year's drill is only the second to include Japan -- and the first to include aircraft carriers from all three navies.

The exercises, which officially began Monday, are intended to provide a ""symbolic reassurance that the US is committed to working with India to continue shaping the Asian security environment,"" said Constantino Xavier, a foreign policy specialist at Carnegie India.

The week-long series of war games will involve a total of 16 ships -- including the nuclear-powered USS Nimitz, India's INS Vikramanditya, a reconditioned Russian-built aircraft carrier, and Japan's JS Izumo, a helicopter carrier with an emphasis on anti-submarine warfare -- as well as two submarines and more than 95 aircraft.

The aircraft carrier USS Nimitz (CVN 68) anchors off the coast of India in preparation for Malabar 2017.

Rising China

The buildup of naval power in the region comes at a time of increased tensions between India and China.

China has steadily increased its naval presence throughout the Indian Ocean in recent years, part of an assertive blue-water strategy that aims to extend the country's operating ability far from Chinese shores.

According to an IndiaSpend analysis of publicly available data, China's People's Liberation Army Navy (PLA-N) has 283 major surface combatant warships, four times more than those under the control of the Indian Navy (66).

Delhi has long viewed the India Ocean as part of its immediate sphere of influence. The expansion of China's naval power -- and its submarine fleet in particular -- has forced Indian leaders to reevaluate the country's coastal defense policy. The Indian Navy has reported at least a dozen sightings of Chinese vessels in the region since May , including submarines.

This year's Malabar exercises will for the first time include exchanges on anti-submarine warfare, patrol and reconnaissance, according to the US Navy.

The Indian Navy has also sent its Sindhughosh class submarine and a P-81 long range maritime surveillance aircraft, underscoring the exercise's anti-submarine focus.

Ten years ago many Indians believed in China's pronouncement that it would be a different kind of world power, one whose power rests on economic development, said Xavier. ""But today, the question in Delhi is not whether China is a threat, but rather, how do we best address this threat?""

Though not a part of Indian territory, the plateau holds immense strategic importance for Delhi and is vital to its geopolitical interests.

Elsewhere, China's close ties with Pakistan -- the two countries recently agreed a deal that gives China access to Pakistan's Gwadar Port -- as well as the construction of China's first overseas military base in Djibouti have added to Delhi's military concerns.

In response to a question relating to Malabar Friday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that China had ""no objection to the development of normal relations and cooperation between countries.""

Global maritime community

India has recently begun to take a more active role in working with regional partners to contain China's influence. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's trip to the US in June , along with the US sale of surveillance drones to the Indian Navy, reaffirmed the two counties' relationship.

And in June, US defense giant Lockheed Martin said it would build F-16 fighter jets in India if Delhi signs an order for as many as 150 of the single-engine warplanes.

Jets take off from the deck of the USS Nimitz.

That sense of openness will likely strike a chord in Beijing. The Bay of Bengal, where the Malabar exercise is taking place, is a strategically important waterway for China, due to its proximity to the Strait of Malacca.

""The Chinese depend fundamentally on the Strait of Malacca (the main shipping channel connecting the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea) for their commerce, trade, export and access to oil in the Middle East,"" said Xavier.

The Indian administered Andaman and Nicobar archipelago, several hundred miles northwest of the Strait of Malacca, provides India with a degree of territorial and strategic leverage over China.

""If they (the Chinese) are choked, if they're not allowed to use that sea line of communication, if the Indians and Japanese start pushing for control of that (the Strait of Malacca), the Chinese will have to look at alternate routes, and that's what they're doing, with the whole belt and road initiative.""

Notably, both India and Japan have declined to participate in China's One Belt, One Road project -- an ambitious series of interlinking trade deals and infrastructure projects throughout Eurasia and the Pacific.

Key events planned during the at-sea portions of the Malabar exercises include submarine familiarization, air defense exercises, surface warfare exercises and anti-submarine warfare, according to the US Navy.

While China will be watching carefully, the exercises are not likely to tip the balance of power in the region. ""It's a cat-and-mouse game,"" said Bharat Karnad, a professor at the Centre for Policy Resesarch in Delhi. ""It's always ongoing."""

http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/06/health/charlie-gard-us-laws/index.html,CHARLIE GARD: COULD THIS CASE HAPPEN IN THE US?,"(CNN) A beautiful boy born 11 months ago is dying in London. The world watches as his parents battle to keep their child alive. Courts will not allow the hospital to release the baby, Charlie Gard, into the parents' custody so they can travel to try an experimental treatment.

Across the ocean, many people are appalled or confused, and wondering: Could a similar situation happen in the United States?

""It's an absolutely horrific situation,"" said Claire Fenton-Glynn, a legal scholar at the University of Cambridge.

Yet according to some medical ethicists, similar cases happen all the time.

The case of Charlie Gard

Charlie was born with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, a rare condition involving weakened muscles and organ dysfunction, among other symptoms. Because Charlie's prognosis is so poor, his doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London want to take him off life support. Charlie has no hope of surviving, they say, and he should be allowed to die in dignity.

Charlie's parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates, found a doctor in the United States who is offering an experimental treatment. They want the hospital to release their baby so they can take him to the United States.

The battle has gone to the courts.

""How do you decide what is in the best interest of the child? The only way to do that is to gather as much information as possible,"" Fenton-Glynn said.

A judge talked to Charlie's parents and Charlie's doctors. The American doctor as well as independent experts were consulted. Generally, the courts ""followed the same rules that they have always followed in relation to medical treatment for children,"" Fenton-Glynn said.

""The parents' advocate was saying the parents' choice should be respected unless you can show that their choice would cause the child significant harm,"" she said. That argument -- despite its appeal to many Americans -- fell on deaf ears in the UK, where Charlie's best interests remained the solo concern.

The judges concluded that the experimental treatment would be ""futile,"" Fenton-Glynn said. ""There's no evidence that it would provide benefit to the child.""

Courts, including the UK Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights in France, agreed with the hospital. The European court ruled June 27 that the hospital could discontinue Charlie's life support.

Since then, US President Donald Trump and Pope Francis have offered help to Charlie and his parents. A Vatican-owned pediatric hospital in Rome offered to bring the boy into its care. The London hospital told Vatican officials this week that it's not able to legally transfer the child.

In the United Kingdom, when parents and doctors dispute what is appropriate medical care, ""it is up to the court to decide -- on a purely objective basis -- what is in the best interest of the child,"" Fenton-Glynn said.

'Unlikely' situation for the United States

Although a Charlie Gard case could happen in the United States, ""it seems unlikely,"" said Dr. John D. Lantos, director of Bioethics Center at Children's Mercy Kansas City.

Similar cases in the US, such as Jahi McMath's, tend to be resolved in favor of parental rights, he explained.

Jahi, a 13-year old-girl , entered Children's Hospital Oakland in California in 2013 for a routine tonsillectomy. After that surgery, Jahi suffered cardiac arrest and excessive bleeding. She was placed on life support and soon declared legally brain-dead.

JUST WATCHED Dying baby from U.K at center of life-support debate Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Dying baby from U.K at center of life-support debate 04:28

""All the doctors agreed that (Jahi) met the criteria for being brain-dead,"" Lantos said. ""The courts said, 'Yeah, we respect the doctors' opinion, but if the parents want to pay for her treatment and take her to a different place, we'll let 'em.' And they did. And she is still alive.""

The more common situation in the US is ""where the courts are ordering treatment,"" he said.

It happens, for example, because of religious beliefs, when parents don't want their child to get a blood transfusion. Or when parents refuse the standard, proven treatment in order to try an experimental treatment. In such situations, courts may step in and take protective custody and order the treatment, Lantos said.

American courts ""don't usually do the opposite and say that 'parents who want to keep their child alive are making a decision contrary to the child's interests, because the child would be better off dead, so we're going to overrule the parents,' "" he said. ""Even when a child met the criteria for brain death,"" the courts allowed the parents to seek care, he added.

One famous exception is the case of Terri Schiavo, a woman who suffered cardiac arrest resulting in brain damage in 1990. The US Supreme Court upheld her husband's decision to withdraw life support, despite her parents' objections. She died in 2005 at age 41.

Still, a key aspect of the Charlie Gard case is that there is no question of the parents ""being loving, devoted, attentive, caring people,"" Lantos said.

Sometimes, parents are not visiting their child frequently, are on drugs or are simply not showing themselves to be devoted, caring parents, Lantos said, ""but in (the Charlie Gard) case, the judge went out of his way to praise the parents for their commitment and attentiveness.""

What most Americans found unusual ""and perhaps radical about (the Charlie Gard) decision was, the family wasn't asking the hospital to continue treatment or the National Health Service to pay for it. They said, 'We have the money. We have a doctor in the US who's willing to do it. Just let us go,' "" Lantos said. ""And the courts essentially said, 'Nope, we're not even going to let you go.' ""

English law, explained Fenton-Glynn, does not see parents as having the ""right"" to make decisions on behalf of their children. ""The concept is called parental responsibility: That is, the parent has a responsibility to make decisions, to look after the child,"" she said. ""Parenthood doesn't give them rights; parenthood gives them responsibilities.""

Discretion or rights?

Seema Shah, a lawyer and ethicist who is a faculty member at the Treuman Katz Center for Pediatric Bioethics at Seattle Children's Research Institute, explained that US courts consider ""parental discretion,"" not parental responsibility.

American parents have ""discretion to make decisions"" on behalf of their children, Shah said, ""up to the point where their decisions are going to cause harm to their children.""

Many Americans see it as their ""right,"" she said. Legally, though, US courts are following the same best-interest standard as the UK, but the way it works here, at least in practice, is that ""courts are deferring to parents,"" Shah said.

American courts recognize that parents have values and that parents understand their children, even if this does not give parents rights to do whatever they want, Shah explained.

Still, from state to state, ""there's a lot of variability in practice,"" she said. It's not so much a matter of differences in state laws, it's more a matter of ""different parents make different decisions, and courts and hospitals accommodate those more or less in different states,"" she said.

So, although some children in the US are born with inherited diseases, just like Charlie, their lives look very different from his, Shah said. In America, these babies ""receive care from hospitals willing to accommodate parents who want their children to live as long as possible -- with their suffering minimized, of course,"" she said.

""Wrenching"" is how Shah describes Charlie's case. A lot of detail has not been made public, such as ""the pain doctors expect that Charlie's in,"" she said. ""He's likely sedated to the point where he's not feeling a lot of pain. Still, the procedures he's undergoing may be painful and unpleasant.""

Shah also believes the judge ""might be worried about people taking advantage of desperate parents. The judge clearly struggled with this case.""

""When you look at these cases, what's so hard is, we have to ask ourselves, 'Should we let parents spend a lot of money to take a shot in the dark when the alternative is they will lose their child?' And I don't think there's an easy answer to that question,"" Shah said.

She noted that bioethics and legal principles collide when slow-moving courts must decide cases like Charlie's. Meanwhile, ""the child deteriorates,"" she said. Lacking better processes to resolve disagreements, it's ""delay that makes the decision.""

'A one in a zillion chance?'

""Therapeutic misperception"" is at play in the Charlie Gard case, said Dr. Jeffrey P. Brosco, a professor of clinical pediatrics at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. He's seen this in other bioethical cases and believes cases that closely resemble Charlie's happen stateside all the time.

""Therapeutic misperception is the idea that if there's something that could work, then it probably does work, and 'Yes, I want to be involved with it, and I'm willing to take any chance,' "" said Brosco. ""That seems to be happening here. It certainly was portrayed that way by the courts. You ask a parent, 'Do you want to take a one in a zillion chance?' Most families would say 'Yes.' ""

Though Brosco does not know every detail, he believes from all that he has read that Charlie's situation is one in which ""no more good medical options exist. Where the only thing the medical team is doing, at this point, is causing more pain and suffering,"" he worried.

""Whether it's here, England or Europe, judges have to make these decisions sometimes,"" Brosco said. To head off these situations in South Florida, he said, five hospital ethics committees have joined forces to form a single opinion, presenting a united front whenever a difficult decision must be made.

""It's the whole community of providers that agrees there's only one right thing to do,"" Brosco said.

With different laws in different states and communities rising to the challenges they face, Lantos believes ""the US is too diverse to generalize about.""

Still, when it comes to bioethical matters similar to the Charlie Gard case, ""the state that's been most in the public spotlight is Texas.""

'Even in Texas'

In the 1990s, Baylor University bioethicist Rick Brody began to notice ""some very disturbing cases,"" said Amy McGuire, director of the Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the Baylor College of Medicine.

The cases involved dying patients, where nothing medical could be done to improve their condition, McGuire explained. In each of these cases, a family member was requesting ""continued aggressive life-sustaining treatments, things like multiple amputations,"" she said. ""Things that really the health care professionals felt were a violation of their professional integrity and obligation to their patients.""

Brody and other Baylor faculty put together a task force to devise an ethical approach to deal with such ""futile care.""

They developed and published in 1996 a process-oriented approach: When health care providers believe that a patient request is medically inappropriate, a committee makes a decision. If the members decide that a procedure is futile, doctors can withdraw or refuse treatment against family wishes.

The policy evolved into the Texas Advance Directives Act , which won bipartisan support and was signed into law in 1999 by then-Gov. George W. Bush. A similar process-oriented policy was fashioned for guidelines written by the American Medical Association and published in 1999, McGuire said. The guidelines were not widely adopted by individual states, and recently, she said, the law has sparked controversy and a few unsuccessful challenges.

""Physicians don't have an obligation to offer or to provide medical interventions that are not deemed to be medically inappropriate,"" McGuire said, yet ""all the time,"" people request inappropriate services of doctors.

""For example, does a pediatrician have an obligation to give a baby or a child antibiotics when they're fairly certain that the baby or child has a virus and not a bacterial infection, because the parents are saying, 'I want an antibiotic; my kid is sick'?"" McGuire asked. ""If you provide medical services that are not medically indicated, there could be legal ramifications for that as well.""

The Texas Advance Directives Act amounts to a lot of hoops to jump through, Lantos said, but ""even in Texas, if the parents found a hospital that would take a baby like Charlie Gard,"" the child would probably be transferred.

""Our job as clinical ethicists is to try to help resolve those conflicts before it gets to the point of being so adversarial that nobody can make a decision and the courts have to get involved,"" McGuire said. To prevent gridlock, clinical ethicists negotiate and identify goals of care and try to ""come up with some sort of mediated solution that everybody can feel good about.""

These ""incredibly difficult situations"" are ""best dealt with between family members and health care providers,"" McGuire said. ""We don't want to encourage the politicizing of medical decision-making. I think that would be a very bad direction to go.""

The date when Charlie Gard's life support will be switched off appears to be up in the air, as the hospital is allowing his parents to spend more time with their child. Meanwhile, support from some of the most powerful people in the world -- Trump and the Pope -- has buoyed Charlie's parents.

""The support from the Pope and the President has given us hope. They are traditional men who believe in the family,"" Yates said in a statement. ""They believe in our case and understand why we believe it is right to continue fighting so hard to save Charlie."""

Uber's financial benefactor turned enemy will now have to face Uber's army of lawyers. The transcript of that deposition will no doubt be closely read.In a filing last Thursday, Uber challenged the so-called Apex Doctrine that protects top corporate executives from deposition in cases where lower-level employees have the same facts. Uber's lawyers argued that Page knew of Google's efforts to develop its own ride-hailing service in competition with Uber, a company in which it invested more than $250 million.They also claim that Page knew that his former star engineer, Anthony Levandowski, had downloaded 14,000 proprietary files about self-driving car technology before quitting Waymo. They question why Page never brought it up in subsequent meetings with then-Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. And Uber's filing notes that Page himself has contributed to the curious culture of Alphabet employees starting competing side businesses, with what it obliquely calls his own ""competitive venture."" That's almost certainly Page's flying car startup, Kitty Hawk, which presents an alternative vision for the future of urban transportation.A day after Uber's filing, Alphabet tried to claim the protections of the Apex Doctrine and keep Page out of view. But U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley sided with Uber on Friday, saying that Page has ""first-hand, non-repetitive knowledge."" She gave Uber up to four hours to talk to Page. So now it's pretty much official. Waymo versus Uber has turned into a legal showdown between two quasi-former industry chieftains: the combative, paranoid Kalanick, who no longer runs Uber but remains an influential figure on its board of directors and the soft-spoken, reclusive Page, the CEO of Alphabet, who has ceded much of the day-to-day control over Google to its chief executive, Sundar Pichai.With his deposition, Page will once again get to follow in the rich tradition of reluctant tech CEO witnesses, like Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos. It seems appropriate.

The views expressed in this commentary are solely his.

(CNN) Human history stretches back many, many millennia, but for much of the world (all of North America, for example), we lack any written history until very recent times. There are a few extraordinary exceptions.

Cuneiform tablets provide such a key resource, offering a direct written history of people and their activities in the ancient Near East beginning over 5,000 years ago, around 3000-500 B.C. Much of this precious record of humanity comes from archaeological sites in modern-day Iraq and Syria.

Protecting these historical resources has been a major international focus, especially since the second Gulf War. Cuneiform texts are the first items listed on the International Council of Museums' "" Red List "" -- which compiles the most endangered archaeological objects and works of art in the most vulnerable areas of the world to prevent them from being sold or illegally exported -- for both Iraq (issued 2003, updated 2015) and Syria (issued 2013).

The news that Hobby Lobby, in a deal that the Department of Justice described as ""fraught with red flags"" and against the advice of a cultural property law expert who warned the company that cuneiform tablets and other objects for sale are often looted, nonetheless bought over 5,000 artifacts in December 2010 is tragic.

According to the DOJ , a dealer in the United Arab Emirates shipped to Hobby Lobby items falsely labeled as ""ceramics"" and ""samples"" whose origin was falsely listed as Israel and Turkey. However, export of archaeological objects from Turkey would have been prohibited under long-standing Turkish laws . Israel unfortunately has, despite antiquities laws and criticism from the Israel Antiquities Authority , a well-known and active antiquities trade, although very recent efforts are trying at last to clamp down on it.

These objects have been ripped out of archaeological sites with no documentation and now forever lack context and key associations -- the kind of valuable information possible only with careful scientific excavation by archaeologists. This looting occurs because there is, sadly, a market for these objects -- even if this trade is illegal in many countries. We will now never know the full archaeological history of the 5,548 objects Hobby Lobby bought for $1.6 million

Hobby Lobby said in a statement that it wanted to collect objects and information relevant to the period before and around the time of the Bible. Instead, their actions have further contributed to the destruction of the increasingly rare and endangered archaeological record of this fascinating era.

It will not end with these particular objects. Their willful interest in collecting artifacts that are so often obtained through looting will only make things worse. This is the real travesty.

Hobby Lobby has acknowledged that ""regrettable mistakes"" were made in the transaction, but while they have to pay a $3 million fine and have agreed to return the artifacts as well, no compensation can fully reverse this disaster.

War and extremism have severely damaged cultural heritage in the Near East, most notably in the destruction of ancient monuments in places like Palmyra and Mosul . Hobby Lobby's actions are arguably harmful in a similar fashion, and all the more embarrassing as the company now acknowledges that it ""should have exercised more oversight and carefully questioned how the acquisitions were handled,"" Hobby Lobby's president, Steve Green, said in a statement.

He added : ""At no time did Hobby Lobby ever purchase items from dealers in Iraq or from anyone who indicated that they acquired items from that country.""

The vanishing material traces of the past are a vital educational resource for the world today. They reveal the rich and complex story of humanity -- showing a plural past of many peoples, ideas and faiths -- the very plurality that today's extremists typically seek to deny and to destroy in favor of a single, narrow, tyrannical vision.

We need to know much more about ancient objects, and especially those with contexts and associations, that can help undermine modern extremism and bigotry. The actions of Hobby Lobby have helped to rob us of part of this history and further threaten our valuable record of the human past."

""His statements about Syria really disturb me. No, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin does not have it right when it comes to Syria,"" Senator Lindsey Graham said. In separate television interviews, Graham and Senator John McCain, prominent Republican foreign policy voices, took aim at Tillerson's remarks last week that Russia may have ""got the right approach"" and the United States the wrong approach to Syria. Russia has backed President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's civil war, while the United States supports rebel groups trying to overthrow him. McCain told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that he ""sometimes"" regretted backing Tillerson's nomination by Republican President Donald Trump and that his comments on Russia being ""right"" on Syria made him emotional and upset. ""I know what the slaughter has been like. I know that the Russians knew that Bashar Assad was going to use chemical weapons. And to say that maybe we've got the wrong approach?"" he said. Both senators backed the nomination of Tillerson in January, even while expressing concern about his dealings with Russia when he was chief executive of ExxonMobil. (XOM.N) Graham, who visited Afghanistan and Pakistan last week with McCain, accused Tillerson of being ""AWOL"" on the two countries and failing to fill key State Department posts. ""I am so worried about the State Department, Graham said  on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" A State Department official responded to the criticism of Tillerson by saying that a U.S.-Russian-brokered ceasefire for southwest Syria was an example of what the secretary had described as the potential to coordinate with Russia, in spite of unresolved differences, ""to produce stability and serve our mutual security interests."" The official, who did not want to be identified, also said the State Department was taking an active role in a review of Afghanistan and Pakistan policy and continued to work with the White House on nominations. Since the exit of most foreign troops in 2014, Afghanistans U.S.-backed government has lost ground to a Taliban insurgency in a war that kills and maims thousands of civilians each year.

VOTE ON NORTH KOREA SANCTIONS WITHIN WEEKS: DIPLOMATS,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - United States Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley aims to put to a vote within weeks a U.N. Security Council resolution to impose stronger sanctions on North Korea over its long-range ballistic missile test, said several senior U.N. diplomats. Haley told some U.N. diplomats late last week of the ambitious timeline for a U.N. response to North Korea's launch on Tuesday of a missile that some experts believe could have the range to reach Alaska, and parts of the U.S. West Coast.  The U.S. mission to the United Nations declined to comment on the timeline for a council vote. Some Security Council diplomats have expressed doubt that a draft resolution could be put to a vote quickly. Following a nuclear weapons test by North Korea in September, while U.S. President Barack Obama was still in office, it took the U.N. Security Council three months to agree to strengthened sanctions. The United States gave China a draft resolution to impose stronger sanctions on Pyongyang after the 15-member Security Council met on Wednesday to discuss the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launch, diplomats said.  China's U.N. Ambassador Liu Jieyi told Reuters on Monday that it was important to ensure that any action the Security Council might take should be conducive to achieving the goal of a denuclearized, peaceful and stable Korean peninsula. ""We really must think very carefully about what is the best approach in the Security Council because a resolution, sanctions, are themselves not an objective,"" he said. When asked if the council could act within weeks, Liu said it would depend on how members ""see the way forward in terms of council action, in terms of how that is put into the wider context of ... improving the situation, preventing further tests, ensuring Security Council resolutions will be abided by."" Traditionally, the United States and China have negotiated new sanctions on North Korea before formally involving other council members. Diplomats said the United States would informally keep Britain and France in the loop, while China was likely talking to Russia. The United States, China, Russia, Britain and France are the Security Council's permanent veto-wielding powers. The United States could also face a battle to persuade Russia that council action against North Korea is needed. On Thursday, Russia objected to a council condemnation of North Korea's missile launch because the U.S.-drafted statement labeled it an ICBM, a designation Moscow disagrees with. Diplomats said that negotiations on the statement had stalled. North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs and the council has ratcheted up the measures in response to the country's five nuclear weapons tests and two long-range missile launches. During the Security Council meeting last Wednesday, Haley said some options to strengthen U.N. sanctions were to restrict the flow of oil to North Korea's military and weapons programs, increasing air and maritime restrictions and imposing targeted sanctions on senior officials. Diplomats said Washington proposed such options to Beijing two months ago, but that China had not engaged in discussions on the measures and instead only agreed to adding some people and entities to the existing U.N. sanctions list in June.

In Doha, a Western diplomat said creation of a ""terror finance monitoring mechanism"" would feature in the talks, but declined to elaborate. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, UAE and Egypt imposed sanctions last month, accusing Doha of aiding terrorism, something it denies. The State Department said Tillerson, who forged extensive ties in the Gulf as CEO of ExxonMobil, would hold talks with leaders in Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.  He was flying from Istanbul where he attended an international petroleum conference. R.C. Hammond, a senior adviser to Tillerson, said he would explore ways to end a stalemate following Qatar's rejection of 13 demands issued as condition for ending sanctions. ""The trips to Saudi Arabia and Qatar are about the art of the possible,"" said Hammond, who added that the 13 demands ""are done"" and ""are not worth revisiting as a package. Individually there are things in there that could work"". The demands included the closing of Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based pan-Arab television network, and a Turkish military base in Qatar. Saudi Arabia and its backers, which accuse Al Jazeera of being a platform for extremists and an agent of interference in their affairs, have threatened further sanctions against the emirate. Al Jazeera denies the allegations. Riyadh and its allies accuse Qatar of financing extremist groups and allying with Iran, the Gulf Arab states' regional rival. Qatar denies that it supports militant organizations, and many experts see the blockade as an attempt by Saudi Arabia to rein in Qatars increasingly independent foreign policy. The crisis has hit travel, food imports to Qatar, ratcheted up tensions in the Gulf and sown confusion among businesses, while pushing Qatar closer to Iran and Turkey which have offered support. The United States worries the crisis could affect its military and counter-terrorism operations and increase the regional influence of Tehran, which has been supporting Qatar by allowing it to use air and sea links through its territory. Qatar hosts Udeid Air Base, the largest U.S. military facility in the Middle East, from which U.S.-led coalition aircraft stage sorties against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed support for Saudi Arabia in the dispute. Hammond said it was critical that not only Qatar, but Riyadh and its allies take steps to halt any financial support flowing to extremists groups, especially following the defeat of Islamic State in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul. ""It's a two-way street,"" he said. ""There are no clean hands here."" ""We want progress on terrorism financing. The president strongly believes that if you cut off financing, you cut off the ability of terror to take hold in new areas,"" Hammond said. Moreover, he said, ""the longer that this struggle is in place, the more opportunity there is for Iran."" Editing by Jeremy Gaunt"
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-trade-usa-idUSKBN19U08U,UK-U.S. TRADE DEAL WILL NOT MAKE UP FOR LEAVING THE EU: MINISTER,"LONDON (Reuters) - A post-Brexit trade deal with the United States would not be enough to make up for leaving the European Union, British justice minister David Lidington said on Sunday, tempering Prime Minister Theresa May's enthusiasm about the U.S. offer.  May had warmly welcomed assurances on Saturday by U.S. President Donald Trump that a ""very powerful"" trade deal with Britain would be reached ""very, very quickly"" after Britain leaves the EU. Seeking to reassert her authority over a Brexit process thrown into chaos by a botched snap election last month, May described talks on trade with Trump and other world leaders at a G20 meeting as a ""powerful vote of confidence"" in Britain.  But one of her senior ministers dampened that enthusiasm on Sunday, in a sign of the difficult task May faces in uniting her own party behind a single exit strategy as key legislation is due to enter parliament next week. ""It wouldn't be enough on its own, no,"" Lidington told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. ""But it would be a very good thing to have - as would trade deals with the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America."" The government has touted the ability to strike bilateral trade deals, rather than EU-wide deal negotiated by Brussels, as one of the key benefits of leaving the bloc. Lidington campaigned strongly for Britain to remain in the EU before the 2016 referendum, but has since said he accepts the outcome of that vote. The Confederation of British Industry, a business lobby group, also warned against placing too much emphasis on a potential deal with the United States. ""Not every trade deal is necessarily a good and fair trade deal for both parties,"" CBI President Paul Drechsler told Sky television.   ""The USA has one of the best negotiating teams in the world in terms of trade deals. We don't want to walk into a bear hug - I would be wary of trying to be too fast on a trade deal."" May is expected to make a speech on Tuesday marking a year since she inherited power following Britain's surprise vote to leave the EU. The speech is seen as an attempt to move on from a tumultuous 12 months in which May set out a hardline approach to leaving the EU and called an election, but then failed to persuade the public to back her and lost her outright majority in parliament.  She has struck a deal with a small Northern Irish political party to support her minority government. Her weakened status has led to speculation that members of her Conservative Party - historically split between eurosceptics and more pro-European members - would be prepared to oust her if they did not get their way. Party unity will be tested by legislation which is due to be presented to parliament next week, outlining the government's plan to translate all EU law in British law as part of its preparation for leaving. A report in the Sunday Times newspaper cited anonymous sources as saying pro-European lawmakers could demand concessions in the bill.  A separate report sourced to an unnamed Conservative in the Mail on Sunday also said a 'Kamikaze' group of Brexit-supporting Conservatives would be prepared to oust her and force a new election if she did water down her Brexit plans. Dismissing those reports, Lidington said: ""Ive been in parliament 25 years and almost every July a combination of too much sun and too much warm prosecco leads to gossipy stories in the media.""

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-stada-arzneimitt-m-a-takeover-idUSKBN19V0LN,GERMANY'S STADA BACKS REVISED TAKEOVER BID FROM BAIN AND CINVEN,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Stada (STAGn.DE) backed a revised takeover bid on Monday from buyout groups Bain Capital and Cinven, which have secured backing from investors controlling around 20 percent of the German generic drugmaker's shares. Stada said the buyout firms had sweetened their takeover offer by 25 cents per share to 66.25 euros after their previous 5.3 billion-euro ($6 billion) bid fell through. The revised offer is approximately 16 million euros above the prior offer. The private equity groups will also lower their acceptance threshold to 63 percent, Stada said, after the last offer failed to win the backing of the 67.5 percent they had targeted. The new offer is the latest twist for the takeover of one of the last remaining independent generic drugmakers in Europe. Shares in Stada, which has seen management upheaval and previous failed offers, were up 1.2 percent at 65.27 euros by 1253 GMT, outperforming the German mid-cap index .MDAXI.   Stada's chief executive and its head of finance resigned last week after the failure of the earlier bid. Stada said Germany's Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) had approved the renewed offer, waiving Bain and Cinven from a one-year ban from resubmitting a revised offer. Carl Ferdinand Oetker, Chairman of Stada's Supervisory Board said it backed the new offer as ""a stable basis for developing Stada in the best interest of the company for the future"".    Some shareholders including U.S. hedge fund Elliott have bought stakes, speculating on securing a higher price for any remaining stock. The last takeover offer only won the backing of 65.52 percent of shareholders. Many buyout firms have been flush with cash after recent rounds of divestments and amid cheap borrowing costs. Sources have said that Bain and Cinven would look into buying more healthcare businesses to combine with Stada over the medium term, seeking cost cuts that would make the high investment in Stada worthwhile.

Hes denied wrongdoing. Shkreli operated the hedge fund and Retrophin from the same office in midtown Manhattan.Su, 42, said he saw a $900,000 investment the hedge fund -- MSMB Capital -- made in Retrophin suddenly get reclassified as a loan. Shkreli would also drop backdated transactions -- sometimes months later -- on Sus desk for approval, according to the testimony.Su said he went to the SEC in May 2012.There was no transparency in the amount of assets that MSMB had, he told jurors. That was a red flag for me.Su said he walked by the office of Retrophins president on his last day there.I said Im not going back to work. All these things dont add up, he told the jury. I was done.Earlier, investor Darren Blanton also testified that he complained to the SEC about Shkreli because it took him three years to get his money back.Its not clear which complaint prompted the SEC to start an investigation, but regulators began a probe of Shkreli in 2012, according to prosecutors, and Shkreli testified before the SEC in August 2013 and February 2014. Shkreli was ousted as the head of Retrophin around September 2014 and in December he was arrested and charged.Caroline Stewart, who worked for Shkreli for about eight months in 2011 analyzing stocks at the hedge fund, testified that she had threatened to expose her ex-boss to investors because he was lying and exaggerating to clients. She said she sat next to him and overheard his phone conversations.Im so sick of him saying all of his canned s--t all the time, she wrote to Kevin Mulleady, the chief executive officer at the hedge fund.Nobody knows the FDA better than we do, she quoted Shkreli as telling people on the phone. Nobody is smarter or better funded than we are.What utter crap, she wrote in the message. Its his M.O. Hes done it several times. Hes mentally unstable.The hedge fund imploded in February 2011 when Shkreli lost $7 million on a trade, leaving only a little more than $2 million in assets, Stewart told jurors earlier. Prosecutors say it was at that point Shkreli took whatever money was left from his investors and put it in Retrophin.Shkreli Partly Gagged During TrialStewart said she felt affection for Shkreli and was the only employee to come to work after that. Stewart also wrote Shkreli an email in an attempt to cheer him up.I know things must seem bleak to you but try not to be too disheartened, she wrote. I think the mistake was one anybody could have made. Youre the smartest most ambitious/driven and also kindest person I have ever met.Those feelings soon dissipated and Stewart said her regard turned to anger when Shkreli stopped paying her on a regular basis. When he did pay her, it was only two-thirds of her $150,000 salary, she said.Im done trusting Martin, Stewart wrote in an instant message. I cant believe a word that comes out of his mouth.The case is U.S. v. Shkreli, 15-cr-0637, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn)."
http://cnn.com/2017/07/09/world/amelia-earhart-aviation-mysteries/index.html,AMELIA EARHART AND OTHER MILE-HIGH MYSTERIES,"(CNN) Eighty years after Amelia Earhart disappeared over the Pacific, a newly discovered photo aims to finally put the mystery of what happened to the famed pilot to rest.

A History channel documentary quotes experts who say the blurry image shows Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan alive after their plane crashed in the Pacific Ocean. The pair disappeared on July 2, 1937, while attempting to fly to Howland Island.

Earhart, who had already become the first female pilot to fly solo across the Atlantic, was vying for the title of first woman to pilot around the world.

Since her disappearance, Earhart has been a figure of fascination, with professional and amateur investigators offering many theories on what happened to the daring pilot.

The photograph, recently discovered in the National Archives by former US Treasury Agent Les Kinney, allegedly shows Earhart and Noonan among a group of people on a dock on Jaluit Atoll in the Marshall Islands.

Some experts believe the figure on the far left is Fred Noonan and the person sitting, facing away from the camera, is Amelia Earhart.

Publication of the image comes in advance of the network's two-hour special, ""Amelia Earhart: The Lost Evidence,"" which airs Sunday.

The photo could support the documentary's theory that Earhart and Noonan crashed in the Marshall Islands and were captured by the Japanese military. This means the duo could have died in Japanese custody on the island of Saipan rather than in a crash landing, according to the History channel.

Of course, Earhart's disappearance isn't the first time a plane has vanished without a trace.

Here are six other cases of plane disappearances and disasters, some of which remain unsolved.

Malaysia Airlines Flight 370

JUST WATCHED The search for MH370 Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The search for MH370 01:11

The Boeing 777 passenger jet vanished on March 8, 2014, about an hour into its flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing . There were 239 people aboard.

There was no distress call before it lost contact, changed course and began to spiral downwards over open water.

International search teams combed the Indian Ocean for months, but have found no clues. Three pieces of the aircraft found later do not explain what caused it to crash.

Aviation experts and government officials remain baffled over the mystery of the jet and the fate of its passengers.

Air France Flight 447

JUST WATCHED What caused Air France 447 crash Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What caused Air France 447 crash 02:55

The Airbus A330 passenger jet disappeared on May 31, 2009, as it crossed the Atlantic Ocean en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris.

The plane's last communication with control center put its location two to four days by ship from the nearest ports, complicating search efforts.

It took almost two years before the bulk of the wreckage, the majority of bodies, and the voice and data recorders were recovered.

French authorities said ice crystals disrupted the system used to determine the plane's airspeed, causing the autopilot to disconnect. The plane plunged into the ocean.

Company-owned Boeing 727

JUST WATCHED 2014: Joe Padilla, missing since flight disappeared in 2003 Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 2014: Joe Padilla, missing since flight disappeared in 2003 04:18

A company-owned Boeing 727 vanished while flying from the Angolan capital of Luanda to Burkina Faso on May 25, 2003.

The plane, which reportedly sat unused for months before its unexpected departure, took off with its lights off and a dysfunctional transponder, according to Air & Space . Witnesses said the plane taxied erratically and did not communicate with the flight tower before takeoff.

There are conflicting reports on the number of people in the jet, but flight engineer Ben Charles Padilla is believed to be one of them . Some reports say he was alone, while others say three people were aboard.

The plane has not been heard from since. Its whereabouts are unknown to this day.

EgyptAir Flight 990

A National Transportation Safety Board Official stands with piles of wreckage from EgyptAir Flight 990 on November 1, 2000.

The Boeing 767 passenger jet crashed on October 31, 1999, en route from New York City to Cairo, killing all 217 people on board.

The plane made a rapid plunge of almost 14,000 feet in 36 seconds about 60 miles off the coast of Nantucket. It disappeared from radar about 90 seconds later without ever issuing a distress call.

Though its debris was later found in the Atlantic Ocean, speculation remains on what caused the crash.

Theories include a possible suicide by the pilot or co-pilot, complete with tales of a chaotic struggle for controls in the cockpit. Egyptian authorities have said a mechanical failure was to blame.

BSAA 'Stardust'

A Lancastrian aircraft on display at a trade show at Handley Page Airfield in Radlett, England, on July 12, 1946.

A British South American Airways (BSAA) Avro Lancastrian, nicknamed ""Stardust,"" disappeared after taking off from Buenos Aires to Santiago on August 2, 1947. There were 11 people on board.

Minutes before touchdown, the aircraft issued a strange Morse code transmission: STENDEC. Then it vanished.

Searches for the missing plane turned up nothing for more than 50 years, sparking countless conspiracy theories, including alien abductions. However, the conspiracy theories ended in 2000, when the plane's wreckage was discovered buried in a glacier in the Argentine Andes.

All 11 people on board were killed in the crash. The message ""STENDEC"" remains a mystery.

Flight 19 Navy Bombers

Members of the Navy pose in front of one of the Flight 19 planes that disappeared in 1945.

Flight 19 refers to five Navy bombers that disappeared off the Florida coast on December 5. 1945.

A flight instructor flew one plane, and qualified pilots were in the others, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command

Radio transmissions indicated that the instructor got lost when compasses malfunctioned over the Bermuda Triangle. Radio contact was lost before the exact problem was determined, and no traces of the planes were ever found.

Adding to the mystery, a search aircraft sent to look for Flight 19 also disappeared. The patrol plane, which took off later that day, has not been seen or heard from since."

http://cnn.com/2017/07/07/asia/bengaluru-alcohol-ban/index.html,INDIA'S SILICON VALLEY GRAPPLES WITH ALCOHOL BAN,"Bengaluru, India (CNN) This Friday, office workers in Bengaluru -- the Silicon Valley of India -- will be unable to enjoy a customary after work drink, following a court ruling outlawing the sale of alcohol in the majority of the city's bars and restaurants.

In the last seven days over 700 pubs, hotels, restaurants and wine stores in the heart of the city have gone dry, with many being forced to shut shop altogether.

The nationwide ruling, which officially came into effect on Saturday July 1, is the result of a Supreme Court order banning the sale of alcohol within 500 meters (0.3 miles) of national highways.

Whereas most Indian cities have been unaffected by the ruling, downtown Bengaluru is relatively unique in that it is crisscrossed by six major roads classified as national highways.

The city's most prominent and well known highway -- Mahatma Gandhi Road -- passes through the central business district, a nightlife hotspot boasting an estimated 140 bars , while Old Madras Road, is also dotted with bars and restaurants.

Drinkers are served coffee in a beer mug at Pecos, one of Bengaluru's oldest pubs.

Tech hub

Beginning in the 1980s, a boom in IT-related industries helped transform the capital of the Indian state of Karnataka into a globalized tech hub. Today Bengaluru is home to some of the world's best known IT and software companies, helping it to garner a reputation as one of India's most cosmopolitan and forward-facing cities.

Many of the bars affected by the new alcohol ban maintain close ties to the city's tech sector, acting as informal meeting places for its legions of white collar workers.

At the famed Pecos bar, a 29-year-old Bengaluru institution located in the heart of the downtown area, the ban's sweeping affects were already being felt. ""We only sell draught beer. It is getting difficult to wait any further. The sales have collapsed,"" said Pecos' general manager Srinivas Gowda.

Pecos, which operates several locations throughout the city, became India's first pub chain to list on the country's stock exchange in 2015. Now, a banner outside the entrance of the original location identifies the bar as a ""Highway Coffee Pub.""

The ruling will force many bars and restaurants to shut, said M Rajendra, president of the state-wide Hotel and Restaurants Association. ""It is a huge investment we have made on buildings. That type of investment -- land, property, maintenance... How can we relocate? If liquor is not sold there, who would want to go there?"" he asked.

Karnataka state's Excise Commissioner, Manjunath Naik, estimated the state generates up to $300 million in revenue from the sale of alcohol every year.

A movement is now underway to reclassify stretches of highway that pass through cities as roads after the proposal was approved by the Supreme Court.

How long this will take remains unknown. Any change in highway classification would require approval from the transport ministry.

Mrirani Biswas, 29, a senior content writer for an Indian ride sharing app, said that it's a matter of when, and not if, the ban is repealed.

""I don't think the liquor ban will stay for too long, for the simple reason that there are too many pubs. They cannot totally shut down everything all together. It's impossible."""

But feather-light lagers aren't the only game in town anymore.

The country's craft beer scene is booming, having welcomed more than a dozen micro-breweries in the past two years.

""The beer culture in Vietnam starts with Bia Hoi,"" Hao Tran, managing editor of lifestyle website Vietcetera , tells CNN. The craft beer scene that has evolved has done so from people drinking beer in the Old Quarter in Hanoi or Bui Vien Street in Saigon, he says.

""But there's so much more to beer culture in Vietnam now than just that particular image.""

Tapping new tastes

Pasteur Street Brewing Company draws a crowd.

Vietnam is one of the biggest beer consumers in Asia drinking 3.8 billion liters a year in 2016, according to Ministry of Industry and Trade.

The brands have, for example, introduced potent Indian pale ales (IPAs) and sour gose -- a tart and salty style of German beer -- to the market.

""As Vietnam has continued to experience income growth and taste for global concepts and standards, that's where craft beer has really come in,"" says Tran.

""The tastes and preferences of Vietnamese consumers are changing and evolving.""

What's brewing

One of Vietnam's craft pioneers, Pasteur Street Brewing Co opened its doors in 2015 and now distributes not only all over Vietnam, but also to Malaysia, Australia, Hong Kong, and the United States -- with Japan and Europe to come later this year.

For the past two years, Pasteur Street has been leading the revolt against boring lagers and predictable pale ales -- an effort that was rewarded with three gold medals at the 2016 Asian Beer Medal competition.

also behind Helmed by Americans John Reid and Alex Violette -- the latter isalso behind Upslope Brewing Company , in Colorado -- the brewery imports its hops from the US and malts from Europe, but adds a local touch to every recipe.

Hide Caption 7 of 9 Photos: Vietnam's new brews In addition to a bar, restaurant and rooftop terrace, the two-story East West Brewing Company building also houses a brewery, where visitors can learn about the craft brewing process. Hide Caption 8 of 9 Photos: Vietnam's new brews ""It's all about really educating our (Vietnamese) consumers,"" Loc Truong, founder of East West Brewing Company , tells CNN. ""You cannot show them what craft beer is if you don't have a craft brewery to really guide them through."" Hide Caption 9 of 9

""It's not just a marketing ploy ... using local ingredients is what the industry is all about,"" says Reid. ""It's about innovation and changing things up.""

The brewers reach for everything from locally made Marou chocolate to Dalat coffee, passion fruit and even divisive durian -- a spiky Asian fruit with a distinct smell.

They've created 70 varieties, including Jasmine IPA, Passion Fruit Wheat, Lemongrass and Phu Quoc Pepper Saison and Cyclo Imperial Chocolate Stout, which won gold at last year's World Beer Cup.

""The Vietnamese are becoming so open-minded,"" Reid tells CNN.

""With the internet and access to information about what's going on on a world stage, they want to be part of that. You see craft beer happening in America, maybe some Vietnamese go visit family in California ... and they say: 'How come we don't have this in our country?'""

A welcome change

While many of the first microbreweries were set up by foreigners, Vietnamese entrepreneurs have also joined the mix.

Newly opened East West Brewing Company , for example, is run by Loc Truong, a Vietnamese-American who worked at Anheuser-Busch InBev -- the company behind brands such as Stella Artois and Corona -- before striking out with his founding partners.

""My being Vietnamese helps the craft beer industry, for sure, because that's one step to connect with the market,"" says Truong, who was born in Vietnam but studied in the US. ""Why do people buy craft beer? It's higher quality, but who's behind it also adds value.""

Truong's lightly hopped beers, such as the East West Pale Ale, he says, provide a stepping stone to stronger flavors for new craft converts.

From there, it gets more challenging, with a bolder Far East IPA, Coffee Vanilla Porter, or 12% ABV Independence Stout.

That's alongside Asia-inspired varieties, such as Le Wit, a wit-style beer made with Asian pear, and a dainty Saigon Rose that's infused with raspberries.

""A lot of people don't know that there are so many different types of flavors in beer,"" says Truong.

""We'll see customers coming back five or six times a week, saying they can't drink the traditional lagers or (Bia Hoi beer) anymore. Once they tried craft, they never went back.""

Building a bridge

East West Brewing Company's set up.

In the land of 30-cent drafts of Bia Hoi, charging consumers $5 for craft draft remains a challenge.

An on-site brewery was a crucial part of the persuasion strategy for East West Brewing Company, which opened in January.

""It's all about really educating our (Vietnamese) consumers,"" Loc Truong, founder of East West Brewing Company , tells CNN.

""You cannot show them what craft beer is if you don't have a craft brewery to really guide them through.""

It helps that breweries and bars serving craft beers tend to be clustered in Ho Chi Minh City around central areas of Districts 1 and 2, where there's lots of foot traffic.

As a result, new beer-oriented tours have added to the buzz, such as the bar and brewery motorbike excursion operated by Vespa Adventures

Truong and his team are based in the heart of District 1.

Inside the massive glass building, guests can mingle at the industrial-chic bar and restaurant downstairs, soak up the sun on the rooftop, or take a tour of the steel fermenting tanks and barrel-aging room.

Before opening, Truong expected expats and travelers to drive sales, but he was pleasantly surprised that 85% of his patrons were Vietnamese in the first six months of business.

Truong says that is partly due to a growing middle class in Vietnam.

With a 6% annual increase in GDP per capita, the Boston Consulting Group predicts Vietnam's middle class will account for 23% of the population of 95 million by 2020, up from 16% in 2015.

""Vietnam moves very, very fast,"" says Truong. ""One thing catches on and the next thing you know, the whole market is shifting."""
http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/insider-guide-london/index.html,TRAVELING TO LONDON? INSIDERS SHARE TIPS - CNN.COM,"Chris Newlands, for CNN Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Updated 11th July 2017

Editor's Note Ã¢ÂÂ CNN Insider Guides are thoroughly checked for accuracy. Given the fluid nature of the travel industry, however, some listings may fall out of date before guides can be updated. The best practice is to confirm current information on official websites before making plans to visit any business or attraction.

(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Buckingham Palace, the Dickens Museum, Hyde Park, a Hitchcock walking tour, Kew Gardens, Shakespeare's Globe Theater, St. Paul's cathedral, the Thames, Wimbledon -- these are just a few examples of the best of London

It should be no surprise that a city 2,000 years old is an alphabetic mishmash of things to gawp at. But like a Dickensian novel, the best of London's real character seeps out of the cracks that split its major attractions.

Yes, London is the world's financial capital (along with New York), yes it's Europe's cultural hub and, yes, more than 300 languages are spoken within its perimeter. But we don't care about any of that, mate.

Transport links have been improved, hotels have had facelifts and restaurants have been refitted. London looks better as a result and now -- before the dust and grime settle down again -- is a great time to visit the city:

Hotels

Luxury

The Savoy

Hotels this quaint go for ÃÂ£351 per night.

It came a year late and ÃÂ£100 million over budget, but in October 2010 one of the world's most legendary hotels opened its doors after a rumored ÃÂ£200 million facelift. Unlike some facelifts, however, the results for this old lady --- now owned by an Arab sheikh and run by Canadians --- are impressive.

Perfectly located for the shops of Covent Garden and the cinemas of Leicester Square, it was Marilyn Monroe's London hotel of choice and, if you can stretch to the ÃÂ£400-plus nightly fee, it can to become yours. The acclaimed Savoy Grill -- now in the hands of acerbic celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay (do not expect the steaks to be as blue as his language) -- can be expensive, but is not overpriced.

Tip: Rooms 328, 428, 528, 628 enjoy river views but entry-level prices.

Charlotte Street Hotel

Situated in London's media neighborhood just north of Soho, this former dental hospital now contains 52 individually designed rooms, including loft and penthouse suites. The huge, comfortable beds and trademark polished granite and oak bathrooms are suitably indulgent, and some rooms have luxuriously high ceilings.

Tip: if you can afford it, go for one of the split-level loft suites. Among other things they feature TVs in the bathroom.

Mid-range

The Arosfa

This reasonably priced townhouse hotel was once the Bloomsbury home of artist John Everett Millais. It's close to Euston Station, the British Museum and the shops of Oxford Street. Wi-Fi is available and breakfast is included.

Tip: Arosfa has only 15 rooms, so book early.

The Rookery

Located in a quiet area a short distance from the Barbican, St. Paul's, Holborn and the City, the Rookery is characterized by open fires, Georgian detailing, wonky floors and bulging bookshelves. There's an honesty bar downstairs, a tiny garden terrace for the summer, 33 double rooms and two singles.

All are as quirky as the building. Bedrooms are named after people who lived in the Dickensian buildings at some point over the past 250 years --- including a disgraced preacher and a prostitute hanged for murder.

Tip: There's no restaurant, the perfect reason to head down the road to the acclaimed St. John for some meaty, masculine English fare.

Budget

The Hoxton

A pound for a room? Take a dozen and still have change for a show.

A pound for a room? Take a dozen and still have change for a show.

This smart budget option could not be better located, bang in the middle of the capital's most buzzing nightlife area. The Hoxton has been a big hit since it opened in 2006, not least for its famed ÃÂ£1 rooms, which it sells throughout the year. A word of warning: during the last sale, 500 rooms were booked in less than 10 minutes.

There are no mini-bars, suites, or turndown service, but you do get complimentary Wi-Fi, a banana, yogurt and orange juice for breakfast and one hour of free calls each day to anywhere except ""Costa Fortune,"" according to the management.

Tip: When Pret A Manger sandwich shop entrepreneur Sinclair Beecham opened this 205-room hotel, he used the noÃ¢ÂÂfrills airline approach to setting room rates -- the earlier you book, the less you pay.

Dining

The Wolseley

Just along from the Ritz Hotel, the Wolseley exudes history and style. Housed in a former car showroom, and later a branch of Barclays bank, it has vaulted ceilings, polished marble, an art deco interior and the odd celebrity.

Poached native lobster, Cornish crab, two types of caviar and three kinds of oyster decorate the menu. Harden's has tipped The Wolseley as an excellent business restaurant, but the look and feel is anything but stuffy, so leave the laptop in the office. Traditional English breakfast here is a must and, with a reported 1,000 covers each day, so is booking ahead.

Wild Honey

Head to the exclusive Mayfair area of London for dinner and you might expect to need a government bailout to settle your bill. Not so at Wild Honey.

Value is the theme in the wood-paneled dining room with favorites including crisp ox tongue and slow-cooked venison.The Saturday lunch menu will set you back ÃÂ£29, as does the a la carte. The cheeseboard is excellent.

Aurora

Great location, excellent service. Aurora on Lexington Street is small, intimate and has excellent service.

The walls are painted a bohemian blood red with the interior dark, cozy and unpretentious. The modern European menu is as equally unfussy and changes each month.

There are two sittings, one at 7:15 p.m. and the other at 9:15 p.m. --- opt for the latter and you can finish off at one of the many late-night bars of Soho, London's boozy and sometimes seedy entertainment quarter. Tables on the ground floor enjoy a better ambiance than those downstairs.

Busaba Eathai

Some serious (London) Thai.

Some serious (London) Thai. Nestled within the underbelly of Soho, this is communal Thai dining in stylish, understated surroundings.

The no-booking policy means you can expect queues on Friday and Saturday nights, providing the perfect opportunity for people-watching (and Sohoites deserve some watching). For two people or solo diners, the wait should be no more than 15 minutes.

There are no starters or desserts, just mains and sides, but they're excellent. The tom yam talay, green papaya salad and morning glory are particularly hard to decline. Service, unfortunately, can be hit-and-miss.

Leon

Right behind the Tate Modern museum, this is one more than two dozen Leon eateries in London and arguably the best. It's the ultimate credit-crunch restaurant, comprising healthy eating, ethically sourced fast-food and rock-bottom prices.

Dishes are fresh, simple and seasonal. They include a range of wraps, superfood salads, soups and hot meals --- the Moroccan meatballs and the chili chicken are great. Lunchtimes can be busy with office workers from the Blue Fin building rubbing shoulders with journalists from the nearby Financial Times.

Nightlife

Experimental Cocktail Club

The only way to ensure entry to this Chinatown speakeasy is to e-mail before 5 p.m. (reservation@chinatownecc.com); phone bookings are not an option. Cocktails here aren't that experimental, but they're excellent and come in at around ÃÂ£10. The Havana is a house favorite.

You'll find mirrored ceilings, ancient Parisian architecture, tiny couches, total intimacy and a ÃÂ£5 cover charge after 11 p.m. Check out the loos, which sport flamingo wallpaper.

The entry consists of a scruffy door, absolutely no signage and doormen with firmly held views on just about everything. Good luck.

Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese

No best of London experience is complete without a beer at one of its many historic pubs, and they don't come much older or more historic than Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese.

Frequented by Mark Twain, Voltaire, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Oscar Wilde, the pub has been on this site since it was rebuilt in 1667 after the Great Fire of London. Charles Dickens, known to have been a regular of this higgledy-piggledy temple to serious drinking, referred to it in ""A Tale of Two Cities.""

Expect to have to stoop, dive down cramped staircases and contend with sawdust-strewn floors as you move from room to room. The real draw? A pint of Sam Smith's for a fraction of the price of beer in other London pubs.

Booking Office

Perfect spot for a pre-railride cocktail.

Cunningly named, the Booking Office sits on the site of the old booking hall of St. Pancras station and is found in the lobby of the refurbished St. Pancras Renaissance Hotel.

It's a great place to enjoy a cocktail while admiring what is undoubtedly one of the architectural wonders of the capital -- a magnificent red-brick Gothic masterpiece that was formerly the Midland Grand Hotel.

The Midland Grand closed almost 80 years ago and only narrowly avoided demolition. It was reopened in 2011 after a seemingly never-ending ÃÂ£150-million refit. The cocktail menu lives up to the surroundings and shows a deep respect for the history (and abundance) of British drinking with sours, fizzes and cobblers.

Ronnie Scott's

It's dark, it's dingy and the waiters shush you if you talk over the numbers. We like.

Ella, Miles and Curtis are just some of the greats to have graced Ronnie's down the years. This seminal jazz club tucked away on Soho's Frith Street is worth a visit even if you don't like jazz. It's jazz hands all-round if you do.

Tables are arranged in neat, tiered rows around a sunken stage, with luminous red lamps dotted around the dim room. Seats are priced according to the view and act. Cocktails are very much a club asset. Unfortunately they've stopped serving The Ellington, apparently a favorite of the Duke himself, but the choice is plentiful. Forget eating here -- it's not the main draw and largely a disappointment.

Shopping

Selfridges

Hailed as the world's best department store by many industry insiders, Selfridges dominates the west end of Oxford Street and is made up of six floors, four hectares of shopping space and two exhibition halls.

Although second to Harrods in terms of size and celebrity, it's less touristy, more cutting-edge and attracts a more discerning clientele. It's high-end, high-octane and comes highly recommended.

You can stay the whole day, leave empty-handed and still feel like Julia Roberts in that scene from ""Pretty Woman."" In any case, it contains 10 restaurants to keep your energy levels up while its personal shoppers can do the hard work for you.

Borough Market

London's oldest market --- dating to the 13th century --- is also its busiest. On the banks of the Thames just south of London Bridge, you'll find beautifully displayed organic fruit and veg, cheese, cakes, bread, olive oil, fish, meat, beer, wine and chocolate. Go hungry, go early, sample everything and bring cash -- few stallholders accept credit cards.

Columbia Road Flower Market

Not recommended for hay feverites.

With thousands of flowers crammed into one noisy Victorian terraced street, London's Columbia Road Flower Market -- now lined with fancy boutiques -- is a throwback to the old East End. From 8 a.m.-2 p.m. every Sunday, the flowers and plants up for sale are some of the best (and cheapest) around. Arrive early to avoid the crowds. Blooming marvelous.

Attractions

Views from Waterloo Bridge

Londoners bore visitors to death about how great the views are from Waterloo Bridge, but they have a point. Although it contends for the title of ugliest bridge in London, the views are inspiring, and you can save yourself the money it costs to ride the London Eye (and the one-hour wait) and head here.

On one hand are the Royal Festival Hall, Elizabeth Tower (as Big Ben has been renamed to commemorate the queen's Diamond Jubilee), the Houses of Parliament and the BT Tower.

Looking in the other direction you can take in the views of St. Paul's, Canary Wharf, the Gherkin (as the rather phallic skyscraper properly called 30 St. Mary Axe is dubbed), the Oxo Tower and the recently completed Shard, which cost ÃÂ£450 million to build and at 310 meters is the tallest building in the European Union. The views after dark are especially good.

St. Paul's Cathedral

Christopher Wren's masterpiece has squatted imposingly in the City of London for the past 300 years. It famously withstood the Blitz and has become something of a monument to the resilience of London.

Down in the crypt, you can check out the tombs of some of the nation's greatest heroes including Admiral Lord Nelson and the Duke of Wellington. You can also try out the acoustic quirks of the Whispering Gallery and continue the climb to the Golden Gallery for views across London. Tickets cost ÃÂ£18 from Monday to Saturday. The cathedral reverts to its traditional role on Sunday, when it's open to worshippers for free.

48-hour itinerary

Taking on London in one weekend is like eating soup with chopsticks. You haven't got a chance. But if you insist on trying to devour the monster in one short sitting, here's a suggested hit list.

1. Arty start

After an early breakfast at one of the many stalls of Borough Market (see review), take the short walk beside the river to the Tate Modern.

Tate Modern

Damien Hirst's art -- tanked up in the Tate.

London's most visited (it's free) and innovative gallery, Tate Modern is housed in a former power station with the space itself as much of an attraction as the collections. The interior is a glorious, unpretentious playground of modern art, as appealing to children and amateurs as it is to adults and art experts.

Permanent collections include works by Matisse, Rothko and Andy Warhol, as well as the best of contemporary British art.

If you get bored, you can wander along the South Bank to find the Royal Festival Hall, Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, The Hayward art gallery, The Royal National Theatre and the London Film Museum. Plus a gaggle of performance artists who could be break dancing or impersonating Charlie Chaplin.

2. Showstopper

Soho is perfect for an early dinner -- Aurora and Busaba Eathai are strong contenders (see reviews) --- and one of many shows in Theatreland.

Theatreland

Theatreland is the largest theater district in the world. It's bordered by The Strand to the south, Oxford Street to the north, Regent Street to the west and Kingsway to the east with its heart being Shaftesbury Avenue, home to six theaters.

No trip to London is complete without catching a show, but show business can be an expensive business, so head to the half-price (for performances that day) ticket booth in Leicester Square. It opens at 9 a.m. but queues form much earlier.

3. Tower trail

So that's what nearly 3,000 diamonds look like.

Day two begins with breakfast at the Wolseley (see review) and a trip east to the Tower of London. So that's what nearly 3,000 diamonds look like.

For a thousand years the Tower of London, a UNESCO World Heritage site, has protected, threatened, imprisoned and occasionally executed the people of London. Luckily, these days it serves only to entertain and educate them.

The biggest draw is the crown jewels. The Imperial State Crown alone is made up of 2,868 diamonds, 273 pearls, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds and five rubies -- basically very bling. The medieval palace, Traitors' Gate, the Yeomen Warders (""Beefeaters"") and the ravens add to the atmosphere.

4. Park up

Weather dependent (yes, it sometimes rains in London) the rest of the day could be best spent in Hyde Park --- one of the capital's lungs. But if the weather beats you, nearby Exhibition Road can offer cover in the form of the Science Museum, The Natural History Museum or the Victoria and Albert Museum. Entrance is free, although charges are sometimes levied for special exhibitions and events.

Hyde Park

Hyde Park is one of the greatest city parks in the world.

It has been open to the public since 1637, covers 142 hectares and contains more than 4,000 trees, a large lake, a meadow, ornamental flower gardens and two restaurants. Monuments include The Serpentine Bridge, the Joy of Life fountain, the Achilles statue and the Diana Memorial Fountain.

Swimming races are staged in the Serpentine on Saturday morning and Christmas Day. Open from 5 a.m. to midnight all year round.

5. Bike with Boris

Hardy visitors can join the dots of a London visit on a ""Boris bike."" Set up in July 2010, the public bicycle sharing scheme is modeled on Montreal's.

The bikes, referred to as ""Boris bikes"" because rumbustious, larger-than-life mayor Boris Johnson launched the scheme, can be picked up at any one of 315 docking stations dotted around central London. They're designed for short trips and, so while the first 30 minutes are free, a two-and-a-half-hour trip will cost ÃÂ£10."
http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/31/technology/tujia-airbnb-china-melissa-yang/index.html,CHINA'S TUJIA IS TAKING ITS RIVALRY WITH AIRBNB OVERSEAS,"Tujia is taking its rivalry with Airbnb global.

China's leading home-rental site has been a thorn in Airbnb's side in the world's most populous country. It's often referred to as a clone of the U.S. startup, but Tujia co-founder Melissa Yang takes issue with that.

""We are not copying anyone's business model,"" she said in an interview.

Tujia first started out renting out vacation properties that were essentially mini-hotels, fully run by Tujia staff.

The home-rental side of the company -- which, like Airbnb, connects property owners with travelers looking for alternatives to hotels -- came later. But to address Chinese hosts and travelers' general wariness, Tujia offers a broader range of services than Airbnb, like inspecting and cleaning properties.

Related: Airbnb makes a late play for China

Now, Tujia is chasing the rapidly growing number of Chinese people traveling abroad to popular destinations in Southeast Asia, Japan and South Korea. The company is currently seeking a fresh round of funds, in part to help expand products and properties abroad.

Tujia set up a small team in Japan in 2016, and Yang says bookings have now quadrupled there in just one year.

""We know China travelers the best,"" Yang said. ""We follow whatever Chinese travelers want.""

That includes following them to countries where Airbnb has already claimed a stake.

Airbnb has been targeting overseas Chinese travelers for years. It says one of the reasons it's expanding in Japan at the moment is to gain more traction and name recognition among Chinese visitors to the country.

Airbnb is also stepping up its efforts in China, a market it had neglected for years. It has just 80,000 listings in China, compared with Tujia's 430,000.

Related: Airbnb raises $1 billion in funding

Yang says she welcomes the competition on Tujia's home turf.

""Tujia doesn't want to be the only company to educate the market,"" she said. ""We welcome players to join us.""

While Tujia has the bigger scale in China, Yang acknowledges that Airbnb is in a strong position to attract overseas Chinese travelers.

The U.S. startup has 3 million listings worldwide, compared with Tujia's 20,000 outside of China.

Yang has a strong sense of wanderlust herself. She lived in the U.S. for more than a decade and has traveled all over the world.

After graduating from Tsinghua University -- known as China's MIT -- with a degree in automation, she studied computer science in the U.S.

While living in Seattle in 2006, Yang founded Escapia, a startup that provided vacation rental software. It caught the eye of Airbnb rival HomeAway, which bought it for about $10 million in 2010, according to SEC filings.

Related: Watch out Uber, Didi just launched an English app

Yang then moved back to Beijing to work with Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30), but soon felt the pull of entrepreneurship again.

She co-founded Tujia in 2011. The company became a unicorn -- a startup worth $1 billion or more -- in 2015.

Yang regularly travels to Silicon Valley, a place that reminds her, in some ways, of Beijing. Both destinations are full of young people with big dreams, hungry to start their own business and learn new technology, she said.

In her opinion, Silicon Valley and Beijing ""are the most exciting places for entrepreneurs in the world.""

President Trump has recently taken steps to overhaul the H-1B visa system that many Silicon Valley companies use to bring in foreign tech talent, a development Yang called disappointing.

Countries should be openly competing for the best tech talent, she said.

Related: Indian tech boss: Trump's H-1B visa curbs 'will hurt'

Yang recently stepped back from Tujia's day-to-day operations, and is searching for promising startups in China as an entrepreneur in residence with investment firm IDG Capital.

Like many in the tech industry, she believes artificial intelligence will fundamentally change the world.

To the big AI question -- Are we all going to be replaced by robots? -- she has a blunt answer:

""Sooner or later, yeah.""

http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/10/investing/wells-fargo-fake-account-settlement/index.html,WELLS FARGO VICTIMS GET CLOSER TO PAYBACK IN $142 MILLION SETTLEMENT,"Wells Fargo customers who had fake accounts created in their names are a step closer to some payback.

A federal judge granted preliminary approval over the weekend for Wells Fargo's $142 million national class action settlement. The court ruled that the settlement, which covers fake accounts back to 2002, ""fair, reasonable and adequate.""

Victims may still have to wait before they get paid. The bank and lawyers for the plaintiffs plan to reach out to customers in the next three months, but the settlement may not be final until early 2018.

Still, Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan called the court ruling a ""major milestone in our efforts to make things right for our customers.""

Wells Fargo admitted last September that 2 million potentially unauthorized checking and credit card accounts were opened between 2011 and 2015. The bank blamed unrealistic sales goals. The outrage forced the ouster of longtime CEO John Stumpf and the restructuring of Wells Fargo's sales targets, and it spawned federal and local investigations.

Related: Elizabeth Warren wants the Wells Fargo board wiped out

Under an original settlement with regulators in September, Wells Fargo repaid $3.26 million in fees to wronged customers. Since then, the bank has paid $1.8 million more to cover complaints from customers about fake accounts.

The $142 million national settlement is open to customers who claim that Wells Fargo improperly opened checking or savings accounts, credit cards, lines of credit or identity theft services in their names between 2002 and April 2017.

Wells Fargo has also offered to compensate some customers whose credit scores suffered because credit card accounts were secretly opened in their names.

Derek Loeser, a partner at the law firm Keller Rohrback and lead attorney for the plaintiffs, hailed this feature of the settlement as ""groundbreaking"" and ""first-of-its kind.""

The settlement is an important step toward ""holding Wells Fargo accountable for its abuse of customers' trust,"" Loeser said in a statement.

Related: New Wells Fargo scandal over modifying mortgages without consent

The amount that each wronged Wells Fargo customer will receive will vary based on how many fake accounts were opened in their name, how big a financial hit they took and how much money is left in the settlement pool.

The $142 million will first go to lawyer fees and administrative costs. Then Wells Fargo customers will be paid for out-of-pocket losses, such as fees from fake accounts. What's left will be split among all customers, based on how many and what kind of accounts they say were opened.

Wells Fargo has agreed to strengthen the deal: The initial settlement, announced in late March, was worth $110 million. That amount was raised to $142 million in April to expand the settlement to 2002. Wells Fargo's board recently released a report that found evidence of fake accounts going back to ""at least"" that year.

Wells Fargo has agreed to put more money in the settlement fund if less than $25 million is left for wronged customers after paying the lawyers, expenses and out-of-pocket costs.

Customers who believe they were victims don't need to take action yet to be included. More information is available at www.wfsettlement.com, and Wells Fargo has established a hotline at 1-877-924-8697.

A hearing for the court to grant final approval is scheduled for January 4."
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-crimea-power-idUSKBN19V13E,SIEMENS TO PRESS CHARGES AFTER TURBINES MOVED FROM RUSSIA TO CRIMEA,"BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's Siemens (SIEGn.DE) said on Monday at least two of its gas turbines had been moved ""against its will"" from Russia to Crimea, a region subject to sanctions barring EU firms providing it with energy technology.   The European Union imposed the sanctions after Russia's 2014 annexation of the peninsula from Ukraine, a move it sees as breaking international law.  Siemens, which has repeatedly insisted it was not aware the turbines were destined for Crimea, said it would press criminal charges against those responsible for diverting the turbines.  ""Siemens has received information from reliable sources that at least two of the four gas turbine sets, which were delivered for the project in Taman, Southern Russia, have been moved to Crimea against our will,"" it said in a statement.  ""Over the last few months, our customer has confirmed to us numerous times in writing that a delivery to Crimea would not occur. As a consequence, Siemens will initiate criminal charges against the responsible individuals.""  Reuters reported last week that the Siemens turbines had been delivered to Crimea.  A Siemens spokesman said the customer in question was Russian state-owned engineering company Technopromexport, which bought the turbines from Siemens. Technopromexport had no immediate comment, and Russia's energy ministry declined to comment. Vladimir Putin, who is expected to seek reelection as Russian president next year, has vowed to ensure energy security for Crimea, but has no home-grown company that could easily supply such turbines. The Kremlin said on Monday the power turbines being installed in Crimea had been made in Russia using Russian components - an apparent reference to the fact that the turbines were produced at a factory in St. Petersburg. The plant's owner, Siemens Gas Turbine Technologies LLC, is 65 percent owned by Siemens and uses Siemens technology. Siemens - a multinational whose activities include trains,  factory automation and healthcare equipment - will mark 170 years' presence in Russia this year, and invested about 1 billion euros ($1.14 billion) there in the early years of this decade, mostly in energy. Joe Kaeser met Putin several times during his first year as chief executive, including a widely criticized visit to Russia shortly after the annexation of Crimea during which he reaffirmed his commitment to the country. Germany is still one of Russia's top trading partners. A spokesman for the German Economy Ministry, when asked about the Siemens affair on Monday, said that it was up to Siemens to ensure it respected the EU sanctions. The issue has been raised in diplomatic circles in Moscow, a Siemens source familiar with the matter said.  Three sources close to the matter told Reuters last week that Russia's ZAO Interautomatika had been hired to help install the turbines in Crimea. Siemens said on Monday it had expanded investigations by an internal taskforce to all of its Russian-based entities and relevant partners to ensure that no equipment or services could be supplied that could violate export control restrictions. ""This also applies to Siemens' minority stake in Interautomatika,"" it said, adding that Interautomatika had confirmed in writing Siemens' insistence that all relevant activities with respect to Crimea be immediately terminated. Siemens added that it would file lawsuits to halt any further deliveries to Crimea and to return already-dispatched equipment to its original destination. It said it was evaluating what additional actions were possible. The Siemens source had earlier told Reuters that the company was taking legal steps to address the issue.

Editor's Note Ã¢ÂÂ CNN Travel's series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile. However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy.

Hong Kong (CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Once upon a time, Hong Kong dim sum sessions were about tea appreciation -- that's why dim sum meals are commonly known in Cantonese as yum cha (or ""drink tea"").

The baskets of delicate dumplings were a foil for the fragrant drink and considered snacks rather than a full meal.

These days, dim sum itself is a main player on the culinary stage.

The diversity and sheer number of Hong Kong dim sum restaurants is stunning.

Noisy Cantonese joints where people eat with such determination there's a slight madness in the air; gilded, hushed dining rooms where waiters anticipate your every move; tranquil oases hidden on a mountaintop ... it's all available in Hong Kong.

We've picked our favorite Hong Kong dim sum restaurants to make it easy for the food-in-steam-basket fanatics.

Chef Mak Kwai Pui, owner of Hong Kong's most famous dim sum restaurant, shares a few essential dining tips.

Best value: Tim Ho Wan

The secret didn't last long.

When former Lung King Heen chef Mak Kwai-pui (affectionately known as Pui Gor, or ""Brother Pui"") opened a hole-in-the-wall in Mong Kok, crowds flocked here for top-quality Hong Kong dim sum at rock-bottom prices.

Then came a Michelin star. And the masses descended.

A two-hour wait became a daily phenomenon. And that's considered short.

For purists looking for the original experience, Tim Ho Wan's shoebox-sized Mong Kok store has unfortunately closed down.

The good news is Mak's opened six larger locations around Hong Kong -- and many more franchises overseas.

Despite changes, Tim Ho Wan is still worth it, wait and all.

Saying the quality is high and ingredients are fresh is an understatement.

Simply, this is what dim sum is meant to taste like.

The beef balls are firm but tender, with plenty of coriander. The pig liver cheung fun is earthy. The siu mai is packed with fat shrimp and succulent mushrooms. The radish cake actually tastes like the white radish it's made from.

And of course there are the char siu (barbecued pork) baked buns, now widely imitated but never matched.

The Sham Shui Po branch, the second Tim Ho Wan after the Mong Kok store, is still said to house the best chefs.

Best after-hours: San Hing

This is the place to go for a dim sum fix at dawn.

The tables are shared by a mix of elderly folk, celebrities and drinkers on a last stop before home.

Located in Kennedy Town, San Hing technically opens at 3 a.m., though customers arrive earlier to secure seats.

In the small hours the shop is a madhouse, especially on weekends.

Staff frantically churn out a wide selection of dim sum, stacked into giant bamboo towers.

Customers perpetually hover around the food arrival counter, while an unending stream of new customers mill about looking to snatch seats.

Photographs on the wall show Canto-pop star Eason Chan giving props to San Hing's lau sa bao -- signature yellow custard ""quicksand buns.""

Other San Hing specialties include quail's egg siu mai, deep-fried milk and various seasonal dishes often not listed on the menu, such as osmanthus jelly during the summer.

The prices are a bargain, with dim sum dishes ranging from HK$12 to $17 ($1.5-2).

Best for dim sum virgins: Yan Toh Heen

If you're looking for a first and only dim sum experience, there aren't a lot of places that can rival Yan Toh Heen

It was recently upped from one Michelin star to two.

But local dim sum fans have been worshiping it since the 1980s, before the InterContinental hotel took over the space from The Regent in 2001.

Yan Toh Heen Superior Dumplings is the most popular combo -- it includes a dumpling with steamed scallop, black truffles and vegetables, a steamed lobster and bird's nest dumpling and a steamed dumpling with king crab leg and vegetables.

The crispy shrimp with avocado dumplings and mango mayonnaise is fresh and crunchy.

The crispy fried taro net topped with an abalone may be the best deep-fried taro mash in town.

The restaurant also offers a 270-degree Victoria Harbour view.

Food is eaten with exquisite jade tableware.

Best dim sum in style: Mott 32

These siu mai pockets are filled with deliciously runny quail's egg.

The dark and spacious loft-style space underneath a bank building in Hong Kong is nothing like a proper dim sum restaurant -- even the service is kind and attentive.

But we're sold once the barbecued pork arrives.

Mott 32 's char siu uses Iberico pork and is glazed with Yellow Mountain honey. It's perfectly barbecued to give it a mildly charred surface and juicy insides.

The siu mai is made of Kurobuta pork wrapped around a soft-boiled quail's egg.

Sliced garoupa and black truffle are paired in slippery rice rolls.

The xiaolongbao and shrimp dumplings, however, are bland in comparison.

Best VIP treatment: Fook Lam Moon

The first thing we encountered at Fook Lam Moon was a Rolls-Royce Phantom pulling up at the main entrance, dropping off a weary looking man and his two hungry offspring, who bounced noisily to the door of the Hong Kong dim sum restaurant as though they were visiting grandma's house.

It isn't called the ""canteen of the wealthy"" for nothing.

Even though the place is frequented by the rich and famous, anyone can rock up to Fook Lam Moon and feel like a billionaire.

The service is six-star-hotel-perfect without feeling robotic.

They don't over-service because, you know, celebrities just want to be left alone.

But staff have real charm that they turn on for every customer that walks through the doors -- not just wealthy regulars.

Each dim sum gave our taste buds an education.

Har gau (shrimp dumplings) are succulent and juicy, almost to the point of being soupy.

The skins are perfectly translucent.

A signature shrimp cheung fun (rice rolls) has a layer of crisp bean curd sheet to add another dimension of texture to an old standby.

The lau sa bao surpassed our favorites at San Hing.

The bread casing is barely a centimeter thick and the custard filling spills out in an appropriate visual expression of its ""quicksand bun"" name.

Best ""hot, noisy"" atmosphere: Lin Heung Kui

Lin Heung Kui's steamed spare ribs in black bean sauce.

Exported from Guangzhou in the early 20th century, Lin Heung Teahouse in Central has retained a lot of its retro flavor.

But its newer sister store Lin Heung Kui has been gaining momentum among locals since opening in 2009.

Inheriting Lin Heung Teahouse's style and decades-old recipes, Lin Heung Kui produces traditional Cantonese flavors.

Dim sum typical of Lin Heung are siu mai topped with a slab of liver and Chinese sausage rolls -- old-fashioned dishes hard to find anywhere else.

The atmosphere is classic Cantonese.

Harried women push traditional dim sum carts through the dining hall.

Diners rush up to the carts to fight over the bamboo baskets of dim sum that can't seem to come out of the kitchen fast enough.

Service is -- just -- slightly more neighborly and less sour than Lin Heung Teahouse.

However, we find the attitude easy to ignore as we become engulfed in the irrepressibly jovial ""hot and noisy"" atmosphere (yeet lau) favored by Chinese diners.

Best rural experience: Choi Lung Restaurant

Choi Lung Restaurant is a three-story family-run teahouse partway up Hong Kong's highest peak, Tai Mo Shan.

It's a great place to stop during a hike.

Diners have to prepare their own tea and rest on simple plastic stools.

Despite the humble setup, Choi Lung has been running for more than 40 years, thanks to a group of dedicated fans.

""People would drive all the way here from Sai Wan for a bowl of black bean ribs with rice,"" waitress Shek Wai Ling told us a few years ago when we first wrote about the place.

We recommend the bean curd sheet wraps filled with chicken, taro and fish maw.

The taro is cooked lightly with a crunchy outer layer, the chicken is tender and the fish maw is juicy.

A vegetable stall outside Choi Lung's front door is well known for selling locally grown produce.

In November, the restaurant serves fresh watercress purchased directly from the farms nearby, which Shek said are ""very sweet and rarely found.""

It's best to visit Choi Lung on the weekend as some dim sum are not served on weekdays, such as the black sesame rolls.

Choi Lung Restaurant, 2 Chuen Lung Estate, Route Twisk, Tsuen Wan, Hong Kong; +852 2415 5041. To get there, take a taxi from Tsuen Wan station for around HK$60 or take minibus 80 at Chuen Lung Street near Tsuen Wan wet market.

Best vegetarian option: Pure Veggie House

A hand-painted Buddhist Heart Sutra hangs on the wall.

Proving that great vegetarian dim sum isn't an oxymoron, you won't even notice the lack of meat when eating at Pure Veggie House

Unlike most vegetarian Chinese restaurants, Pure Veggie House doesn't offer imitation meat made with bean curd and mushrooms.

Pure Veggie House prides itself on its lack of artificial coloring and MSG.

The addictive, bite-sized siu mai is our favorite -- it consists of sticky rice and spinach.

Mushroom dumplings are pocketed with fragrant truffles.

You can also opt for brown rice instead of the usual white variety to make it extra healthy.

The ownership group also manages an eco-farm, which supplies some of the restaurant's vegetables.

Best sense of community: Lam Kee

There's something about the tile floors, high ceilings and boisterous atmosphere of a wet market food hall that makes a meal even more fun.

Located in the Tai Po Hui Market's food court, Lam Kee is a casual neighborhood Hong Kong dim sum spot with simple, delicious fare.

The portions are small but inexpensive -- most cost less than HK$10 (US$1.30), which allows for plenty of experimentation.

Particularly memorable are the bean curd wraps, which contain an assortment of ingredients that work together remarkably well, like baby corn, taro, chicken and spam.

The black bean spareribs are fantastic and so are the tiny har gau.

But the best part of any meal is the company.

At the Tai Po Hui food court, patrons sit in a communal dining area.

Neighbors bump into each other as they head to the food stalls for a break during a grocery run.

If it's early morning, older women fuel up for an afternoon of mahjong by chatting over pots of tea.

Lam Kee, shop 8-9, 2/F, Tai Po Hui Market Cooked Food Centre, Tai Po

Best power lunch: Lung King Heen

Individual steam baskets -- now that's how you respect dim sum.

As one of Hong Kong's few Michelin three-starred restaurants and a Four Seasons Hotel signature, Lung King Heen enjoys an elevated status.

It's the perfect setting for special occasions: harbor views, central location, crease-free white tablecloths.

This is dim sum as fine dining. The menu is full of classics that have been given novel twists.

Lobster and scallop in a thin wrapper resemble decadent siu mai. Cheung fun is filled with garoupa. Dumplings are stuffed with duck liver.

The hotel atmosphere can't be dismissed.

The service is a little mechanical and halfway through the meal we start craving the controlled chaos of a typical Cantonese restaurant.

But Lung King Heen isn't a typical Cantonese restaurant.

Book ahead.

Best way to get fat: Tai Wing Wah

Don't bother counting calories at Tai Wing Wah.

Sure, we live in a world obsessed with staying slim.

But in Yuen Long, Tai Wing Wah is making a killing from hearty ""walled village cuisine"" made with lard.

Punti and Hakka villages, settled in Hong Kong during the Ming and Qing dynasties, were protected by high village walls.

The food originating from these walled villages is the focus of Tai Wing Wah's menu.

Hugo ""To To"" Leung is the culinary brains behind the restaurant and he's adamant about maintaining authenticity.

That means, apart from Hong Kong dim sum classics, such as excellent har gau, or a bright yellow and delicious Malay sponge cake, Tai Wing Wah also serves a rustic white rice mixed with lard and soy sauce that'll leave you wanting more.

If you get a table and order before 11 a.m., most of the dim sum costs HK$12.

Best unpretentiously posh: Lei Garden

It's Michelin-starred and a haunt for celebrity families, but the atmosphere at this Hong Kong dim sum restaurant is relaxed and unpretentious.

Offering superbly executed Cantonese dishes and extremely popular for its dim sum, Lei Garden also stands out for warm service.

It's rumored the wait staff are trained more vigorously and compensated more handsomely than at any other Cantonese restaurant chain in town.

The plain cheung fun are al dente at first bite and perfectly tender inside; the siu mei is moist and meaty, with a nice crisp snap to the skin of the siu yuk and roasted duck.

Lei Garden's har gau are stuffed with fat shrimp and expertly wrapped.

Essentially, it's a procession of Hong Kong dim sum hits, with only a few slight misses, like the underwhelming xiaolongbao.

Lei Garden Restaurant , 121 Sai Yee St., Mong Kok, Hong Kong; multiple locations

Best cinematic backdrop: Luk Yu Teahouse

Luk Yu's diverse menu includes plenty of hard-to-find dishes.

Central's Luk Yu Teahouse offers old Hong Kong glamor with art deco styling, a retro menu and a rich history.

It's no wonder it regularly appears in movies and literature.

Opened in 1933, Luk Yu Teahouse relocated to its current location in 1976.

The building's colonial facade opens into a three-floor restaurant dripping with nostalgia.

Eating at Luk Yu is like falling through a time warp.

A dim sum meal easily averages more than HK$100 per person per meal.

Some customers are paying for the teahouse's history and ambiance.

Others are long-term patrons who stay all day.

Hard-to-find items harkening back four or five decades make up the menu, such as excellent liver siu mai and deep-fried dumplings in soup.

Service is notoriously bad and wait staff can be intimidating to non-regulars.

So much so that customer neglect has become a signature of the restaurant.

Dim sum dining tips

First-time dim sum sessions can be intimidating, especially in a ""yeet lau"" Cantonese diner like Lin Heung Kui.

Servers don't necessarily speak English and it's often loud and chaotic.

Here are some tips and useful hand signals you can use to yum cha like a pro.

1. Be squeaky clean

The beginning of every dim sum session is when you embrace your inner clean freak.

Once diners are seated, they roll up their sleeves and start rinsing utensils at the table.

First, pour some hot tea (it's the best grease remover) into the big bowl provided, dip your cup into it sideways and spin it.

Then, scoop some tea with your washed cup and pour it over the chopsticks.

Empty all the tea into the larger collecting bowl.

2. How to order

There are three main types of dim sum restaurants.

At the traditional ones, dim sum is rolled around on carts. Diners just have to watch for the right cart and grab their desired dim sum.

However, nowadays most teahouses provide dim sum ordering forms.

Check off the types of dim sum and write in the number of baskets you want.

Circle your orders to make sure they don't get lost in the long list of choices.

Then hoist it in the air to show you're ready.

In more upscale restaurants, waiters take orders off regular menus.

3. Master your chopstick skills

What should you do when there are just three pieces of lau sa bao between the six of you?

Apart from ordering another basket of dim sum, a Cantonese person will tell you sharing is the right way to go -- it allows you to save stomach space to sample more dishes.

Tear a bun with your fingers -- forget about the cleanliness we just mentioned.

You can split smaller dim sum by crossing your chopsticks.

4. Tap two fingers for ""thank you""

In most high-end teahouses, waiters will refill your teacup with hot tea before it's empty.

In other situations, the youngest person at the table is often entrusted with the task.

You don't lift a hot teapot without pouring tea for others as well -- and always pour for others first.

When being served, you just have to tap your index finger and your middle finger in front of your cup to show gratitude.

5. Empty pot?

By lifting the lid of a teapot and hanging it on the handle, or simply on the table, you send a signal that you need a hot water refill.

6. ""Maai daan!""

To get the bill, raise your hand with your index finger pointing downward, then twirl it like you're drawing a circle in the air.

Or simply shout ""maai daan"" (in Cantonese it literally means ""closing the bill"").

Most importantly, don't be shy and say ""Mm goi"" (thanks) whenever you can."

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-07/russians-are-said-to-be-suspects-in-hacks-involving-nuclear-site,"RUSSIANS ARE SUSPECTS IN NUCLEAR SITE HACKINGS, SOURCES SAY","Hackers working for a foreign government recently breached at least a dozen U.S. power plants, including the Wolf Creek nuclear facility in Kansas, according to current and former U.S. officials, sparking concerns the attackers were searching for vulnerabilities in the electrical grid.The intruders could be positioning themselves to eventually disrupt the nations power supply, warned the officials, who noted that a general alert was distributed to utilities a week ago. Adding to those concerns, hackers recently infiltrated an unidentified company that makes control systems for equipment used in the power industry, an attack that officials believe may be related.The chief suspect is Russia, according to three people familiar with the continuing effort to eject the hackers from the computer networks. One of those networks belongs to an aging nuclear generating facility known as Wolf Creek -- owned by Westar Energy Inc., Great Plains Energy Inc. and Kansas Electric Power Cooperative Inc. -- on a lake shore near Burlington, Kansas.The possibility of a Russia connection is particularly worrisome, former and current officials say, because Russian hackers have previously taken down parts of the electrical grid in Ukraine and appear to be testing increasingly advanced tools to disrupt power supplies.The hacks come as international tensions have flared over U.S. intelligence agencies conclusion that Russia tried to influence the 2016 presidential election. The U.S., which has several continuing investigations into Russias activities, is known to possess digital weapons capable of disrupting the electricity grids of rival nations.We dont pay attention to such anonymous fakes, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, in response to a request to comment on alleged Russian involvement.It was unclear whether President Donald Trump was planning to address the cyberattacks at his meeting on Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In an earlier speech in Warsaw, Trump called out Russias destabilizing activities and urged the country to join the community of responsible nations.The Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation said they are aware of a potential intrusion in the energy sector. The alert issued to utilities cited activities by hackers since May.There is no indication of a threat to public safety, as any potential impact appears to be limited to administrative and business networks, the government agencies said in a joint statement.The Department of Energy also said the impact appears limited to administrative and business networks and said it was working with utilities and grid operators to enhance security and resilience.Regardless of whether malicious actors attempt to exploit business networks or operational systems, we take any reports of malicious cyber activity potentially targeting our nations energy infrastructure seriously and respond accordingly, the department said in an emailed statement.Representatives of the National Security Council, the Director of National Intelligence and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission declined to comment. While Bloomberg News was waiting for responses from the government, the New York Times reported that hacks were targeting nuclear power stations.The North American Electric Reliability Corp., a nonprofit that works to ensure the reliability of the continents power system, said it was aware of the incident and was exchanging information with the industry through a secure portal. At this time, there has been no bulk power system impact in North America, the corporation said in an emailed statement.In addition, the operational controls at Wolf Creek were not pierced, according to government officials. There was absolutely no operational impact to Wolf Creek, Jenny Hageman, a spokeswoman for the nuclear plant, said in a statement to Bloomberg News. The reason that is true is because the operational computer systems are completely separate from the corporate network.Determining who is behind an attack can be tricky. Government officials look at the sophistication of the tools, among other key markers, when gauging whether a foreign government is sponsoring cyber activities.Several private security firms are studying data on the attacks, but none has linked the work to a particular hacking team or country.We dont tie this to any known group at this point, said Sean McBride, a lead analyst for FireEye Inc., a global cybersecurity firm. Its not to say its not related, but we dont have the evidence at this point.U.S. intelligence officials have long been concerned about the security of the countrys electrical grid. The recent attack, striking almost simultaneously at multiple locations, is testing the governments ability to coordinate an effective response among several private utilities, state and local officials, and industry regulators.Specialized teams from Homeland Security and the FBI have been scrambled to help extricate the hackers from the power stations, in some cases without informing local and state officials. Meanwhile, the U.S. National Security Agency is working to confirm the identity of the hackers, who are said to be using computer servers in Germany, Italy, Malaysia and Turkey to cover their tracks.Many of the power plants are conventional, but the targeting of a nuclear facility adds to the pressure. While the core of a nuclear generator is heavily protected, a sudden shutdown of the turbine can trigger safety systems. These safety devices are designed to disperse excess heat while the nuclear reaction is halted, but the safety systems themselves may be vulnerable to attack.Homeland Security and the FBI sent out a general warning about the cyberattack to utilities and related parties on June 28, though it contained few details or the number of plants affected. The government said it was most concerned about the persistence of the attacks on choke points of the U.S. power supply. That language suggests hackers are trying to establish backdoors on the plants systems for later use, according to a former senior DHS official who asked not to be identified.Those backdoors can be used to insert software specifically designed to penetrate a facilitys operational controls and disrupt critical systems, according to Galina Antova, co-founder of Claroty, a New York firm that specializes in securing industrial control systems.Were moving to a point where a major attack like this is very, very possible, Antova said. Once youre into the control systems -- and you can get into the control systems by hacking into the plants regular computer network -- then the basic security mechanisms youd expect are simply not there.The situation is a little different at nuclear facilities. Backup power supplies and other safeguards at nuclear sites are meant to ensure that you cant really cause a nuclear plant to melt down just by taking out the secondary systems that are connected to the grid, Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a phone interview.The operating systems at nuclear plants also tend to be legacy controls built decades ago and dont have digital control systems that can be exploited by hackers. Wolf Creek, for example, began operations in 1985. Theyre relatively impervious to that kind of attack, Lyman said.The alert sent out last week inadvertently identified Wolf Creek as one of the victims of the attack. An analysis of one of the tools used by the hackers had the stolen credentials of a plant employee, a senior engineer. A U.S. official acknowledged the error was not caught until after the alert was distributed.According to a security researcher who has seen the report, the malware that activated the engineers username and password was designed to be used once the hackers were already inside the plants computer systems.The tool tries to connect to non-public computers, and may have been intended to identify systems related to Wolf Creeks generation plant, a part of the facility typically more modern than the nuclear reactor control room, according to a security expert who asked to note be identified because the alert is not public.Even if there is no indication that the hackers gained access to those control systems, the design of the malware suggests they may have at least been looking for ways to do so, the expert said.Stan Luke, the mayor of Burlington, the largest community near Wolf Creek, which is surrounded by corn fields and cattle pastures, said he learned about a cyber threat at the plant only recently, and then only through golfing buddies.With a population of just 2,700, Burlington boasts a community pool with three water slides and a high school football stadium that would be the envy of any junior college. Luke said those amenities lead back to the tax dollars poured into the community by Wolf Creek, Coffey Countys largest employer with some 1,000 workers, 600 of whom live in the county.E&E News first reported on digital attacks targeting U.S. nuclear plants, adding it was code-named Nuclear 17. A senior U.S. official told Bloomberg that there was a bigger breach of conventional plants, which could affect multiple regions.Industry experts and U.S. officials say the attack is being taken seriously, in part because of recent events in Ukraine. Antova said that the Ukrainian power grid has been disrupted at least twice, first in 2015, and then in a more automated attack last year, suggesting the hackers are testing methods.Scott Aaronson, executive director for security and business continuity at the Edison Electric Institute, an industry trade group, said utilities, grid operators and federal officials were already dissecting the attack on Ukraines electric sector to apply lessons in North America before the U.S. government issued the latest warning to energy and critical manufacturing sectors. The current threat is unrelated to recently publicized ransomware incidents or the CrashOverride malware, Aaronson said in an emailed statement.Neither attack in Ukraine caused long-term damage. But with each escalation, the hackers may be gauging the worlds willingness to push back.If you think about a typical war, some of the acts that have been taken against critical infrastructure in Ukraine and even in the U.S., those would be considered crossing red lines, Antova said.For more on cyber security, check out the Decrypted podcast: "

Opioid medications bind to the areas of the brain that control pain and emotions, driving up levels of the feel-good hormone dopamine in the brain's reward areas and producing an intense feeling of euphoria.



As the brain becomes used to the feelings, it often takes more and more of the drug to produce the same levels of pain relief and well-being, leading to dependence and, later, addiction. Hide Caption 1 of 12

Because it decreases activity in the part of the brain that controls coughing, it's frequently mixed with other liquids to develop cough syrups for colds and flu. It has frequently been used for pain relief after removal of tonsils and adenoids in children.



After an investigation, the FDA restricted the use of codeine and tramadol in children under 12 and recommend against their use in children between 12 and 18 years of age. Additionally, the FDA has warned breastfeeding mothers not to take these medications due to the risk of serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants. Hide Caption 3 of 12

(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Spending the night at an airport isn't usually an aspirational sleeping arrangement.

That was before someone transformed the original flight control tower at Stockholm Arlanda Airport into a luxury apartment.

The disused tower is now home to a spacious, bright space complete with panoramic views of the runways below.

1960s chic

The airport control tower is now a chic, minimalistic apartment space.

Arlanda has partnered with vacation rental company HomeAway and Swedavia to reinvent the 80-meter-high tower as a destination that'll appeal to aviation geeks, design freaks -- pretty much everyone else.

Swedish multimedia artist Cilla Ramnek is the brains behind the aparment's Scandi-cool, minimalistic look.

(CNN) Imagine beating rush hour traffic jams by zipping from A to B in the air.

While flying cars have regularly made appearances in science fiction films, they could soon become reality.

A group of Japanese inventors is working on an ambitious plan to launch a flying car, the SkyDrive, by the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo

The Cartivator Project , a Tokyo-based non-profit, is leading the futuristic pursuit, and it has a special ambition for the vehicle.

""SkyDrive is our first flying concept designed solely to (transport the person who will) light the Olympic flame,"" Ryutaro Mori, Cartivator's business director, tells CNN.

If successful, the SkyDrive -- which has three wheels, four rotors and uses drone technology -- would fly at an altitude of 33 feet (10 meters), reach top airborne speeds of 62 miles (100 kilometers) per hour, and zoom along at 93 miles (150 kilometers) per hour on land.

At 9.5 feet (290 centimeters) long, 4.2 feet (130 centimeters) wide and 3.6 feet (110 centimeters) high, Cartivator claims the one-seater would be the world's smallest flying car -- and surely a snug ride for some passengers.

But with companies in the United States, United Arab Emirates, Germany, Netherlands and China also trying to develop a flying car, the Japanese have competition.

Passion takes flight

Cartivator was founded in 2012 by Tsubasa Nakamura, 32, after he won first prize at business award KoreaRata for a flying car design.

By 2014, the SkyDrive concept was born and a scale model one-fifth the intended size of the actual flying car had been tested, according to the company website

The team has since begun testing with an experimental model that's more similar to the real SkyDrive in scale and weight.

Today, the project has 30 volunteers from backgrounds as diverse as the automobile, aviation and IT industries. They plan to have a remote-piloted prototype running by summer 2018.

Cartivator's engineers work on the SkyDrive.

""For a highly complex system like flying cars, the success highly depends on the integration of multidisciplinary knowledge and experiences,"" Mori tells CNN. ""Our unique advantage is that we, as a nonprofit, volunteer organization, encourage open-source collaborations.""

Team members sustain full-time jobs, and work on SkyDrive in their spare time.

While they receive no financial support from the government, last month Japanese automobile giant Toyota announced it would give 40 million yen ($365,260) to the project.

""This is not an equity investment as we are a nonprofit organization,"" Mori explains.

Before that, the team had relied on crowdfunding, an avenue they are still keen to expand.

""Our goal won't be realized unless there are many public supporters who strongly wish our presence at the Olympics.""

Tough competition

Cartivator faces stiff competition in the flying car market.

Dubai's Road and Transport Authority (RTA) has said it is ready to launch a fleet of one-seater passenger drones made by Chinese company Ehang in July.

Small enough to fit into a car parking space when folded up, the electrically powered driverless drones -- named Ehang 184 -- have already been seen hovering above the sand dunes near the city's airfield during test flights.

Powered by eight propellers, Ehang says the 184 (which stands for one person, eight propellers, four arms) will cruise at around 62 miles (100 kilometers) per hour.

The routes will be programmed by a ground control center through an encrypted 4G network which will monitor the flight.

Perhaps hedging its bets, Dubai has also partnered with American ride-sharing app firm Uber, which recently unveiled Uber Elevate , an ambitious plan to launch a flying taxi that could travel at 150 miles (241 kilometers) per hour. It intends to launch in the emirate in time for it hosting the World Fair 2020.

Uber says it is talking with NASA, the FAA, and the National Air Traffic Control Association to develop an air-traffic control system for flying cars.

Elsewhere, startups and conglomerates alike are developing prototypes of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircrafts.

AeroMobil , a Slovakian engineering firm established in 2010, launched in April the latest version of its flying car concept -- a four-wheeled vehicle equipped with flight mode. Consumers will be able to pre-order the cars this year.

Kitty Hawk -- a US startup backed by Google co-founder Larry Page -- gave a demonstration of its Flyer earlier this year. The personal aircraft is designed to fly over water, with a consumer product set to be available by the end of 2017.

Meanwhile, French aerospace giant Airbus is working on multiple eVTOL concepts: Vahana, which holds one passenger, is set to fly at the end of 2017; the CityAirbus, which accommodates four passengers, will see its first flight at the end of 2018.

Ready for takeoff?

The Cartivator team is aiming to deliver SkyDrive's first commercial model by 2025.

But some experts believe the Japanese team -- and their rivals -- still have way to go to deliver a viable and, crucially, safe product.

""There is a big difference between getting something into the air, and getting it into the market,"" Mike Hirschberg, executive director of AHS International , the US-based international society for engineers and scientists working to advance vertical flight, tells CNN.

""There are years of aircraft development, changes in regulations, building of infrastructure, battery improvements, etc, before anything like 'flying taxis' can become a reality, even on a small scale.""

There is a big difference between getting something into the air, and getting it into the market. Mike Hirschberg, executive director, AHS International

There are technical concerns, too.

""Key issues are getting the weight right. If (it's) too heavy, the machine loses stability,"" Geoffrey Tudor, principal analyst at Japan Aviation Management Research, tells CNN.

""Airborne vehicles are more sensitive to weather than surface types so there will be some limits on use in bad weather.""

Mori admits that they might not be ahead of the game.

""As far as we know, Japan as a whole is currently behind other countries in developing flying cars,"" he tells CNN.

""However, we believe what matters more is who will provide the greatest value and build a sustainable business in the long term -- rather than 'getting there first'.""

The future

Despite Cartivator's reservations, Japan has a history of being the first to roll out world-class innovations in transport.

The first high-speed bullet train was unveiled in Tokyo in 1964 -- in time for the Summer Olympics hosted that year in the Japanese capital.

More recently in 2016, a Japan Railway maglev train smashed world records reaching speeds of 374 miles (603 kilometers) per hour.

Meanwhile, the Japanese government has announced its intention for Tokyo to become a self-driving city by 2020 -- Tokyo-based Dynamic Map Planning, an offshoot of Mitsubishi Electric, mapmaker Zenrin and nine automakers have been tasked with creating dynamic 3D maps of Tokyo for use by automated vehicles.

Cartivator is hoping to see their invention used to light the Olympic torch -- as shown in a rendering here.

""Japan does have a large pool of highly trained scientists and engineers working in industry and academia, who can tackle the development of new systems and machines,"" says Tudor.

But for an eVTOL business to be successful, ""it has to have compelling capabilities over competing means of travel at a competitive price,"" Hirschberg says.

The other critical factor is community acceptance. ""In addition to cost, speed and ease of use, noise is probably the biggest factor for acceptance.""

For Cartivator, it's a work in progress.

""We believe it is realistic for flying cars to become commonly used, if we solve issues like noise, safety, and accessibility,"" Mori says.

""Aside from us, a number of companies and communities have been working closely to tackle those issues through technological and business model innovations.

""We are determined to do whatever it takes to be at the Olympics."""

http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/10/media/white-house-correspondents-association-breitbart-news/index.html?section=money_topstories,WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS ASSOCIATION CONSIDERS RULE CHANGE THAT COULD ICE OUT BREITBART,"A proposed change to the White House Correspondents Association's bylaws could keep Breitbart News reporters out of the group's decision-making process.

The WHCA is set to vote this week on a measure that would require its ""regular members"" -- those who vote and hold elective office within the group -- to be credentialed through the Congressional Standing Committee, or to work with or for an organization that is.

That could effectively mean barring reporters with Breitbart, which earlier this year was denied congressional press passes, from that level of membership in the WHCA.

Charlie Spiering, Breitbart's White House correspondent, was one of six journalists who signed a letter opposing the bylaw change that was circulated to WHCA members over the weekend.

""The WHCA Board has in most cases done a great job in advocating for journalists' access, and showing respect to all members. The proposed bylaws change regarding membership is an unfortunate exception,"" the group said in the letter. ""That's because the bylaws change would mean some members and hard pass holders who regularly cover the White House will not have full participation in the organization that is supposed to represent them regarding access among other things.""

The letter was also signed by liberal commentator Bill Press and longtime White House correspondent Connie Lawn, along with reporters for conservative outlets Newsmax, Circa and The Daily Signal. The signatories urged their colleagues to vote no on the proposal or, alternatively, asked the WHCA to consider grandfathering in existing regular members.

The deadline for members to vote on the bylaw change is Friday. Members will also have an opportunity to debate the proposal at a town hall meeting on Monday evening.

Press, a regular member of the WHCA whose membership would not be affected by the change, told CNN that ""there's a lot of unrest among members"" over the proposal. He and other opponents have asked for the vote to be postponed.

Jeff Mason, a White House correspondent for Reuters who is president of the WHCA, told CNN that the Congressional Standing Committee is the ""gold standard"" for credentialing in Washington, D.C.

The WHCA is not in charge of granting credentials at the White House, but it advocates for press access to the White House, provides scholarships for some journalism students and is perhaps best known for sponsoring its annual dinner every spring.

Mason said that the WHCA does not issue credentials, and that the rules for associate members will not change.

The letter opposing the proposal noted that associate members cannot vote in board elections or for future bylaw changes, among other disadvantages.

""Whether it's eligibility for pool coverage, competing for a journalism awards, qualifying to apply for a briefing room seat or work space, an associate member has fewer opportunities for access than a Full Member,"" the letter said.

Mason said that the change ""would affect a small handful of regular members.""

""We gave all of them a heads up,"" he said. ""We've also given them a chance to voice their opposition in a public way.""

One member who might be affected is Spiering.

That's because Breitbart was denied permanent congressional press passes in April over concerns about its ties to both the Mercer family, who are Republican benefactors and part owners of the right-wing outlet, and to the Government Accountability Institute, a conservative nonprofit that was co-founded by former Breitbart chairman and current White House strategist Steve Bannon.

At that time, the Standing Committee of Correspondents of the Senate Press Gallery said it tabled Breitbart's application until it could prove that it met the requirements under a rule requiring publications to be ""editorially independent of any institution, foundation or interest group that lobbies the federal government, or that is not principally a general news organization."""
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-g20-germany-communique-idUSKBN19T07P,U.S. ISOLATED ON CLIMATE AT SUMMIT OF WORLD LEADERS,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - Leaders from the world's leading economies broke with U.S. President Donald Trump on climate policy at a G20 summit on Saturday, in a rare public admission of disagreement and blow to multilateral cooperation. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, keen to show off her skills as a mediator two months before a German election, achieved her primary goal at the meeting in Hamburg, convincing her fellow leaders to support a single communique with pledges on trade, finance, energy and Africa. But the divide between Trump, elected on a pledge to put ""America First"", and the 19 other members of the club, including countries as diverse as Japan, Saudi Arabia and Argentina, was stark. Last month Trump announced he was pulling the United States out of a landmark international climate accord clinched two years ago in Paris. ""In the end, the negotiations on climate reflect dissent  all against the United States of America,"" Merkel told reporters at the end of the meeting. ""And the fact that negotiations on trade were extraordinarily difficult is due to specific positions that the United States has taken.""  The summit, marred by violent protests that left the streets of Hamburg littered with burning cars and broken shop windows, brought together a volatile mix of leaders at a time of major change in the global geo-political landscape. Trump's shift to a more unilateral, transactional diplomacy has left a void in global leadership, unsettling traditional allies in Europe and opening the door to rising powers like China to assume a bigger role. Tensions between Washington and Beijing dominated the run-up to the meeting, with the Trump administration ratcheting up pressure on President Xi Jinping to rein in North Korea and threatening punitive trade measures on steel. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time in Hamburg, a hotly anticipated encounter after the former real estate mogul promised a rapprochement with Moscow during his campaign, only to be thwarted by accusations of Russian meddling in the vote and investigations into the Russia ties of Trump associates. Putin said at the conclusion of the summit on Saturday that Trump had quizzed him on the alleged meddling in a meeting that lasted over two hours but seemed to have been satisfied with the Kremlin leader's denials of interference. Trump had accused Russia of destabilizing behavior in Ukraine and Syria before the summit. But in Hamburg he struck a conciliatory tone, describing it as an honor to meet Putin and signaling, through Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, that he preferred to focus on future ties and not dwell on the past. ""It was an extraordinarily important meeting,"" Tillerson said, describing a ""very clear positive chemistry"" between Trump and the former KGB agent. In the final communique, the 19 other leaders took note of the U.S. decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord and declared it ""irreversible"". For its part, the United States injected a contentious line saying that it would ""endeavor to work closely with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently."" French President Emmanuel Macron led a push to soften the U.S. language. ""There is a clear consensus absent the United States,"" said Thomas Bernes, a distinguished fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation. ""But that is a problem. Without the largest economy in the world how far can you go?""  Jennifer Morgan, executive director at Greenpeace, said the G19 had ""held the line"" against Trump's ""backward decision"" to withdraw from Paris. On trade, another sticking point, the leaders agreed they would ""fight protectionism including all unfair trade practices and recognize the role of legitimate trade defense instruments in this regard."" The leaders also pledged to work together to foster economic development in Africa, a priority project for Merkel. Merkel chose to host the summit in Hamburg, the port city where she was born, to send a signal about Germany's openness to the world, including its tolerance of peaceful protests. It was held only a few hundred meters from one of Germany's most potent symbols of left-wing resistance, a former theater called the ""Rote Flora"" which was taken over by anti-capitalist squatters nearly three decades ago. Over the three days of the summit, radicals looted shops, torched cars and lorries. More than 200 police were injured and some 143 people have been arrested and 122 taken into custody. Some of the worst damage was done as Merkel hosted other leaders at for a concert and lavish dinner at the Elbphilharmonie, a modernist glass concert hall overlooking the Elbe River.  Merkel met police and security force after the summit to thank them, and condemned the ""unbridled brutality"" of some of the protestors, but she was forced to answer tough questions about hosting the summit in Hamburg during her closing press conference.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-oncor-m-a-elliott-idUSKBN19V1JM,ELLIOTT PROPOSES $18.5 BILLION ONCOR DEAL TO TOP BUFFETT,"(Reuters) - Elliott Management Corp, the largest creditor of the bankrupt parent of Oncor Electric Delivery Co, unveiled a plan on Monday to best Berkshire Hathaway Inc's (BRKa.N) deal for the Texas utility with a bid worth $18.5 billion, including debt. Elliott revealed in documents published on its website it was unhappy with the recovery to some creditors under an $18.1 billion deal announced by billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire on Friday. The hedge fund believes its acquisition offer would result in a higher payout to debtholders. New York-based Elliott's proposal to acquire Energy Future Holdings Corp calls for a complex conversion of its debt to equity and for an outside equity partner to help finance the deal. Reuters first reported on Elliott exploring a bid for Oncor on Friday. The offer from the hedge fund, which says it has more than $32 billion under management, would be a rare challenge to Buffett, who avoids auctions for companies and has told his investors he does not like to participate in bidding wars. But even without a competing bid, Buffett's deal faces a difficult road securing the approval of a bankruptcy court judge without Elliott supporting it.  ""We are extremely concerned that introducing a transaction with Berkshire at the current time will significantly undercut and potentially limit Elliott's ability to provide a portion of the financing necessary to achieve the higher and otherwise superior transaction Elliott has proposed,"" the hedge fund said in a letter to the board of Energy Future dated July 5 and released on Monday. Berkshire's offer would help Energy Future exit its costly bankruptcy, which has stretched for over three years as other deals for its crown jewel Oncor fell apart. Energy Future's power generation and retail electricity business were separated from Oncor and emerged from bankruptcy last year. Elliott, run by billionaire Paul Singer, also disclosed on Monday that it would keep in place a corporate ""ringfencing"" structure that would prevent debt from being added to Dallas-based Oncor, or too much cash being paid out as dividends.  Regulators in the utility's home state of Texas have demanded such a structure. That was the reason Florida utility NextEra Energy Inc's (NEE.N) $18.7 billion deal for the utility collapsed earlier this year. Berkshire Hathaway already has reached an agreement on a consensual approval process with regulators, according to a statement from an adviser to Energy Future filed in bankruptcy court. Oncor did not immediately comment on Elliott's letter, while Berkshire was not immediately available for comment. Elliott declined to comment. Elliott's disclosures came after Energy Future filed its new bankruptcy plan of reorganization on Friday. It proposed repaying the unsecured debt that Elliott holds at 18 cents on the dollar.  Should Elliott succeed in its offer for Energy Future its unsecured debt would have a recovery of 50 cents on the dollar, according to people familiar with the matter. Elliott holds $2.9 billion of Energy Future's secured and unsecured debt, enough to try to block the reorganization plan with Berkshire, the people said.  Elliott built up most of its position in Energy Future's debt after Texas regulators rejected NextEra's offer earlier this year, causing bond prices to crash, the sources said. The hedge fund would break even on its debt investment if the Berkshire bid prevails because gains in some parts of its debt holdings, which would be paid out in full, would offset losses in the unsecured bonds it holds, where it would take a deep haircut, the people said. Elliott, known for its aggressive tactics including a 12-year battle over sovereign debt in Argentina, also may pursue litigation to block the deal, the sources said.  Elliott said in the letter it would support a deal with Berkshire or a third party if those bids exceeded the value proposed by the hedge fund. ""We fear that the Berkshire transaction does not provide such value,"" the hedge fund said in the letter. Oncor delivers power to more than 3.4 million homes and businesses through roughly 122,000 miles (196,000 km) of transmission and distribution lines.

Hundreds of homes evacuated in Santa Barbara County

(CNN) Wildfires burning through California left children at a summer camp temporarily stranded and forced campers to leave behind tents and boats to escape the flames.

In Santa Barbara County, the Whittier Fire began Saturday and quickly expanded within hours, burning over 5,000 acres, county spokeswoman Gina DePinto said.

The blaze, which is close to Los Padres National Forest, is burning on both sides of highway 154 near the San Marcos Pass.

At least 2,000 people were evacuated Saturday, including at least 60 campers -- most of them children-- who were attending the Circle V Ranch, a popular summer camp program in the area, DePinto said.

http://cnn.com/2017/07/05/health/grenfell-tower-fire-psychology-of-survival-eprise/index.html,LONDON FIRE: LEARNING TO SURVIVE WHEN YOU LOSE EVERYTHING,"London (CNN) The tower looms over West London, a stark reminder of the tragedy that took place three weeks ago.

Black, broken, almost fragile in appearance, Grenfell Tower's 24 storeys stand tall against the bare sky that surrounds it.

Miguel Alves stares up at the 13th floor, his face falling as he points out his home -- now hardly recognizable.

Empty spaces highlight where windows were once fixed. On the windowsill sits what he says look like the remains of vases, but without the flowers he used to tend.

Gone are the small treasures from raising his family of four.

Alves recalls how he would stare out of these windows, rather than up at them, looking down on the neighborhood as he stood his kitchen.

""It was my palace. ... I was happy there,"" Alves said.

Now, life has become a surreal sequence of events, a haze in which he and his family simply push through in hopes of moving on and rebuilding their lives.

""It's like a dream that I didn't wake up (from) yet,"" the 49-year-old said.

But he also feels lucky, because his whole family managed to escape the inferno that destroyed the building and killed scores of his neighbors.

""A lot of people, they didn't have my luck to come out in time, and I feel for them,"" he said.

has claimed at least 80 lives, The fire, which started on June 14 in a refrigerator on the fourth floor,hasclaimed at least 80 lives, according to the UK's Metropolitan Police.

Blessings of fate

The night of the fire, Alves and his wife, Fatima, had dinner with family members visiting from out of town -- something that was unusual for them. They returned home about 1 a.m., just as the fire began, and shared the elevator with someone who just happened to press the button for the fourth story up.

As the doors opened, they saw smoke seeping into the hallway from the burgeoning blaze.

Flames and smoke engulfed Grenfell Tower on June 14.

Sending his wife back to the car to get his phone, Alves walked up the remaining nine floors to his apartment and collected his two children Tiago, 20, and Ines, 16, to get them all outside, just in case the fire grew worse.

They now believe the events of that night were a miracle, with fate ensuring that they saw the signs to make an early escape. They escaped with just a phone, his son's wallet and his daughter's school notes. She went on to take her exam the next day.

But now, three weeks later, it hurts coming back to his home, he said, seeing his former palace destroyed. ""It's difficult to cope,"" he said.

Despite the pain, Alves comes back every day, he admits, on autopilot mostly, having returned here every day for the past 19 years. ""It's automatic. The first thing I do is come around here. ... It's still my home.""

The Alves family -- Tiago, Fatima, Ines and Miguel -- are active members of their church.

Life in limbo

Leaving the tower behind, Alves goes to his current home: a small hotel room.

His family resides here with more than 10 other residents of the tower block while the local council government works to rehouse the hundreds left homeless.

Alves has lived here for just over two weeks, sharing a room with his wife while their two children sleep in a room on another floor.

""We need to feel as a family,"" he said. ""To talk to (our kids), we have to ask them to come to our room or we go to their room, and that is not ideal.""

Just a few clothes fill the wardrobe and a small suitcase that sits on the floor.

A single suitcase accompanies a few clothes in the wardrobe of the Alveses' hotel room.

""We have lost everything, even small socks that we like the most or a pair of shoes we are missing from everyday life,"" Alves said.

The desk is littered with snacks, breakfast bars and water for emergencies, as they live without a kitchen in which to cook the meals they now crave.

""We need to ... sit and have dinner together on our own, not with other people,"" he said.

Alves says the family has been fortunate in that they belong to a strong Portuguese community and are active members of their church. They do not need to eat out but are instead hosted most evenings by close friends in the area.

But life is still far from what anyone would desire.

""It's not the same thing to have our own family dinners and talk about small things that are important for life,"" he said.

Miguel and Fatima Alves' home for the past two weeks has been a hotel room.

It's clear the Alves family is very close.

Tiago has been helping with the extensive paperwork needed to get their lives back in order. He is on summer break from college, where he is working toward a degree in physics. Ines is also on her summer break from high school.

Alves has returned to work as a chauffeur, which he said has helped him cope by carrying on with life, retaining some normalcy. His wife Fatima, 47, has yet to return to work as a maid and instead spends her days handling the endless minutiae of living away from and securing their home.

She leaves the hotel with bags of laundry to take to friends' houses. At other times, she is swapping belongings from the hotel room with those kept with friends to prevent their hotel rooms from becoming cramped. Most of these belongings come from donations made to shelters during the first days after the fire.

Fatima Alves says she uses her rosary beads three times a day.

""I have so many things to do: sorting out clothes, toiletries ... and going to meetings,"" Fatima Alves said.

For her, religion and friends have been key in helping with the events of the past few weeks. Rosary beads, which she uses three times a day, sit by the bed in her hotel room.

Research has found strong evidence linking religion to better mental health, not due to any specific kind of belief but instead the mere existence of it -- something giving people hope, support and perhaps even fuel to live a healthier lifestyle.

Miguel Alves and his wife, Fatima, sing in the choir of their Portuguese community church.

Since the fire, neither parent has been sleeping well, averaging just four hours most nights.

""When I close my eyes, I can see the people waving on the windows,"" she said. ""This is my trauma. Not seeing my flat burning. ... The worst part was people begging for help ... and we couldn't do anything.""

Alves experiences the same vivid recall and wakes up anxious most nights. ""It's difficult to see those types of images,"" he said.

But once his eyes are open and the day begins, his priority is moving forward and doing whatever it takes to give his family a home, a life.

""The most important thing is to move on and put all that behind our back,"" Alves said, explaining that he will be able to process the shock once his family's lives are back in some form of order. ""This is something I never will forget.""

Psychological first aid

When, like the Alveses, a family is left with only the most meager belongings, there is no way to predict how they will deal with the sudden change in situation.

""No two people respond the same. ... There isn't a single answer,"" said Sir Simon Wessely, immediate past president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and professor of psychiatry at Kings College London. ""People often have strength and depths in these events.""

For Alves, humor has always been a lifeline, helping him stay positive whatever the situation. Jokes are frequent as he describes his life now. ""A sense of humor helps me to carry on. ... It's something for myself to cope.""

The Royal College of Psychiatrists has led a range of research on how best to respond and offer mental support to people who have gone through extreme events, such as the 2005 London bombings.

Wessely explained that there is a general order of interventions that response teams should follow: checking and confirming that people are safe; aiding communication between those affected by the incident, such as by providing mobile phones; and finally, practical and emotional support, to get them home or to a safe place, to retrieve some belongings or simply to offer frequent hugs and cups of tea.

People arrive with trays of food for people evacuated from their properties, close to Grenfell Tower, on June 14.

Some experts include these common-sense measures as part of the ""psychological first aid"" deployed after disasters, which aims to help people manage the immediate stress and hopefully prevent post-traumatic stress disorder down the line.

Doing any more, experts say, may not be worth it.

""The vast majority of people in any such disaster do fine; that's the good news,"" said Dr. Robert Ursano, chairman of the American Psychiatric Association's Committee on Psychiatric Dimensions of Disasters. ""The problem is, you have to intervene with so many people in order to prevent one or two cases.""

Wessely adds that intervening too early can also be harmful.

""If (psychiatrists) get involved too early, that is not just useless but counterproductive,"" he said. ""(They) do more harm than good. ... You're getting in the way of natural coping mechanisms.""

Some studies have showed that providing formal psychiatric treatment too early can actually increase the risk of developing PTSD, while others have shown no effect. Both outcomes suggest that resources may better be used elsewhere.

The Alveses are experiencing the horrors of the fire in their sleep -- not of their own loss but of others losing their lives and begging at their windows for help. If they are forced to recall these images and talk about them too early, the impact can be detrimental rather than helpful, experts say.

Clothes are offered to those affected by the fire that ripped through Grenfell Tower, a residential block in west London on June 14.

By eight to 18 weeks, professional support is typically necessary in only 20% to 25% of people, Wessely said. However, he adds that the anger and bitterness associated with the Grenfell fire, and that it could have been avoided, could lead to greater numbers needing more long-term help to recover.

The fire is suspected to have been stoked by the building's flammable exterior cladding , which was used to cut costs during a recent refurbishment of the building.

""They will have more prolonged grief and complications,"" he said.

People are more likely to need professional support if they have a history of mental health problems, if they live in isolation and therefore lack social support, if they're left feeling bitter or angry -- as is the case with Grenfell -- and if they are feeling guilty that they didn't help or save someone when they could have, according to Wessely.

For those who do suffer prolonged trauma, it's crucial that someone notice and make treatment available, Ursano added.

""There's substantial numbers of people that have problems that can extend over a long period of time,"" he said. ""PTSD can become chronic and enduring.""

Lessons from past survivors

Going back to a routine is one way to normalize after a major traumatic event and help people regain the lives they have lost, particularly in children, Ursano said.

This is what the Alves family has done, despite living out of a suitcase. Tiago is about to start an internship, and Ines makes sure to see friends over her school break.

Previous disasters in which people have lost everything carry the stories of millions who have been there before and managed to make it through.

But they all began with a moment of limbo.

""You wake up in the morning ... and it takes about 15 or 20 seconds, and then ... this sort of pall of depression reclaims you because you realize, oh, yeah, all my stuff is gone,"" Blake Bailey, a writer and survivor of Hurricane Katrina, said in a 2009 interview with NPR

Blake Bailey's home, sealed up after Hurricane Katrina.

In 2005, Katrina struck five Southern states, killing more than 1,800 and leaving thousands more homeless.

Bailey, now 54, and his wife and daughter packed up a few clothes and a laptop. ""But everything else was gone,"" he told CNN. He used to live with his family in New Orleans, having relocated there just two months before the storm, but now lives in Virginia.

The damage left him in debt, fighting with home finance companies for years after. He had lost his home, his stability and his memories, such as photo albums from his wedding.

""You don't have the same morbid attachment to your things ever again,"" he said.

Ursano agrees: ""We have a whole picture of the world of grief, but it's usually around people. And we don't talk often about the question of the loss of significant items that anchor us to our life.""

For Bailey, his salvation was that he had a major project to focus on: a biography of American writer John Cheever , which he published in 2009.

""I really dug in and used every spare second I had to work on that (book),"" he said.

Disasters bring some victims closer together as a family -- and a community.

""My kids were devastated during that time. ... I just focused on how to handle the trauma that they had,"" said Kitchie Ortega, a customer services representative in Manila, Philippines, who survived Typhoon Ondoy, also known as tropical storm Ketsana, in 2009. She added that her family became closer after the storm, as did her entire neighborhood.

Her home was destroyed in the typhoon, which killed more than 400 people and caused more than 70,000 people to be evacuated from their homes, according to the National Disaster Coordinating Council in the Philippines.

Houses destroyed by flooding brought by typhoon Ketsana, also known as tropical storm Ondoy, in Marikina City, Philippines in 2009.

""Any time, anyone can leave you,"" Ortega said. ""I made sure that I support everything that they do after that incident, because I don't want to regret anything.""

Ursano explained that traumatic events can change lives for the better, an outcome known as ""post-traumatic growth.""

This could eventually be the case for the Alves family. Although Tiago and Miguel bicker more over all the paperwork, the son has also seen a nervous side to his father -- a side he wants to help.

A family united

""We're stronger than ever before,"" Tiago Alves said. ""The tragedy has helped us be more united.""

His father agrees and hopes that once their shock subsides and they begin registering what has happened to them, they will have more security regarding their future.

Friends have hosted the Alves family for meals most evenings.

""Before, we looked at life as whole. ... Now, it's one day after the other,"" said Alves, who just wants the uncertainty surrounding his life to be over.

""Now, what we want is just a new house and to carry on our lives without being anxious of the future,"" he said. ""It's important to put everything behind us and carry on with our lives.""

But Wessely warns that experts will need to reach out to the family in a few months, just to ensure that they are OK and coping with reality.

There is ""potential risk of psychiatric disorder,"" he said. ""Putting everything behind you is not always the best in the long term."""

The views expressed in this commentary are her own.

(CNN) After more than two hours of talks on Friday, Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin appeared to have made progress in bridging some of the issues dividing their countries. But it's far too soon to declare success in ending the hostility that has marked recent US-Russia relations.

President Trump exceeded expectations at the meeting, principally by bringing up the issue of Russia's interference in the US elections. Just 24 hours earlier, Trump mused that ""Nobody really knows for sure"" who was responsible for hacking the elections. The Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, reportedly told Russian media that Putin denied interfering and Trump accepted his denial. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had a sharply different version of the conversation, saying the two countries could not come to an agreement on the issue.

The leaders reached agreement on other major matters, including a partial ceasefire in southwest Syria, which is a positive sign, but similar efforts have fizzled out in the past, so we should hope for the best but reserve judgment. They discussed Ukraine, the subject of sharpest disagreement, along with other key issues.

For Putin, the meeting was an even greater success. Above almost anything else, Putin wants to be seen as a major player on the global stage, and he achieved that in spades, beginning with the photo-op during which President Trump publicly declared it an ""honor"" to meet the Russian president (a man described by Defense Secretary James Mattis as a ""threat to the global order,"" and whose interference in the US elections has been described by some members of Congress as an ""act of war."")

But even before today's meeting, Putin had reason for satisfaction. While the United States has not lifted sanctions against Russia, one of the Russian President's top priorities, Putin can take great pleasure in watching what has happened to the West since Donald Trump became President.

The Western alliance is deeply divided -- and therefore weakened. The United States and its European friends no longer see eye-to-eye on key issues. The Trump administration has vowed to mostly set aside issues such as human rights and democracy promotion in foreign policy.

And, despite President Trump's belated support for NATO's mutual defense commitment, America's allies are less sure than ever before about the depth of Washington's commitment to the European Union and its efforts to strengthen democracy.

As with other campaign promises and foreign policy ideas, Donald Trump has discovered that improving relations with Russia is easier said than done -- so long as you also remain committed to safe-guarding US interests.

Perhaps some in his campaign rallies thought the notion of re-engaging with Russia was a novel concept. It isn't. Every US president since the end of the Cold War has tried it. And even during Soviet times, US leaders saw the benefit of working together in areas of common interest.

Franklin D. Roosevelt clenched his jaw and joined with Joseph Stalin to defeat Hitler. More recently, George W. Bush famously met with Vladimir Putin in 2001, ""looked the man in the eye,"" and said he could ""get a sense of his soul.""

Later, when Putin sent Russian troops into the sovereign nation of Georgia , Bush had to re-evaluate what he had seen in Putin's soul.

The Obama administration also tried various approaches, all aimed at developing better relations. There was the infamous ""reset"" and Obama's just as-infamous hot-microphone whisper to then-Russian president Dmitry Medvedev that he would have ""more flexibility"" to work with Russia after the elections.

Ties unraveled further after Russia's heavy-handed interference in Ukraine, with the annexation of Crimea, and Russia's military intervention and support for Ukrainian separatists. That was the straw that brought down the pretense of rapprochement and triggered sanctions. The deterioration continued when Putin sent his forces to fight in Syria, on the side of President Bashar al-Assad and Iran.

JUST WATCHED Things Trump has said about Putin Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Things Trump has said about Putin 01:27

For Trump, improving relations with Russia is particularly difficult because of the dark cloud of election hacking and his continuing equivocation on the issue. Despite consensus among US intelligence agencies -- including Trump's own appointees -- that it was Russia that hacked the US election, Trump is still hedging.

Questions remain about why, exactly, Trump so consistently praises Putin and criticizes America's allies. Assuming that Trump's interest is nothing other than America's, there are very real reasons why Russia and the US so often disagree: The two countries have conflicting goals in many areas.

That became evident, early in Trump's term, when Russia's Syrian allies used chemical weapons against civilians, prompting Trump to launch missiles. The US and Russia agree on the need to defeat ISIS and return stability to Syria, but they profoundly disagree about what should come next, for reasons that go beyond Syria, including the influence of Iran and the Sunni-Shiite divide afflicting the Middle East.

US intelligence says Russia has only increased its spying activity in the United States and warns of a significant Russian threat to America's next election. For Putin, this is likely reason to grin. Even more satisfying must be the turmoil that has followed the US election, which makes democracy seem less appealing, potentially sapping some energy from demands for more democracy in Russia, where he has hollowed out of any semblance of democratic fair play.

Putin is an experienced, wily operator. Just hours before the Trump-Putin meeting, Russia blocked a US resolution on North Korea at the UN Security Council. It might have been a case of Putin flexing his muscle to show how much power he has to help or hurt the US.

The first direct meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin surprised many with the amount of substance it contained. But while Trump is just getting to know the Russian President, the United States has many years of experience with Putin. Presidents looking after US interests have found that, while there is room for cooperation on specific issues, positive early meetings often lead to disappointment later. Friday was a great day for Putin, a good one for Trump. For the rest of the world, we'll have to wait and see what actually materializes after the talks."
http://cnn.com/2017/07/04/opinions/crisis-new-abnormal-opinion-dantonio/index.html,TRUMP HAS DRAGGED AMERICA INTO A PERMANENT STATE OF CRISIS,"Michael D'Antonio is the author of the book "" Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success "" (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

(CNN) Shortly before his first Fourth of July in office, Ronald Reagan honored the NAACP by addressing its convention. Eight years later, President George H.W. Bush declared, ''The law cannot tolerate any discrimination, and my administration will not tolerate abuse of that principle.'' In 2001, his son used his first July Fourth in office to advocate ""brotherly love"" in Philadelphia. Bush's successor, Barack Obama, made news when he warned that Russia's Vladimir Putin still had ""one foot"" in the Cold War.

Flash-forward to 2017. Independence Day finds America plunged into what can only be called a crisis of the ""new abnormal."" With an investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia well underway, President Donald Trump has done little to respond to Putin's massive cyberattacks against the United States and its allies. Instead, he spends his days tweeting against his critics. It's no wonder his approval ratings have dipped below 40%

Trump's newest low has predictably involved attacks on the news media and includes a few seconds of video in which Trump punches a man with the CNN logo for a head -- possibly borrowed from an individual whoCNN reports may have an anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim track record.

Coming from a president just days before the nation's celebration of its independence, Americans have reason to be disheartened. But what makes matters worse is that his most recent tweets are just the latest in Trump's growing list of juvenile outbursts, and they are accompanied by more serious acts, which may represent an abuse of presidential power.

Attacking and undermining the media

According to MSNBC ""Morning Joe"" co-hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough, top White House aides threatened that the National Enquirer, a notorious supermarket tabloid, would publish an expose about them if they did not apologize to the President for their criticisms. The National Enquirer and the White House both dispute this claim.

Given the Enquirer's penchant for destructive and salacious gossip and the President's longtime friendship with its publisher, the calls from the White House could be considered credible threats. And threats, both veiled and direct, have long been Trump's stock-in-trade. After his abrupt firing of FBI Director James Comey, who was about to testify to Congress, Trump said Comey ""better hope there are no `tapes' of our conversations."" More recently, he reportedly threatened to sue CNN, saying, ""Wouldn't that be fun?""

Although he spent a lifetime exploiting the press to get free publicity, Trump entered politics without an appreciation for the role journalists play and with no intention of learning new ways to deal with them.

Trump is not the first president to express irritation with reporters, but his predecessors found ways to accommodate them and celebrate the First Amendment's prohibition of any law ""abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.""

Theodore Roosevelt chatted with journalists while having his morning shave. John F. Kennedy endorsed the idea of an ""abrasive"" press even though he didn't like it. Reagan considered America's ""noble experiment in self-government"" and declared, ""There is no more essential ingredient than a free, strong and independent press.""

Kennedy and Reagan often suffered from press reports that revealed their struggles and missteps, but both men were confident their own motivations and methods were essentially good and could withstand the sunlight. In contrast, even before he was elected, Trump devoted an extraordinary amount of time, energy and effort to delegitimizing the press. In retrospect, Trump's effort can be seen as a pre-emptive attempt to sow distrust of the messengers who may reveal unpleasant truths about him.

What does the current president have to hide?

His retreat from a promise to make public his tax returns suggests he doesn't want the nation to learn about the true extent of his wealth, the nature of his business alliances and sources of investments in his properties. The sudden firing of Comey, who was overseeing a probe of the Trump campaign's possible ties to Russian interference in the 2016 election, points to problems he might want to cover up -- if he has anything to hide.

Richard Nixon shared Trump's antipathy for the press. ""The press is the enemy, the press is the enemy,"" Nixon told his national security advisers Henry Kissinger and Alexander Haig in 1972 in one of many tape recordings Nixon secretly made in the Oval Office. The tapes reveal a President who was profane, conspiratorial, obsessive and afraid to be exposed -- the same qualities that led to the crimes and cover-up known as Watergate and ultimately to Nixon's resignation.

Nixon's rage at the press was fueled by his understanding that his White House had failed not only the law but the norms of the office he held. And the same is true of Trump. He, too, has thus far failed to live up to the presidency's demand for leadership that is steady, inspiring and respectful of the American people. In his relationship with the press, Trump has been worse than Nixon, repeatedly seeking to destroy its credibility in the eyes of all Americans.

In this flag-waving season, Americans tend to consider the patriotic example set by the White House. In general, presidents have shown themselves to be mature in their respect for the values enshrined in the country's founding documents, even those, such as freedom of the press, that can be a hindrance to them. Anything less represents a selective expression of faith, pseudo-patriotism in the service of self and ignorance of the noble experiment.

Thats the highest level since Bloomberg started tracking the shipments in November. All of the cargoes for this month are jet fuel.As holiday demand is picking up, Europe needs more supplies, said Ehsan Ul-Haq, an analyst at Resource Economist Ltd. in London. Because the season runs until early September, airlines have to stock up on the aviation fuel now.The surge in jet fuel shipments illustrates the change in oil flows during the summer months, when Asian refiners typically export the most jet fuel to help feed seasonal growth in world travel. A drop in shipping rates in recent months has made trade on the route from the Far East to Europe increasingly profitable, also known as opening the arbitrage.Freight rates for Aframax-class tankers, which frequently haul as much as 90,000 tons of oil on the route, have declined to between $1.3 million and $1.4 million per trip, according to tanker fixture reports compiled by Bloomberg. Two months ago, those rates were around $1.5 million per voyage.South Korea, Asias biggest jet fuel exporter, shipped a record 12.1 million barrels in July of last year, according to data from Korea National Oil Corp. The nations exports at the end of May, the latest figures available, were almost 30 percent higher than the 5-year average.So far in July, two tankers laden with Korean jet fuel -- Aframaxes Pacific A.

Xi says China will participate in next year's Rim of the Pacific military exercises

(CNN) Less than a week after a historic North Korean missile test, the leaders of the United States and China pledged to work together to stop Kim Jong Un's nuclear missile program.

""Something has to be done,"" US President Donald Trump said during the brief public portion of a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Germany.

There will ""eventually be a success"" against Pyongyang, Trump said. ""It may take longer than I'd like. It may take longer than you'd like. But there will be success in the end one way or the other.""

Xi told Trump that China remains ""firmly committed to denuclearizing the (Korean) peninsula,"" according to a report from China's state-run Xinhua news agency.

A solution on North Korea must come through dialogue and consultation involving the international community, Xi said.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-oncor-m-a-elliott-exclusive-idUSKBN19S2PP,EXCLUSIVE: ELLIOTT EXPLORES BID TO CHALLENGE BUFFETT'S ONCOR DEAL - SOURCES,"(Reuters) - Elliott Management Corp, the largest creditor of the bankrupt parent of Oncor Electric Delivery Co, is exploring putting together a bid for the Texas power transmission company that would top Warren Buffett's $9 billion all-cash deal, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. If Elliott, the hedge fund run by billionaire Paul Singer, proceeds with such a bid, it would be a rare challenge to Buffett, who avoids auctions for companies and has told his investors he does not like to participate in bidding wars. Elliott would seek to convert its debt in the company to equity, as well as raise new equity financing for its bid, the sources said. As with Buffett's deal, a bankruptcy judge would have to approve Elliott's alternative plan. Elliott's stance illustrates the complexities of acquiring companies whose debt is trading at distressed levels. SoftBank Group Corp Chief Executive Masayoshi Son, another famed dealmaker, saw the $14 billion merger between the Japanese company's satellite startup OneWeb and debt-laden peer Intelsat SA collapse last month after many of the latter's creditors refused to back the deal.  The hedge fund believes it can put together a higher offer than the deal announced on Friday by Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, which has a total value of $18.1 billion including debt, the people said. In May, Elliott held about $2.9 billion of Oncor parent Energy Future Holdings' roughly $10 billion debt load, with its investment concentrated in a layer of unsecured payment-in-kind notes trading at deeply distressed levels. The hedge fund amassed its position in Energy Future's debt from October to May, according to court papers.  Elliott is considering pursuing an alternate deal for Energy Future because it thinks Berkshire's offer undervalues the Oncor business, seen as the bankrupt company's crown jewel asset, the people said. Elliott may also seek to use its rights as a creditor to Energy Future to block the sale of the company to Berkshire in bankruptcy court, according to the sources.  The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Elliott declined to comment, while Oncor and Berkshire Hathaway did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Berkshire's pursuit of Energy Future comes after two other suitors, most recently NextEra Energy, failed to win approval from regulators. The unsecured payment-in-kind notes Elliott holds fell in value by close to 30 percent in secondary trading on Friday on news of the Berkshire deal, to about 29.5 cents on the dollar, according to Thomson Reuters data, indicating investor concerns over these notes' recovery prospects. When NextEra clinched a deal last year to buy Energy Future and Oncor in a deal worth $18.4 billion, including debt, Berkshire also submitted a bid at the time, the sources said. Berkshire's bid then valued Energy Future at more than its deal on Friday does, the sources added.  Elliott has developed a reputation on Wall Street as an aggressive debt investor, having engaged in a fierce battle with Argentina over its sovereign debt that spanned more than a decade.  Elliott filed a lawsuit in May against Energy Future asking for it to consider debt reorganization alternatives, including a plan that would involve converting Elliott's significant debt holdings in the company to equity, eventually putting Oncor under the hedge fund's control.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-consumers-arbitration-idUSKBN19V28C,NEW RULE REQUIRES U.S. BANKS TO ALLOW CONSUMER CLASS ACTIONS,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. banks and credit card companies could be prevented from blocking customers from banding together to sue them under a rule released by the country's consumer finance agency on Monday. In releasing the rule, which goes into full effect in eight months, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fired the first shot in a likely brutal political battle between Republicans and Democrats over regulators' reach into banks' workings and customer rights. Banks blasted the rule, which bars financial firms from forcing customers to agree to settle disputes only through arbitration as a condition of opening new accounts, but consumer advocates said it will make sure wronged customers have their day in court. ""Mandatory arbitration"" clauses that block customers from filing or joining a class-action lawsuit appear in contracts for a wide variety of products. The rule was proposed last year under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat who appointed the current director of the CFPB, Richard Cordray. Republicans now control both Congress and the White House, and are already looking into stopping it in its tracks. Just before the CFPB unveiled the final rule, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika wrote Cordray to raise ""safety and soundness"" concerns with a draft version he had read and asked the CFPB to share data it used in crafting the rule, according to a copy of the letter obtained by Reuters.  The CFPB did not share the final rule with him ahead of the announcement, according to an Office of the Comptroller of the Currency spokesman. In the letter, Noreika, appointed by Republican President Donald Trump, cited a section of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that allows his office to set aside possibly unsafe CFPB rules. Eliminating mandatory arbitration ""could result in less effective consumer protection and remedies, while simply enriching class-action lawyers,"" he wrote, adding the rule ""may potentially decrease the products and services offered to consumers, while increasing their costs."" In the final rule, the bureau requires financial companies to give customers the option of arbitration or of banding together to sue in class actions. Companies must also provide redacted records of claims and awards reached through arbitration, which the CFPB will post on its website beginning in July 2019. Rule critics say class actions are costly, suck up time and result in lower awards for consumers. In recent months, they have worked to undo regulations barring the fine print from contracts for nursing-homes and for-profit colleges. Supporters say Americans have the right to take complaints to court, and group lawsuits are effective in publicly correcting bad corporate behavior. They say arbitrations are secretive and rigged in favor of companies. California may soon allow state residents to sue financial institutions after clauses inserted into Wells Fargo account-opening agreements blocked customers from suing over the bank's creation of unauthorized accounts in their names. Calling the new CFPB rule ""anti-consumer,"" the Republican chair of the House Financial Services Committee, Representative Jeb Hensarling said Congress should reject it under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), which gives lawmakers power to kill newly minted regulations. The Consumer Bankers Association has already begun lobbying lawmakers to use the CRA on the rule, said its president Richard Hunt.  Cordray, too, told reporters on a call he expects Congress to look into nullifying the rule but questioned the level of support for the move. Congress has already banned mandatory arbitration clauses for mortgages and contracts involving members of the military, he said.     Meanwhile, one of Washington's most powerful lobby groups and CFPB critics, the Chamber of Commerce, said it will ""consider every approach to address our concerns,"" which many interpreted as a threat to sue.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/10/politics/voting-panel-trump-tweets/index.html,LAWSUITS CITE TRUMP TWEETS TO CHALLENGE VOTING PANEL,"Washington (CNN) Opponents of President Donald Trump's voting integrity commission are seeking to hamstring the effort in court, filing three lawsuits Monday that say the panel is running afoul of federal laws -- and introducing Trump's heated rhetoric against him in court.

The new lawsuits add to the legal challenges against the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, which recently sent a letter to all 50 states that included a request for voter roll information, including parts of Social Security numbers, that alarmed states and voters. The letter asked for all ""publicly available"" data, but the long list of pieces of information sought, including the last four digits of Social Security numbers, included several elements that very few states, if any, say they can legally comply with.

One lawsuit targets on the request for voter information as a violation of privacy, while the other two focus more generally on whether the commission has been violating government transparency laws.

Just as with the lawsuits against Trump's travel bans, the challengers are using Trump's own words and tweets to fight his administration's actions, saying the commission was created to back up a spurious theory in the first place -- that voter fraud is a massive problem in the US.

""President Trump has a long history of propagating baseless conspiracy theories about voter fraud, ostensibly in order to suppress the right to vote,"" states a lawsuit from the ACLU of Florida and voters filed in a Florida federal court.

The lawsuits join an ongoing privacy case filed by advocates that sought to stop the commission's effort to collect information on voters all across America.

That litigation has prompted the office of Vice President Mike Pence -- who chairs the commission -- to email secretaries of state on Monday asking them to hold off transmitting any voter data pending the resolution of that case, according to a copy of the email obtained by CNN.

The White House is also changing its plans for how to house the information in response to the complaint, according to a new court filing submitted Monday.

Pence's office did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuits.

Using Trump's campaign speeches, tweets against him

While technical challenges to the law hinge on obscure federal codes like the Federal Advisory Committee Act and E-Government Act, the Florida complaint dedicates an entire section to Trump's repeated statements about rampant voter fraud -- statements that have been repeatedly debunked.

The lawsuit seeks to ""prevent the unauthorized collection of state voter information data"" and to prohibit the Florida secretary of state from providing the information. Lawyers for the ACLU argue that it infringes on voters' First Amendment rights and constitutes and ""unjustified invasion"" of privacy in violation of federal law.

The complaint cites a string of comments from Trump as a candidate and as President.

On October 17, 2016, lawyers cite Trump as saying: ""They say there's nothing going on. People that have died 10 years ago are still voting. Illegal immigrants are voting. I mean, where are the street smarts of some of these politicians? ... So many cities are corrupt, and voter fraud is very, very common.""

And after the election, on November 27, 2016, Trump said, ""In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.""

He later tweeted , ""I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and....even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!""

The White House has never offered evidence that illegal votes were cast in 2016 -- instead creating the commission and pointing to studies that found general irregularities on voting rolls. Studies have repeatedly shown that voter fraud is exceedingly rare in the US, tending to be isolated cases and usually mistakes.

The commission has a handful of Democratic members, some of whom have said they hope the group will also look at interference in the election by Russia.

Violating transparency rules?

The national ACLU on Monday also filed a lawsuit alleging the commission violated federal transparency laws by holding an organizing call that was not public, after which Kobach sent the controversial letter.

The commission provided a read-out of that call from the vice president's office, and have a meeting scheduled July 19 that will be livestreamed for the public. But the ACLU, which has been critical of the White House on the issue, says that's not enough.

""The commission held its first meeting without notice or making it open to the public,"" said ACLU staff attorney Theresa Lee. ""This process is cloaked in secrecy, raising serious concerns about its credibility and intent. What are they trying to hide?""

A similar lawsuit was also filed Monday by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Both lawsuits, filed in Washington, DC, district court, argue the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which mandates levels of transparency for federal commissions, require more of the voting integrity group.

The new lawsuits Monday join a filing from the Electronic Privacy Information Center challenging the collection of voters' information and another from Lawyers' Committee arguing Kobach may have violated the Hatch Act by promoting his role in the commission in his gubernatorial campaign.

""These lawsuits shows how voting rights advocates are looking for creative legal arguments to undermine the commission's activities,"" said Josh A. Douglas, an election law expert at the University of Kentucky College of Law. ""It's remarkable considering that prior election law commissions, which were seen as truly bipartisan, never faced this kind of challenge to its authority or actions."""
http://cnn.com/2017/07/05/opinions/liberals-free-speech-and-trump-stanley/index.html,STANLEY: IS TRUMP AN ENEMY OF FREE SPEECH OR MERELY EXERCISING IT IN A WAY THAT LIBERALS DISLIKE?,"Timothy Stanley, a conservative, is a historian and columnist for Britain's Daily Telegraph. He is the author of "" Citizen Hollywood: How the Collaboration Between LA and DC Revolutionized American Politics ."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

(CNN) Slowly, tweet by tweet, we are building an etiquette of online behavior. The rule is: be as nasty as you like, but there may well be consequences. The exception seems to be Donald Trump, who sometimes seems like he is on a one-man mission to test the limits of free speech.

Last week, President Trump tweeted a video of himself wrestling a man to the floor, the man's head digitally replaced with the CNN logo. CNN tracked down the Reddit user who created the video, and also asked him about other posts of his that consisted of racist, Islamophobic, and anti-Semitic language and imagery . HanA**holeSolo, as the user is known, apologized profusely, insisted that he loves ""people of all races, creeds and origins,"" and insisted that the video wasn't intended to incite violence against the media.

The President, on the other hand, did not say ""sorry."" He tweeted : ""My use of social media is not Presidential - it's MODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL. Make America Great Again!""

Parties on each side of this saga could legitimately say they're taking a stand for free speech. CNN is defending the freedom of the press against a President who has sometimes appeared to threaten it. Conservatives charge CNN with being thin-skinned , but I've reported on Trump rallies where the audience has been moved to send up a chant of ""CNN sucks,"" and where the anger at the so-called mainstream media nearly boiled over into outright intimidation. When the President of a democracy tweets a video of himself beating up a media organization, isn't that an implicit threat against the free press?

No, say Trump's supporters, it's just a funny video of a President gone wild. They say it's at least as beyond the pale to chase down the creator of this tawdry video as it is to tweet it in the first place.

HanA**holeSolo's creation is classic Trumpery: it shows the President figuratively wrestling the media to the ground, yes, but with a dash of self-aware humor that the left is oddly tone-deaf to.

Does Trump really think he has the physique of a pro wrestler? Or that his tweets are witty ripostes worthy of Downton Abbey? No. He's a troll on a cosmic scale, and sometimes liberals would do well to ignore the one-liners he bashes out on his phone and focus on what he's doing in his day job.

As Naomi Klein argues in her new book, distraction changes the subject . Every time Trump is in trouble, he shifts our attention by tweeting something outrageous. The media, far from stopping his nonsense, might actually be giving it oxygen.

So, which is it? Is the President an enemy of free speech or merely exercising it in a way that liberals dislike? Personal experience has taught me that the line between these two things is vanishingly thin.

Down the years, I've had it all thrown at me: anti-Semitism, accusations of being a racist, homophobia, accusations of homophobia, cartoons of me in a gas oven, etc. I've said some bad things myself -- never that bad, I want to emphasize -- and feel guilty for having contributed my own small portion to this moral mudslide.

But if I might pretend to be completely innocent for a moment, then I have a couple of observations to make. One is that women always get it worst. Another is that people are happy to turn a blind eye to abuse when they agree with it politically. Liberals can give offense but they never take it lightly.

A third is that the cost of being bad online is rising. Reputations can be ruined by a nasty tweet, or even a tweet that just wasn't well phrased or was unfairly misinterpreted. Generosity is dying; it's rare to be given the benefit of the doubt. Social media is starting to become a strange mix of the abrasive and the censorious, of which the CNN wrestling story is a rather good illustration.

My sympathy, however, does lie with CNN -- for one simple reason. Online abuse is killing the appeal of public service. Any sane, ethical young person would see the ugliness of modern politics and journalism and conclude they want no part of public life. The President is encouraging that.

Horrible things have been said about Trump, true. He could argue that he's simply fighting back, yes. But fighting fire with fire inevitably leads to more fire, and while I'm sympathetic towards some of Trump's agenda, I look upon the state of politics in this era with despair. It is not unreasonable for journalists to say ""enough is enough."""

Underwhelming quarterly sales released Monday showed a plateau in demand for the high-priced Model S and Model X vehicles ahead of the debut of Teslas cheaper sedan. When paired with Volvo Car Groups vow to electrify its lineup in the coming years, investors demonstrated their concern both about execution and competitive risk.Tesla still faces a lot of challenges, said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at Autotrader. Tesla needs to focus on quality over speed as they ramp up the Model 3. The Volvo announcement drove home the fact that Tesla is going to face more competition. Tesla is no longer going to own electric vehicle territory exclusively, and traditional automakers really know how to crank out the cars.The Model 3 is the linchpin to Musks growth ambitions. Becoming more of a mass-market carmaker will require overcoming the routine manufacturing issues that have handicapped output of the Model X at a time when American consumers are hungry for sport utility vehicles. So-called legacy automakers also wont go down without a fight -- Volvo this week said itll have five electric models in its lineup by 2021 and that all of its new models will have hybrid or fully electric powertrains from 2019.Teslas 12 percent drop over the last two days has cost the company its position as the biggest U.S. automaker by stock-market capitalization. Its value has slipped to $50.74 billion, about $1.9 billion behind General Motors Co."
http://cnn.com/2017/07/07/opinions/trump-voter-commission-opinion-stewart/index.html,TRUMP'S VOTER COMMISSION SAFEGUARDS OUR RIGHTS,"Alice Stewart is a CNN political commentator and former communications director for Ted Cruz for President. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) Despite his own reservations about Russian meddling in the 2016 election, President Donald Trump defied critics and pressed Russian President Vladimir Putin on the issue during their private meeting in Germany. Not surprisingly, Putin denied any meddling . Their 2-hour meeting may have ended, but the Russia probe is far from over.

As with all things political, election irregularities are viewed through a number of partisan lenses: Democrats point to voter suppression , Republicans claim voter fraud , and many focus on Russian interference in our election process. The reality is, none of these are mutually exclusive. The only way to put all those fears to rest is to fully investigate the 2016 election and work to restore integrity to the process and encourage voter participation.

President Trump's Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity is taking steps to uncover voting irregularities and make necessary changes. The bipartisan commission aims to review election issues in places like Russia, Ohio, while also shedding light on possible Russian meddling

The FBI, CIA and National Security Agency have concluded Russia meddled in the 2016 election, and the panel's review of voting networks across the country would provide valuable insight on outside interference.

Having worked as Deputy Secretary of State in Arkansas, I know the awesome responsibility shared by each state's designated chief election official , and overseeing elections according to law. Their role is to ensure the integrity of the voting process.

The Election Commission's initial step in studying the registration and voting processes was to seek data from Secretaries of State across the country. Vice Chairman and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, requested that each state provide ""publicly available voter roll data"" as allowed under each state's laws. While protecting state-level authority in our federalist system is important, assisting federal authorities in their efforts to bring about free and fair elections is paramount.

Commission Chair Vice President Mike Pence says the goal is to preserve the principle of one person, one vote ; a clean, verifiable voter database is a critical part of that process.

As of now, the Vice President's office reports that 36 states are providing the data or reviewing what data they can provide. The other 14 states, mostly led by Democratic election officials, are refusing to comply with the request, citing privacy concerns. The problem with that is, the requested information is available to the public already. Anyone, at virtually anytime, can obtain this data.

To quote Hillary Clinton's 2015 speech on voting rights , ""What part of democracy are they afraid of?""

Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez calls it a ""Trump propaganda factory."" He encouraged election officials not to provide the information that would help in the effort to restore election integrity. The obvious question is: What do Democrats have to hide?

It could be the news that a Virginia student pleaded guilty last week to registering dead people for Democrats . Maybe it's the story of 12 people in Indiana connected with a Democratic group last month charged with submitting falsified voter registration applications.

Democrats say the commission is a large-scale effort aimed at voter suppression. I don't buy that; no one deprives an American citizen of the right to vote except the person himself.

Americans are blessed with the freedom to vote. As Thomas Paine said : ""Those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom, must, like men, undergo the fatigues of supporting it."" That goes for identifying election problems and correcting them.

Choosing not to help uncover irregularities is not a stand on principle or a form of rebellion; it's surrender. Surrendering is more of the same. If we don't learn from history, we're doomed to repeat it. It's time to vote like your right to vote depends on it."

Stocks were volatile on Wall Street, with defensive sectors emerging as the best performers as the S&P 500 eked out a small gain. A massive trade in gold futures as Europe opened for trading dragged the contract to a six-week low. European shares rose the most in five sessions as banks rallied after Italy reached a deal to wind up two failed regional lenders. Nestle (NESN.S) jumped 4.3 percent, the most in almost six years, after an activist investor urged changes at the world's largest food company. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.41 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.13 percent. Bank stocks .SX7P rose after an agreement in which Italy's largest retail bank, Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI), will take on the remaining good assets of collapsed Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca. But across the Atlantic, new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in May and shipments also declined, suggesting a loss of momentum in the manufacturing sector halfway through the second quarter. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 14.79 points, or 0.07 percent, to 21,409.55, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.77 points, or 0.03 percent, to 2,439.07 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 18.10 points, or 0.29 percent, to 6,247.15. Emerging market stocks rose 0.81 percent. The best performing sectors on the S&P 500 were telecoms and utilities, so-called bond proxies because of their relative higher yield and lower volatility. ""The bond market is signaling an economic slowing,"" said  Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago, pointing to a flatter yield curve. ""That's why you're seeing defensive names (in stocks) like utilities do well because equity investors are buying more in line with what that bond market is saying."" Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields fell after the soft new capital goods orders data. The yield curve has flattened in the past month as Federal Reserve speakers including New York Fed President William Dudley have indicated further monetary policy tightening is likely even as economic data disappoints. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 3/32 in price to yield 2.1352 percent, from 2.144 percent late on Friday. The yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds US5US30=TWEB fell to 93.1 basis points, the flattest since late 2007. It was last at 93.9 basis points. The U.S. dollar fell against the euro after the weaker-than-expected data, but buyers came in support of the greenback after it hit a more than one-week low. The dollar index .DXY rose 0.17 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.11 percent to $1.118. The Japanese yen weakened 0.54 percent versus the greenback at 111.87 per dollar, while sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.2717, up 0.01 percent. U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 0.93 percent to $43.41 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $45.90, up 0.79 percent on the day. U.S. oil is still set for a near 20 percent drop in the first half of the year. Investors in U.S. crude futures and options increased their bets against any further rise in prices, as the number of U.S. oil rigs in operation hit its highest in over three years.  U.S. production could jump to 10, maybe 10.5 million barrels a day by the end of the year, and when you add Libya, Nigeria and North Sea production that will negate the Saudi-led cuts,"" said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. U.S. output has steadily grown to around 9.35 million barrels per day. The rise in supplies threatens efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners to reduce global oil inventories with production cuts. Gold tumbled to its lowest price in nearly six weeks as a large sell order hit sentiment on Monday, though losses were limited by political uncertainty around the world. The sale of 1.85 million ounces of gold and 5,000 ounces of silver in a short time was behind the fall in prices, said Afshin Nabavi, head of trading at MKS in Switzerland.

Countries like China will also have to be more transparent about how they subsidize domestic producers. In return, the U.S. agreed to boilerplate language reiterating the G-20s commitment to fight protectionism.The threat of a trade war on steel hung over this weeks G-20 summit in Hamburg and those fears were compounded Friday when German Chancellor Angela Merkel said negotiations were proving to be difficult. That said, the statement still preserves Trumps ability to impose harsh new steel tariffs if he determines they are warranted.The U.S. is a net importer of steel used for construction, infrastructure and other demands. But President Donald Trump promised during his election campaign to help revive the steel industry and said the U.S. cant take chances by relying on imports of the metal for reasons of national and economic security.In a key passage, the G-20 communique urges world leaders to urgently seek the removal of market-distorting subsidies and other types of support by governments and related entities, according to a copy provided to Bloomberg. That was significantly stronger than the language adopted by the G-20 at last years summit in Hangzhou, China.The joint statement further calls on G-20 members to fulfill their commitments on enhancing information sharing and cooperation by August 2017, and to rapidly develop concrete policy solutions that reduce steel excess capacity.The data and proposed policy solutions will then be compiled into a report and published by the OECDs Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity in November, according to the leaked communique text.G-20 members will take stock of their progress during Argentinas 2018 G-20 summit in Buenos Aires, the text said.The text represents a blow to President Xi Jinping, who has resisted Washingtons efforts to squarely blame his government for the excess capacity and depressed prices for steel products.Despite Chinas commitment to reduce the countrys annual steel capacity by as much as 150 million tons before 2020, U.S. and European regulators argue that Beijing has not done enough to curb its government subsidies for steel and other products.The Trump administration ultimately endorsed language to fight protectionist measures and ensure reciprocity in trade and investment frameworks. Its noteworthy that U.S. officials opposed such language at the G-20 finance ministers meeting in March  less than a month before Trump launched investigations to determine whether cheap international imports of steel pose a threat to U.S. national security.In addition, the July 8 communique text recognized the right of members to apply legitimate trade defense instruments to address unfair trade practices  something that preserves Trumps ability to impose tariffs in future.The text comes as Brussels mulls new trade defense instruments to permit higher anti-dumping duties on exports from countries where there are significant distortions to free market forces.The European Union got everything we wanted, an EU official said. We were very successful in what we wanted to obtain.The share prices of the biggest domestic steelmakers, including Nucor Corp., United States Steel Corp. and Steel Dynamics Inc., surged after Trumps election on expectations that the president would implement policies to reduce the amount of foreign metal coming into the country. The U.S. benchmark price for steel rose 55 percent last year, its biggest gain in at least a decade, after a slate of successful trade cases levied anti-dumping and countervailing duties against countries including China.When a U.S. probe was launched in April, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross argued that China had failed to deliver on promises to reduce excess steel capacity, a situation that he said was hurting the U.S. industry. China has noted that its shipments to the U.S. are low-end steel products that local producers arent willing to make.Ross originally planned to submit findings from the investigation in June, but missed the self-imposed deadline amid news reports that the administration was debating what level of tariffs to impose. Trump considered slapping 20 percent duties on steel, before deciding to soften his approach, online publication Axios reported early this month, citing unnamed administration officials."
http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/07/entertainment/kesha-praying/index.html,KESHA'S FRESH START,"(CNN) Is Kesha's new song going to be the fresh start she's been praying for?

Time will tell. But the singer is certainly hoping that's the case.

""I haven't slept in, like, I don't know how many days because I'm so excited and nervous,"" she said in an interview with The Zack Sang Show on Friday. ""I just feel like I'm on another planet.""

Kesha released ballad ""Praying"" on Thursday, her first new song in almost four years.

""Basically, there was a point where I didn't know if I was ever going to get to put out music again,"" she said, saying she's been crying ""happy tears"" for days. ""And here we are.""

The singer has been tied up in a long back-and-forth legal battle with producer Dr. Luke (real name Lukasz Gottwald), stemming from 2014 allegations that he drugged, emotionally abused and sexually assaulted her.

Gottwald has long denied those claims.

The legal proceedings for some time kept Kesha's career in a holding pattern.

Kesha's last album was 2012's ""Warrior.""

In fall 2015, Kesha and her attorney, Mark Geragos, attempted to secure a judge's permission to allow the singer to record with other labels and producers, stating in their petition that Kesha's career threatened to ""suffer irreparable harm"" due to her lack of new material. The move prompted the #FreeKesha movement on social media, with fans and advocates calling for the singer's release from her existing contract with Dr. Luke and his Kemosabe Records.

The effort failed, and Gottwald's lawyers asserted that the courts had already ""found that Kesha is already 'free' to record and release music without working with Dr. Luke as a producer if she doesn't want to,"" according to a statement at the time.

""Praying"" and the album from which it comes, ""Rainbow,"" are the first pieces of new material from Kesha since the legal dispute began.

""Rainbow"" is being released on Kemosabe Records/RCA Records.

Gottwald, who is no longer CEO of Kemosabe , is said to have had approval on the album, according to Gottwald's lawyer.

""There was no change in Kesha's contractual recording obligations -- she has not succeeded on any legal claim or motion to avoid them,"" attorney Christine Lepera told CNN in a statement Friday. ""Instead, she was always free to record and refused to. Now, as legally required all along, the album was released with Dr. Luke's approval by Kemosabe, which is a joint venture label of Dr. Luke and Sony.""

Dr. Luke has an ongoing defamation and breach of contract claim against Kesha in New York that Lepera said ""will be prosecuted fully.""

""Praying"" was produced and co-written by Ryan Lewis, of hip-hop duo Macklemore & Ryan Lewis.

Kesha, meanwhile, maintains that her single is a song into which she has ""channeled my feelings of severe hopelessness and depression.""

""It's from our darkest moments that we gain the most strength,"" she wrote in a published essay . ""There were so many days, months even, when I didn't want to get out of bed....I was never at peace, night or day. But I dragged myself out of bed and took my emotions to the studio and made art out of them.""

""Rainbow"" will be released on August 11."

http://cnn.com/travel/article/okinoshima-japan-unesco-men-only-island/index.html,"WELCOME TO OKINOSHIMA, THE WORLD HERITAGE SITE BANNED TO WOMEN - CNN.COM","Anish Gawande, CNN Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Updated 10th July 2017

(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Only men can put the mystical Okinoshima on their UNESCO World Heritage Sites must-see list.

The sacred Japanese island, among several added in 2017 to the prestigious list of monuments with historical significance, is prohibited to women.

Steeped in the traditions of Japan's ancient Shinto belief system, Okinoshima has been revered by Japanese seafarers since the fourth century CE.

Tens of thousands of artifacts from across the world, kept on the island as ritual offerings over centuries, are evidence of the rich cultural heritage of the region.

Okinoshima is worshipped for its kami -- or divine being -- and access is ordinarily prohibited to all except Shinto priests.

Strict Taboos

Men can only enter Okinoshima island after purifying themselves with sea water.

Women are prohibited from visiting because of ancient taboos, that also prohibit the eating of four-legged animals and prevent anyone from leaving the island without priestly permission.

Only 200 men can visit the island once a year, on May 27 for a grand festival -- and only after a process of misogi ablution that involves bathing naked for ritual purification.

You cannot speak a word of what you see or hear in Okinoshima to the outside world and cannot carry anything -- including a mere blade of grass -- back with you. In fact, fishermen from the region refrain from taking even a pine branch floating in the water around the island.

Why women cannot visit the island remains unclear.

Speculation about the tradition's origin ranges from a Shinto belief in the impurity of menstrual blood to a concern for the safety of women in dangerous waters.

Priceless artifacts

A Shinto priest holds a ritural ceremony at Okitsugu shrine of the Munakata Taisha in Okinoshima island.

More than 80,000 artifacts have been unearthed in Okinoshima, including comma-shaped beads, shards of Persian glass, and gold rings. Declared collectively as national treasures of Japan, these are testimony to the rich overseas exchanges of the region.

Okinoshima is home to priceless artifacts, including these unearthed copper mirrors from the Tang Dynasty of China between the seventh and 10th centuries.

Since ancient Japanese rituals only began to be recorded after the 8th century CE, the island is a crucial source of information about the development of religion in Japan."

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-healthcare-idUSKBN19V0YP,HEALTHCARE DISAGREEMENTS ROIL U.S. SENATE REPUBLICANS,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican senators returned to Washington on Monday following a 10-day holiday recess still at odds with one another over legislation President Donald Trump wants passed to repeal major portions of Obamacare. With only three weeks left before a summer recess scheduled to stretch until Sept. 5, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared determined to keep trying to find agreement on a partisan, all-Republican bill. If he cannot, he will be faced with giving up on a seven-year Republican promise to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare - and possibly turning to Democrats for help in fixing problems with U.S. health insurance markets. The Republican legislation would phase out the Obamacare expansion of Medicaid health insurance for the poor and disabled, sharply cut federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025, repeal most of Obamacare's taxes, end a penalty on Americans who do not obtain insurance and overhaul Obamacare's subsidies to help people buy insurance with tax credits. Democrats call the Republican legislation a giveaway to the rich that would hurt millions of the most vulnerable Americans. Since the start of 2017, when they took control of the White House, Republicans who also control Congress have been struggling over how to replace former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature legislation - which they see as  government intrusion - with less comprehensive federal healthcare provisions. Conservative Republican Senator Ted Cruz favors offering a choice of cheaper healthcare plans that would not have to meet minimum standards established by Obamacare, such as coverage for maternity care and prescription drugs. Moderate Republican Senator Susan Collins dismissed that approach on Monday, telling reporters: ""I believe that it would cause further destabilization of the individual (insurance) market, it would erode protections for people with pre-existing conditions"" and cause premiums to rise. Earlier on Monday, Trump used Twitter to prod Republican senators to pass a bill, and senior lawmakers, including the Senate's No. 2 Republican, John Cornyn, said legislation could advance to votes next week in the deeply divided chamber.  ""I cannot imagine that Congress would dare to leave Washington without a beautiful new HealthCare bill fully approved and ready to go!"" tweeted Trump, who made repealing and replacing Obamacare a central pledge of his 2016 campaign. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives approved its healthcare bill in May, knowing the Senate would amend it. Republican Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota told reporters he was worried about how rural hospitals would be treated in the Senate bill, which is being assembled in secret. He said lawmakers were awaiting an assessment of a retooled Senate bill from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office before making decisions. Senior Republican Orrin Hatch said he did not yet know whether the minimum 50 Republican senators would come together on a bill, with Vice President Mike Pence casting the potential tiebreaking vote. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer wrote to McConnell urging a bipartisan effort to stabilize the health insurance market, noting that McConnell had been quoted recently as saying Congress would need to shore up that market if lawmakers fail to repeal Obamacare. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued data on Monday showing a 38 percent decrease in applications by insurers to sell health plans in the Obamacare individual market in 2018 compared with this year. Scores of protesters voiced opposition to the legislation outside Republican National Committee headquarters and at the offices of some Republican lawmakers, chanting slogans including ""Trumpcare kills"" and ""Healthcare is a human right.""  U.S. Capitol Police said 80 people were arrested.

The spike in bond yields is just getting started, according to legendary fixed-income investor Jeffrey Gundlach. For Ray Dalio at the worlds largest hedge fund, the era of central-bank stimulus is now over.Bond market stress showed signs this week of spilling over into stocks as well as other assets from gold to silver.

That hurdle is getting closer.Read more on the details of the action in our markets wrapSure, there have been calls before that the three-decade bond bull-market is finished, only for fixed-income returns to rally back. The Federal Reserve may well be close to cutting the size of its balance sheet and European policy makers are inching toward tighter policy, but cash is still sloshing around at the Bank of Japan ready to buy bonds.The last time simultaneous declines occurred between bonds and stocks was during the taper tantrum in 2013 when the Fed hinted at reduced stimulus. Of course, the S&P 500 Index has returned above 10 percent a year since then.The Wall Street consensus for higher bond yields this year had been tested from the highs reached in March for 10-year Treasuries as investors doused expectations for a growth boost spurred by Donald Trumps administration. A slide to 2 percent then looked far more likely than a rally to 3 percent until central banks in Europe, the U.K. and Canada last month all delivered more hawkish commentary.A rout in Treasuries and bunds intensified this week as the European Central Bank said its contemplating removing from its message a long-standing pledge to expand or extend the banks bond-purchase program if necessary. Global equities are on course for a second weekly loss, while gold and silver are declining as higher bond yield pressure non-interest bearing assets.The recent selloff is a sign of more pain to come for U.S. bond bulls, according to Gundlach, DoubleLine Capitals chief executive officer, which oversees $109 billion.The last time the yield on 10-year Treasuries reached 3 percent was more than three years ago, when the Fed was still in full loosening mode and the Bank of Japans easing policy was expanding. Gundlach expects that to happen again, without specifying the time frame. The yield closed above 3 percent on just two days in December 2013.Still, Australian government debt auctions this week showed demand remains strong from yield-hungry investors, aided by the local central banks refusal to follow peers in taking a hawkish tilt.

http://cnn.com/2017/07/06/opinions/nic-robertson-g20-opinion/index.html,"TRUMP, PUTIN AND ERDOGAN: THE THREE MEN UPENDING GLOBAL DIPLOMACY","Nic Robertson is CNN's international diplomatic editor. The opinions in this article belong to the author.

(CNN) Ever heard the one about the three world leaders who walked into a meeting room?

The first says: ""I'm the most powerful man in the room -- 33 million people follow me on Twitter.""

The second says: ""I'm the most powerful man in the room -- I've banned Twitter.""

And the third says: ""No, I'm the most powerful man in the room -- I've got all the passwords.""

The punch line, of course, is that no one can tell any of them that they are wrong.

Although we are hardly likely to hear Presidents Donald Trump, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Vladimir Putin engage in such discourse at the G20 in Hamburg , it's not beyond reason to believe these men are capable of such thought.

While each is at a different stage of his leadership -- Putin has been at it for years, Erdogan cemented control of his a few months ago and Trump is a relative newbie on the world stage -- they are all currently emerging as great global disruptors.

The G20 summit in Hamburg comes at time of particular global disunity. Elder statesmen and women of diplomacy have declared that the post-WWII world order is over, potentially leaving decades of dependable stability in terminal decline.

As today's most powerful 20 leaders gather in Germany's northern port city, some among them may cast an eye across the city's skyline remembering when much here looked as Mosul does today: crumpled and broken by war.

In July 1943, allied bombers began an aerial bombing campaign, Operation Gomorrah. In just eight days, 42,000 civilians were killed and 37,000 were injured.

The awfulness of that war and the international desire to never again allow megalomaniacs to hold complete global sway is part of what makes the meeting of world leaders at the G20 today so important. It is, partly, why we should all care that some of the many grievances that these leaders will grudgingly discuss here do get resolved.

It doesn't help that some of those arriving in Hamburg toting the biggest bags of diplomatic gripes and animus are world leaders buried so far in their own beliefs that they've lost sight of the art of compromise.

JUST WATCHED Trump heads to summit amid disagreements with G20 nations Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump heads to summit amid disagreements with G20 nations 04:42

Take Putin. Did he ever say sorry for Russia's role in the US elections? Has he given Crimea back to Ukraine, or even considered ending its illegal annexation? Has he ever stopped to think that President Bashar al-Assad -- whom he backs in Syria's civil war -- might, after murdering hundreds of thousands of his own people, not be fit to lead the country any more?

And then we have Trump, whose own wife admits that when he's challenged he punches back 10 times harder

He comes to the G20 a global outlier on climate change. Shortly after the G7 summit in May, he snubbed the other leaders by dumping Barack Obama's commitment to the Paris climate accord.

And like Putin, Trump's disruptions are not singular. He has recently ratcheted up tension with China, courting controversy over weapon sales to Taiwan and testing waters around disputed islands -- not to mention his tough talk on trade.

All of that baggage seems to sink any hope of a meeting of minds on North Korea, something other G20 leaders were hoping might walk the region back from the risk of nuclear-tipped confrontation.

Of course this is exactly the impact North Korea's Kim Jong Un will have hoped for.

His test-launch of what Secretary of Sate Rex Tillerson described as an intercontinental ballistic missile not only raises the stakes of failure, but sows doubts that his nuclear ambitions can be stopped. Already his timely provocation has united Russia and China in Trump's face.

Trump arrives in Hamburg also at odds with his host, German Chancellor Angela Merkel , on trade and on climate change. How much they might agree on Russia, Syria and Ukraine is unclear, in part because until now Trump hasn't made clear his own position on any of these issues or what his long-term policy might look like.

They will both likely agree that the other outsized strongman attending -- Turkey's President Erdogan -- is an emerging problem child. Not only because he administered a referendum that delivered the powers of Parliament to his hands in the presidency, but also his penchant for riotous assembly.

Having seen how Erdogan's security team beat protestors when Erdogan visited Trump in Washington several weeks ago, Merkel has blocked Erdogan's request to hold rallies in Germany on the sidelines of the summit.

Trump's problems with Erdogan are bigger than Merkel's. As fighting in the Syrian war appears to be reaching its conclusion -- ISIS is losing its grip of its previous stronghold and de facto capital in Raqqa -- Trump's arming of Kurdish fighters to kill ISIS fighters angers Erdogan, who considers both ISIS and the Kurdish forces to be terrorists.

For his part, Putin is happy to have Trump and Erdogan squabble over this -- it allows his ally Assad to reap the rewards.

But beyond the fight for Raqqa, the real strategic end game in Syria is the race for the ISIS-riddled eastern town of Deir Ezzor. It'll be the hidden subtext of any G20 talk over Syria.

If Assad gets there first, then he, Russia and Iran control the vital highways that turn the Tehran, Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut axis into one smooth tarmac ride from the Persian mountains and Iran's mullahs to their seaside proxies Hezbollah, more than 1,000 miles away in Lebanon.

This outcome is unpalatable to G20 member Saudi Arabia. As King Salman has canceled his visit, the diplomatic stakes are already raised. His son, the young, ambitious and recently promoted Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is likely to be far tougher to tame at the top table of global politics.

MBS, as he is known, arrives already exercised by tiny Gulf state Qatar's refusal to fall into line with his and the UAE's recent demands to cut its ties with terrorist groups, among other things. His peers at the summit will no doubt encourage the young prince to cool his jets and try to reach a deal.

This backdrop makes it unlikely that he will be in any sort of mood to compromise on Syria and see his nemesis Iran gain more traction in the region.

British Prime Minister Theresa May is up for making friends and getting deals done, but her clout is on the wane.

Yet it's not all doom and gloom. A rising international star, the fresh-faced French President Emmanuel Macron, can be expected to inject some optimism. He believes Trump can be brought in from the isolationism of ""America First.""

His first G20 could be his fellow europhile centrist Angela Merkel's last.

Germans go to the polls in the next few months. While she seems to enjoy something of a lead, not to mention the respect of many of the leaders, she could still use a positive summit to boost her popularity.

But even on this Trump is a disruptor.

He has talked Merkel down so much, criticizing her refugee policy and slamming German car sales to the US. With Merkel's decision to hold the G20 in a city center building that can be targeted by protestors, Trumps German critics will likely be heard.

Suffice to say, rarely in the field of recent global diplomacy have so many relied on so few for so much.

Therefore it's a shame, in a way, about the strongmen.

A few less of those might just have tipped the balance towards a more favourable G20 outcome.

Talking of which, did you hear about the three world leaders who left the meeting room? They all agreed that they were the best leaders at the meeting and had won all their arguments."

(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Watching a wild animal prowl its prey, nuzzle young babies or dance its mating ritual is thrilling.

Hiking, trekking and adventuring into uncharted territory to watch wildlife in its natural habitat adds an addictive level of adrenaline. And we're craving it more than ever.

Beyond the traditional African safari, travelers are searching for more fast-paced, challenging and authentic wildlife encounters. The ultimate thrill is to unearth terrain once inaccessible to travelers and come face-to-face with rare species.

These are the rising stars of wildlife travel -- those that push boundaries by plumbing Earth's extremes. Imagine scouring the depths of Djibouti's waters to swim with whale sharks or journeying into the remote Siberian Arctic to live with nomadic reindeer herders.

With these adventures, the magic and mystery of creatures great and small are unleashed:

Reindeers in Russia

Travelers can now live with the Nenets, Russia's nomadic reindeer herders.

Far above the Arctic Circle, the indigenous Nenets nomadic reindeer herders live at the edge of extremity in the Siberian Arctic.

You must journey by train, bus and Trekol, a monster truck, to reach their isolated land, where few people have stepped foot. The Nenets have just started welcoming intrepid explorers to live and learn with them.

This trip is challenging to any adventurer's limits. In frozen tundra where temperatures plummet to minus 50 Celsius (minus 58 Fahrenheit), the Nenets rely on reindeer herds. Reindeer sledding, fishing, hiking and camping with the Nenets people is as offbeat a wildlife travel adventure as it can get.

How to get there: A 15-day trip via Moscow and St. Petersburg with A 15-day trip via Moscow and St. Petersburg with Intrepid Travel costs from $2,880. Visa assistance is also available.

Elephants in Gabon

Packrafting in the wilderness of Gabon's Ivindo National Park is not a typical safari.

Expeditioners have reported peacefully paddling past gorillas in their lush natural environments, with forest elephants mere meters away in untouched jungle and wily chimpanzees leaping the treetops.

Floating amid dripping towering forests, deep dark braided rivers and equatorial Africa's highest waterfall in a tiny rubber paddleboat feels out-of-this-world. Expect to see no other people.

Gabon is positioning itself as an eco-friendly wildlife tourism destination. This pioneering human-powered adventure of camping, trekking and paddling is reserved for the brave and fit.

How to get there: Secret Compass's 16-day packrafting expedition is open to participant applications. Prices start at about $4,500. Secret Compass's 16-day packrafting expedition is open to participant applications. Prices start at about $4,500.

Fossa finding in Madagascar

Sunset at L'Allee des Baobabs is as spectacular as the wildlife encountered in Madagascar.

Madagascar's largest carnivorous predator, the fossa, can grow to six feet in length. Seeing one is rare but impressive.

A cross between a cat and mongoose, the fossa is endemic to Madagascar and can be tracked in the island's Kirindy forest. Best known for its amorous mating displays, finding the fossa is a deep delve taking in many species of Baobab trees, also endemic to the fourth-largest island in the world.

Expect to meet several of Madagascar's 106 species of lemur, the majority endangered and endemic. Tracking them is a thrilling chase through steep dense rainforests and raw wilderness, chasing the haunting lemur call, which echoes through rainforests and disorientates even the best guides.

How to get there: Rothschild Safaris offers an eight-day fossa and lemur-tracking safari adventure, including a spectacular sunset at L'Allee des Baobabs and the Tsingy Unesco World Heritage Site from $2,680 pp. Rothschild Safaris offers an eight-day fossa and lemur-tracking safari adventure, including a spectacular sunset at L'Allee des Baobabs and the Tsingy Unesco World Heritage Site from $2,680 pp.

Gorillas in Democratic Republic of Congo

Organized voyages are now helping travelers explore the little-visited Kahuzi-Biega National Park.

Venturing deep into the equatorial rainforest of DR Congo's Kahuzi-Biega National Park, this is a trek to meet the small population of eastern lowland gorillas.

Organized tours offer the chance to be one of the first to explore a region that's yet to emerge as a major travel destination. The area also hosts philanthropy and conservation projects with locals, to dig beyond the headlines and spend time in a magical and misunderstood Central African country.

How to get there: A 14-day trip to DRC, Rwanda, Burundi with Wild Frontiers costs from about $7,350. Mountain gorilla permits are significantly cheaper in DRC at $400, while Rwanda has just increased them to $1,500 per person.

Polar bear Arctic expedition

Take a frozen landscape of glittering glaciers and icy tundra, throw in an Arctic Sea filled with rare beluga, blue and bowhead whales and add land residents of snoozing bearded seals, blubbery walrus and Arctic reindeer, and you have the best reasons to cruise Norway's remote Spitsbergen.

""His statements about Syria really disturb me. No, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin does not have it right when it comes to Syria,"" Senator Lindsey Graham said. In separate television interviews, Graham and Senator John McCain, prominent Republican foreign policy voices, took aim at Tillerson's remarks last week that Russia may have ""got the right approach"" and the United States the wrong approach to Syria. Russia has backed President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's civil war, while the United States supports rebel groups trying to overthrow him. McCain told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that he ""sometimes"" regretted backing Tillerson's nomination by Republican President Donald Trump and that his comments on Russia being ""right"" on Syria made him emotional and upset. ""I know what the slaughter has been like. I know that the Russians knew that Bashar Assad was going to use chemical weapons. And to say that maybe we've got the wrong approach?"" he said. Both senators backed the nomination of Tillerson in January, even while expressing concern about his dealings with Russia when he was chief executive of ExxonMobil. (XOM.N) Graham, who visited Afghanistan and Pakistan last week with McCain, accused Tillerson of being ""AWOL"" on the two countries and failing to fill key State Department posts. ""I am so worried about the State Department, Graham said  on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" A State Department official responded to the criticism of Tillerson by saying that a U.S.-Russian-brokered ceasefire for southwest Syria was an example of what the secretary had described as the potential to coordinate with Russia, in spite of unresolved differences, ""to produce stability and serve our mutual security interests."" The official, who did not want to be identified, also said the State Department was taking an active role in a review of Afghanistan and Pakistan policy and continued to work with the White House on nominations. Since the exit of most foreign troops in 2014, Afghanistans U.S.-backed government has lost ground to a Taliban insurgency in a war that kills and maims thousands of civilians each year.

Unconventional shale oil and alternative energy resources are an important factor to help meet future demand but it is premature to assume that they can be developed quickly to replace oil and gas, Amin Nasser told a conference in Istanbul. ""If we look at the long-term situation of oil supplies, for example, the picture is becoming increasingly worrying,"" Nasser said. ""Financial investors are shying away from making much needed large investments in oil exploration, long-term development and the related infrastructure.  Investments in smaller increments such as shale oil will just not cut it,"" Nasser said. About $1 trillion in investments have already been lost since a decline in oil prices from 2014. Studies show that 20 million barrels per day of new production will be needed to meet demand growth and offset natural decline of developed fields over the next five years, he said.  ""New discoveries are also on a major downward trend. The volume of conventional oil discovered around the world over the past four years has more than halved compared with the previous four,"" Nasser said. ""A lack of investment is definitely not helping, so if that continues over the next couple of years there will be an inflection point where what we see today will have an impact on consumers at the end and supply will be impacted for the next couple of years,"" Nasser told CNBC. ""What we need to see is more investments from various sectors to make sure there is an adequate supply over the long term,"" he said to CNBC. State oil giant Aramco, which is preparing to sell around 5 percent in itself next year in an initial public offering, is continuing to invest in maintaining its oil production capacity of 12 million barrels per day. ""We plan to invest more than $300 billion over the coming decade to reinforce our pre-eminent position in oil, maintain our spare oil production capacity, and pursue a large exploration and production program centering on conventional and unconventional gas resources,"" Nasser said. Nasser reiterated the IPO was on track for the second half of 2018. Asked by CNBC if the current oil price will possibly delay the IPO, Nasser said the company's investments are ""geared towards the long term."" ""Even though we have the highest 260 billion of reserves we have the biggest exploration program,"" he told CNBC. Nasser said in his speech that one of Aramco's priorities was ""direct conversion of crude oil into petrochemicals"" while adding the company was also focusing on solar and wind projects.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/07/us/georgia-stabbing-court-thumbs-up/index.html,MOTHER ACCUSED OF FATALLY STABBING FAMILY GIVES THUMBS-UP IN COURT,"(CNN) The mother accused of fatally stabbing four of her children and their father appeared to pray, smiled and gave a thumbs-up to cameras during a bizarre court appearance Friday in Georgia.

Isabel Martinez, 33, was arrested Thursday and accused of fatally stabbing her husband, Martin Romero, and four of her children , ranging in age from 1 to 10. A fifth child also was stabbed but survived. Daughter Diana Romero, who is 9, was in serious but stable condition at a children's hospital in Atlanta, police said.

Martinez appeared in court Friday to face five counts of murder, five counts of malice murder and six counts of aggravated assault.

Looking directly into the court camera, she repeatedly smiled and gave double thumbs-up signs. At various points, she spread her arms out wide, put her hands together as if in prayer and even left her seat to kneel on the ground.

Isabel Martinez gives a thumbs-up to cameras as she appears in court Friday in Lawrenceville, Georgia.

Martinez shook her head and then wagged her finger at the camera as the judge reviewed the charges.

""Ma'am, I'm going to caution you to cut out the display for the cameras,"" Gwinnett County Magistrate Judge Michael Thorpe said. ""It's really not a good idea, probably not to your benefit.""

Martinez qualified for a court-appointed attorney, but she said she did not need one.

""My attorneys (are) the people that we're fighting for,"" she said in Spanish through an interpreter.

The judge said he couldn't force her to accept counsel, but he recommended that she do so.

""My attorneys are always going to be the people and my faith. Those are my attorneys, that's why I'm here. It doesn't matter anything else,"" she said through the interpreter.

A smiling Martinez holds her hands together as if in prayer Friday in court.

""I'm representing the people that's humble, that's hardworking, the people that suffer, the people that have a lot of charges so that they understand that everything is possible through God,"" she said.

As she left court, the judge muttered an audible aside: ""Wasn't that delightful?""

Martinez is being held without bond at the Gwinnett County Jail for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, authorities said.

Martinez is a Mexican national who entered the United States illegally, ICE spokesman Bryan Cox said in a statement Friday. She crossed the border at an unknown time and location, Cox said.

Gwinnett County police discovered a bloody scene at Martinez's home shortly before 5 a.m. Thursday in Loganville, about 30 miles east of Atlanta.

""This is a horrendous crime, not only for the victims but for the extended family, neighborhood and community,"" police said. ""We are hoping and praying that the remaining victim survives.""

Police said Martinez has been cooperative. They did not release a motive for the slayings.

On Friday, neighbors and community members set up a memorial featuring candles, stuffed animals and a cross outside Martinez's home to mourn the loss of the family.

Pedro Ramirez, a neighbor, told CNN sister network HLN that Martinez used to be a positive person, but her behavior changed when her father died recently. He said she seemed depressed and stressed out.

""It's difficult. It's sad,"" he said. ""It's just difficult to see the candles, these really good people that we used to get along with really well."""

Ivanka, who ran an eponymous clothing and jewelry business before taking a formal job at the White House, has made women's issues one of her signature policy areas, and the G20 revealed the power she wields as a trusted confidante to the president. The World Bank used the occasion to launch a public-private loan program aimed at providing over $1 billion to support women entrepreneurs in developing countries, a project Ivanka first initiated just five months ago. ""This is not a cute little project,"" World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said at the kick-off, attended by six of the 20 world leaders at the summit, plus leaders from other donor countries and IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde. ""This is going to be a major driver of economic growth in the future ... and its going to drive gender equality at the same time, Kim said. He underscored the importance of having a ""champion"" like Ivanka Trump to galvanize action on an important issue. Later, as leaders met behind closed doors, Ivanka briefly sat in her father's chair during a session on African development, as the World Bank president spoke. Her appearance triggered a flurry of tweets and caught the attention of mass-circulation daily Bild, which carried a photograph of her on its website with the headline: Trumps replacement: Ivanka Trump suddenly appears at negotiating table. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has worked with Ivanka on related issues, dismissed the kerfuffle at a news conference after the G20 summit ended. ""The delegations decide who will sit at the table if the president isnt there, which can happen from time to time. And Ivanka belongs to the U.S. delegation,"" Merkel said, noting other delegations do the same thing. ""Its well known that she works in the White House and is responsible for several initiatives,"" Merkel said. The World Bank said the fund for women entrepreneurs had attracted $325 million from donors including Germany, the United States, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and would be matched by hundreds of millions of dollars in additional private capital. The program, which aims to start awarding loans before year end, will work with governments ""to improve laws and regulations that are stifling women entrepreneurs"" and push banks to free up funds for female-owned businesses. It will also create an online mentoring tool to match women business owners in developing countries with advisers such as Ivanka Trump, Kim said. As for Trump, he told leaders at the World Bank event that he was very proud of Ivanka. ""A champion. She's a champion. If she werent my daughter, it would be so much easier for her,"" Trump said, drawing laughter. ""Might be the only bad thing she has going, if you want to know the truth,"" he said.

Thats helped Europe outpace dealmaking in the U.S. and Asia, where spending fell 8.6 percent and 11 percent respectively in the first half, the data show.The effect of many of the current political situations around the world is forcing European players to think about European consolidation, said Luigi de Vecchi, Citigroup Inc.s chairman of corporate investment banking in continental Europe. The stars are aligned and politically, industrially and financially, the time is now.Its been the biggest deals, with buyers paying $10 billion or more, thats driven European M&A growth this year, according to David Lomer, co-head of M&A in EMEA at JPMorgan Chase & Co.Mergers have been a defining feature of 2017, particularly in the U.K. and Southern Europe, Lomer said.Among the biggest deals globally this year are:Growth and value creation through M&A is firmly back on the agenda in the European boardroom, said Cathal Deasy, head of M&A for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Credit Suisse Group AG in London. After a subdued 2016 for European acquirers, particularly within Europe, we have seen a robust bounce back in the first half and expect activity to continue for the remainder of the year.Buyers announced almost $200 billion in deals involving companies based in the Mediterranean countries of France, Spain and Italy this year through June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Thats about 60 percent above the volume announced in the first half of 2016. Political reforms -- such as Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoys work to rein in the countrys deficit -- are beginning to pay off and European buyers that had been looking abroad to diversify their holdings are starting to look for deals at home.Southern European lenders seeking to clean up their balance sheets from their exposure to toxic real estate assets have also triggered mergers and investment opportunities for financial investors keen to snatch up particular assets.Banco Santander SA stepped in to take over smaller rival Banco Popular Espanol SA last month before the bank collapsed under a mountain of bad property loans. The Brussels-based Single Resolution Board, set up in January 2015 to deal with euro-area bank failures and minimize impact on financial stability and taxpayers, forced the sale in its first major action.The regional uptick has propelled local investment banks up the league tables. Italys Mediobanca SpA is among the top five advisers on Europe-to-Europe deals so far this year, the data show.Beyond corporate M&A in Europe, which will continue in the coming months, financial investors will play an important role given high levels of liquidity and benign financing conditions, both in lending and capital markets, said Francesco Canzonieri, Mediobancas global head of corporate finance and country head for Italy."

The Reubens had bought the debt after a default by Sahara India Pariwar, controlled by Subrata Roy, who was imprisoned in India in 2014 for allegedly defrauding investors. The Reubens had scheduled an auction for the Plaza early last year, then canceled it after negotiating a debt extension.

http://cnn.com/2017/07/05/health/alzheimers-sleep-dementia-study/index.html,CAN POOR SLEEP LEAD TO ALZHEIMER'S?,"(CNN) One in three Americans doesn't get enough sleep, and 45% of the world's population doesn't, either. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls that a ""public health problem,"" because disrupted sleep is associated with a higher risk of conditions including diabetes, stroke and cardiovascular disease.

It may not be long before we can add Alzheimer's and other types of dementia to that list.

It's well known that people with Alzheimer's suffer sleep issues. Insomnia, nighttime wandering and daytime sleepiness are common for them, as well as other cognitive disorders such as Lewy body dementia and frontal lobe dementia.

But could poor sleep earlier in life actually cause dementia?

Sleep and dementia

A growing body of research in both mice and humans shows that disturbed sleep leads to higher levels of soluble beta amyloid, the protein that folds and forms the sticky plaques that kill brain cells and bog down information processing. Depositing amyloid in brain tissue is the first known preclinical stage of Alzheimer's and happens well before any obvious symptoms of dementia begin.

A few studies in cognitively normal people and one in mice have shown a connection between chronic sleep disruption and the development of amyloid plaques. The research in mice was particularly interesting because it showed that mice who slept well reduced their levels of beta amyloid, effectively clearing the toxin from their brains.

new study in Neurology, the journal for the American Academy of Neurology, is adding to that research by looking at the relationship between sleep quality and levels of various proteins and inflammatory markers in the cerebrospinal fluid of 101 cognitively healthy adults with an average age of 63.

All participants had known risk factors for Alzheimer's, such as family history or evidence of the APOE gene , which is associated with a greater chance of developing the disease. Their sleep quality was rated on a standard scale that measured amount, quality and trouble sleeping, along with daytime drowsiness and naps.

""Participants in our study were willing to undergo a lumbar puncture to move research on Alzheimer's disease forward,"" said co-author Barbara Bendlin of the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. ""Analyzing this fluid allowed us to look at markers related to Alzheimer's disease such as plaques and tangles, as well as markers of inflammation and nerve cell damage.""

Tangles and cell damage

Tangles are created by damaged tau, a protein responsible for cell stability and structure. Recent research points to tau-tangle accumulation as a possible step beyond amyloid plaques in the development of actual signs of Alzheimer's disease.

By comparing the spinal fluid against self-reported sleep problems, Bendlin and her colleagues found that the subjects who had sleep issues were more likely to show evidence of tau pathology, brain cell damage and inflammation, even when other factors like depression, body mass, cardiovascular disease and sleep medications were taken into account.

""Our findings align with the idea that worse sleep may contribute to the accumulation of Alzheimer's-related proteins in the brain,"" Bendlin said. ""The fact that we can find these effects in people who are cognitively healthy and close to middle age suggest that these relationships appear early, perhaps providing a window of opportunity for intervention.""

That's important, Bendlin added, because delaying the onset of Alzheimer's in those at risk by a mere five years ""could reduce the number of cases we see in the next 30 years by 5.7 million and save $367 billion in health care spending.""

Ju also studies the association between sleep and dementia, and she co-wrote an ""Another new finding in this study is that daytime sleepiness, and not just disrupted nighttime sleep, is associated with early changes of Alzheimer's disease,"" said Dr. Yo-El Ju, an assistant professor of neurology at Washington University'sSleep Medicine Center.Ju also studies the association between sleep and dementia, and she co-wrote an accompanying editorial for the new study.

""Overall, this study confirms the relationship between early Alzheimer's disease and sleep disturbance,"" Ju said, ""and (it) expands -- in terms of both time and symptoms -- the window in which sleep-wake problems can be assessed for and treated, with the hope of reducing the risk of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.""

One of the limitations of the study was that the sleep problems were self-reported. Bendlin and her colleagues are recruiting people at risk for Alzheimer's to be studied in a sleep lab, where objective measurements can be taken.

""If it turns out to be the case that an intervention which improves sleep also results in less amyloid being deposited in the brain, that would provide strong support for implementing interventions before people start to show cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease,"" she said.

Dr. Rudolph Tanzi, who directs the genetics and aging research unit at Massachusetts General Hospital, agreed.

""Increasing amounts of evidence indicate that getting at least seven to eight hours of sleep is essential for brain health and function,"" Tanzi said. ""In the deepest stage of sleep, the brain cleans itself out of plaque and other toxic materials that trigger Alzheimer's disease. This reduces brain inflammation and is entirely consistent with this exciting new study.""

Which problem came first?

Not everyone with sleep problems in the study had abnormalities in their spinal fluid. For example, those with obstructive sleep apnea showed no association. Bendlin stresses that much remains to be discovered about the link between sleep and dementia.

""Not everyone who experiences sleep problems should now worry about developing dementia due to Alzheimer's disease,"" she said, adding that there is not yet a clear cause and effect relationship.

""Animal studies suggest sleep affects development of brain changes, but brain changes in turn also affect sleep,"" Bendlin said. ""In terms of figuring out which comes first, brain changes or sleep problems, that will be difficult to tease apart, because the effects really do appear to be going in both directions.""

""In experimental studies, there does seems to be evidence of both chicken and egg,"" said neuroscientist Jeffrey Iliff of Oregon Health and Sciences University. ""You can drive it either direction. So there may be a bio-directional interaction.""

That's good news if true, he said, because it means we have may have some control over whether we develop dementia.

""No, the public can't remove amyloid plaque,"" Iliff said. ""But if sleep disruption is promoting this process, then improving sleep is half of the solution to slowing the process of dementia as it develops over one's life.""

Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer's Association, agreed: ""This new study suggests there may be an opportunity to improve cognition and possibly reduce dementia risk through early diagnosis and effective treatment of sleep disorders."""
http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/01/politics/sutter-epa-nyt-doubt-climate-change/index.html,"CLIMATE CONFUSION IS BACK, AND IT'S DANGEROUS","John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN who focuses on climate change and social justice. Follow him on Snapchat , Twitter and Facebook or subscribe to his email newsletter.

(CNN) Until Friday night, the eve of the People's Climate March on Washington , the US government website EPA.gov/climatechange explained how humans are warming the planet by burning fossil fuels and why that is a huge deal for us and for future generations.

Now the page carries an Orwellian message: ""This page is being updated.""

""Thank you for your interest in this topic,"" the message continues. ""We are currently updating our website to reflect EPA's priorities under the leadership of President [Donald] Trump and [US Environmental Protection Agency] Administrator [Scott] Pruitt.""

It's been clear for months, if not years, what Donald Trump and his appointees think of climate change. At worst, they call it a hoax. At best, they say it's overblown -- no big deal. We need more science , they claim, while also moving to strip government science agencies of funding . They want us to keep debating the climate crisis while they make it worse.

That is troubling, not only because Trump's retrograde fossil-fuel policies are likely to contribute to all the bad things that come along with human-induced global warming, from worsening droughts to faster-rising seas and mass extinction. It is troubling because Trump and his administration are "" gaslighting"" the American public on the science of climate change.

Following a playbook that seems to be written by the tobacco industry, the Trump administration and other prominent skeptics inject uncertainty and confusion into climate policy where it doesn't belong.

And the strategy appears to be working. Climate confusion is back into the American zeitgeist.

What EPA climate websites used to look like Some EPA climate-change websites have been taken down for revision by the Trump administration. The Internet Archive preserves previous versions of these pages. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ EPA.gov/climatechange Ã¢ÂÂ¢ EPA.gov/cleanpowerplan Ã¢ÂÂ¢ EPA.gov/climate-change-science Ã¢ÂÂ¢ EPA.gov/climate-impacts

In other words: Nearly certain. Worth betting on. ""Extremely likely.""

Yet, Trump and others who hold the megaphone these days fixate on the thinnest slivers of doubt.

On Friday, the same day as the EPA website changes (which also included the removal of some other climate change-related websites for revision, including one on the Clean Power Plan), The New York Times ran a debut op-ed by columnist Bret Stephens . In the piece, Stephens seemed to rationalize skepticism about climate change and its potentially dire outcomes. ""Claiming total certainty about the science traduces the spirit of science and creates openings for doubt whenever a climate claim proves wrong ... None of this is to deny climate change or the possible severity of its consequences,"" Stephens wrote. ""But ordinary citizens also have a right to be skeptical of an overweening scientism."" The implication seems to be: Take climate change with a grain of salt; assume it's real but ... maybe not? Or maybe its consequences are overblown.

It's reasonable to acknowledge there are probabilities and uncertainties inherent in scientific predictions. It's dangerous, however, to overstate uncertainty and use it to justify inaction. All the best science tells us that more greenhouse gases are dangerous for the planet, posing an expensive and potentially existential threat to life as we know it.

There is no left-leaning or right-leaning climate science, just as there is no Republican or Democrat theory of gravity. Stefan Rahmstorf, Potsdam University

""CO2 traps heat -- more CO2 means a warmer climate,"" he continued. ""That is basic physics, borne out by the history of climate. Denying these well-established facts is about as smart as claiming the Earth is flat, and best left to cranks, ideologues and fossil fuel lobbyists.""

""With climate change, each time we add more carbon pollution to the atmosphere, we increase the odds of a climate catastrophe a little bit more. The smart move is to mitigate that risk by cutting down on our burning of fossil fuels as quickly as possible. Stephens' piece is akin to criticizing doctors and anti-smoking groups for being too mean to the tobacco industry, and for not focusing on the uncertainty about exactly when the chain-smoking patient will develop cancer.""

Trump and the rest seem to want us to keep smoking the planet -- despite well-proven risks.

Yet, government spin doesn't change reality.

It doesn't have to change our perception of it, either."

Daimlers Mercedes-Benz luxury brand, its main division, introduced the planned EQ all-electric line at the show on Thursday.Daimler, Renault and Nissan acquired 3.1 percent stakes in each other when they started cooperating.

Renault already supplies electric engines for the Smart that are also used in the French manufacturers battery-powered Zoe.We started this collaboration based on three projects where we saw benefits for both partners, and now we have 13 or 14 or 15 projects already producing a lot of benefits, Zetsche said. Thats a strong foundation for our partnership.

http://cnn.com/2017/07/10/opinions/rex-tillerson-diplomacy-test-opinion-miller/index.html,QATAR CRISIS: CAN REX TILLERSON FIX THIS MESS?,"Aaron David Miller is a vice president and distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and was a Middle East negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations. Richard Sokolsky is a non-resident senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. From 2005-2015, he served as a member of the State Department's policy planning office. This piece has been updated since its original publication. The opinions in this article belong to the authors.

(CNN) For the past six months, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has been treading water. On Tuesday, the US diplomat begins his maiden voyage into the stormy seas of Middle East shuttle diplomacy . We're about to find out whether he can navigate them.

The matter at hand is a bitter conflict pitting Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt against Qatar. All these countries are U.S. security partners, vital to achieving the Trump Administration's Middle East goals.

Tillerson has a thankless assignment . He faces long odds against a definitive resolution, but also has the possibility to broker a temporary fix.

If Tillerson is to have any hope of achieving that outcome he needs to have the right answers to the following five questions.

Does the President have my back?

The Secretary shouldn't have traveled if the answer is no -- and right now the answer is unclear.

From the beginning of this crisis , it's been apparent that Tillerson wanted to mediate fairly.

President Trump , on the other hand, under the spell of the King and the new crown prince, came down squarely on the Saudi's side.

Success will be beyond Tillerson's reach if the White House and Foggy Bottom are not on the same page. At a minimum, the President should call the Saudis, Qataris, and Emiratis to make certain they know that he's empowered Tillerson to reach a deal and expects them to be flexible. Any other presidential message during Tillerson's mission will be fatal. The Saudis won't bend if they believe Trump has their back instead of his own Secretary of State's.

Is the timing right?

It's not clear. The ideal solution would be one reached by the parties or by a regional mediator. So far, the Kuwaitis have not been able to mediate successfully.

In any negotiation, timing is critical to a mediator's success. It is doubtful that either side is feeling enough pain to make serious compromises.

JUST WATCHED Al Jazeera: ""We demand press freedom"" Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Al Jazeera: ""We demand press freedom"" 01:02

If there is no sense of shared urgency the secretary of state won't be coming home any time soon, or will return home empty handed after a week of being diddled and used by both sides. It is surely possible, however, that Tillerson has received signals that both sides are willing to compromise but will only make concessions to the US and not to one another.

Does Tillerson have any leverage?

Probably not much. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker has made it clear that he's not prepared to go ahead with arms sales to our partners in the Gulf until this dispute is resolved.

But it's doubtful that the Trump administration is willing to put its relationship with both countries on the line by squeezing either of them. Al Udeid air base in Qatar is simply too important to US military operations in the region to put at risk.

As for the Saudis, Trump's apparent infatuation with them means he is unlikely to play hardball. This leaves Tillerson with few cards to play and the prospect of a lengthy negotiation.

The impulsive new Saudi crown prince has a lot at stake in cutting Qatar down to size and will not bend easily to compromise. This means that unless Tillerson is prepared to publicly shame either or both parties (his only source of leverage), it's hard to see the use of coercion rather than persuasion as the way to reach any agreement.

Is Washington willing to take ownership of a deal?

Any agreement will have to be monitored and enforced if it is to remain durable. The Gulf states have a long history of reaching agreements and then fumbling on implementation.

In fact, that is largely what happened in 2014, when all the other Gulf Arab states downgraded their diplomatic relations with the Qataris over essentially the same issues that are on the table now.

It took nine months for these countries to return their ambassadors to Doha after the two sides papered over their differences with pledges that were not effectively implemented. The US will most likely have to do some of the monitoring particularly when it comes to terror financing.

Can Tillerson cut a deal?

Maybe a partial or temporary one. The Saudi/UAE-Qatari confrontation is longstanding, reflecting two realities.

The first is Saudi Arabia''s desire to be master of the Arab Gulf and the Gulf Cooperation Council and to cut Qatar down to size, by denying it freedom of action, as well as the ability to choose its own allies -- such as Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood. The Saudis, Emiratis and Egyptians view these other Islamic groups as major threats.

The second is Qatar's fierce determination to protect its very identity, which is inextricably linked to its independence and freewheeling style.

Some of the grievances against Qatar are legitimate and perhaps can be addressed by Tillerson -- for example, using the US to monitor terror financing -- and wrapped into a package to defuse this round of tensions.

But even if Tillerson can manage an agreement that defuses the current crisis, it won't fix the problem. Saudi Arabia, particularly under the leadership of the crown prince, seems determined to turn Qatar into a semi-vassal state, and if he could, he would engineer regime change.

However, even if Qatar agrees to tone down al-Jazeera programing and stop funding and hosting unfriendly Islamists, Doha won't abandon its independent foreign policy nor cut ties with Iran, with whom it shares a huge natural gas field.

Tillerson may end up in a truly thankless spot. If he fails in his first highly personalized diplomatic role, the media will hammer him as will his boss if he pushes the Saudis too hard. If he succeeds, the US might end up with a temporary fix that could easily come undone.

Tillerson appears to have initiated this mission on his own. We can admire his risk-readiness. But the Secretary may be about to discover that, as Lebanese historian Kamal Salibi has said, great powers meddle in the affairs of small tribes at their own risk."

The teen apparel retailer said Monday it has ended discussions about a possible sale. It was only two months ago that the company had put itself on the shopping block.

Shares of Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) plunged nearly 20% in early trading on the news to their lowest levels since mid-2000. The stock is now down almost 90% from the all-time highs it hit in 2007.

But A&F chairman Arthur Martinez said in a press release that the retailer ""determined that the best path to enhance value for stockholders is the rigorous execution of our business plan.""

He noted that the company's Hollister brand was showing momentum and that there were strategies in place to revitalize the core A&F brand.

Wall Street remains understandably skeptical. Shoppers have largely stayed away from the retailer.

Sales have been sluggish for years. The company reported another quarterly loss in late May and analysts expect even more red ink for all of this fiscal year as well as next.

New CEO Fran Horowitz, who was promoted from chief merchandising officer to the top spot in February, has taken steps to get the company back on track. But it's been an uphill battle.

Former CEO Mike Jeffries left the company in December 2014 after a series of controversies. Jeffries made remarks about only wanting ""cool, good-looking people"" to wear his company's clothes.

A&F was also criticized by many parents for overly sexual imagery in its marketing, with models that appeared to be very young, wearing suggestive (and little) clothing in its catalog and stores.

And an ex-pilot for the company-owned Gulfstream jet (which has since been sold) filed an age discrimination suit against A&F a few years ago. The pilot claimed Jeffries had a manual that listed dress requirements for male models working on the plane.

Related: Nightmare continues for Abercrombie & Fitch

The retailer enjoyed a brief turnaround after Jeffries left and Martinez, who led Sears (SHLD) before that once-iconic company went into its own tailspin, took over as chairman

Under Martinez, the retailer de-emphasized much of the logo-based apparel that were once hugely popular at A&F and Hollister.

But A&F's apparel no longer stands out in the crowded field of teen fashion. A&F and many other mall stalwarts have struggled to compete against the new kings of retail -- fast fashion companies like Zara, H&M and Uniqlo.

Now A&F has to convince skeptical investors that it can lure back young consumers. It won't be an easy task. The American mall has been turning into a graveyard, especially for fashion retailers.

True Religion, Wet Seal, American Apparel and Aeropostale (AROPQ) have all filed for bankruptcy recently. Gap (GPS), which also owns Old Navy and Banana Republic, is still trying to turn its fortunes around. J.Crew has announced layoffs. Bebe (BEBE) is closing shop.

And apparel companies also face a big threat from Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) -- which has been bolstering its own line of clothing -- as well as Walmart (WMT), which has recently acquired several trendy online fashion retailers."

(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Watching a wild animal prowl its prey, nuzzle young babies or dance its mating ritual is thrilling.

Hiking, trekking and adventuring into uncharted territory to watch wildlife in its natural habitat adds an addictive level of adrenaline. And we're craving it more than ever.

Beyond the traditional African safari, travelers are searching for more fast-paced, challenging and authentic wildlife encounters. The ultimate thrill is to unearth terrain once inaccessible to travelers and come face-to-face with rare species.

These are the rising stars of wildlife travel -- those that push boundaries by plumbing Earth's extremes. Imagine scouring the depths of Djibouti's waters to swim with whale sharks or journeying into the remote Siberian Arctic to live with nomadic reindeer herders.

With these adventures, the magic and mystery of creatures great and small are unleashed:

Reindeers in Russia

Travelers can now live with the Nenets, Russia's nomadic reindeer herders.

Far above the Arctic Circle, the indigenous Nenets nomadic reindeer herders live at the edge of extremity in the Siberian Arctic.

You must journey by train, bus and Trekol, a monster truck, to reach their isolated land, where few people have stepped foot. The Nenets have just started welcoming intrepid explorers to live and learn with them.

This trip is challenging to any adventurer's limits. In frozen tundra where temperatures plummet to minus 50 Celsius (minus 58 Fahrenheit), the Nenets rely on reindeer herds. Reindeer sledding, fishing, hiking and camping with the Nenets people is as offbeat a wildlife travel adventure as it can get.

Packrafting in the wilderness of Gabon's Ivindo National Park is not a typical safari.

Expeditioners have reported peacefully paddling past gorillas in their lush natural environments, with forest elephants mere meters away in untouched jungle and wily chimpanzees leaping the treetops.

Floating amid dripping towering forests, deep dark braided rivers and equatorial Africa's highest waterfall in a tiny rubber paddleboat feels out-of-this-world. Expect to see no other people.

Gabon is positioning itself as an eco-friendly wildlife tourism destination. This pioneering human-powered adventure of camping, trekking and paddling is reserved for the brave and fit.

Fossa finding in Madagascar

Sunset at L'Allee des Baobabs is as spectacular as the wildlife encountered in Madagascar.

Madagascar's largest carnivorous predator, the fossa, can grow to six feet in length. Seeing one is rare but impressive.

A cross between a cat and mongoose, the fossa is endemic to Madagascar and can be tracked in the island's Kirindy forest. Best known for its amorous mating displays, finding the fossa is a deep delve taking in many species of Baobab trees, also endemic to the fourth-largest island in the world.

Expect to meet several of Madagascar's 106 species of lemur, the majority endangered and endemic. Tracking them is a thrilling chase through steep dense rainforests and raw wilderness, chasing the haunting lemur call, which echoes through rainforests and disorientates even the best guides.

In the world of fanfiction, where amateur writers spin new tales involving famous characters and other pop culture icons, anything can happen. While it's not as popular as, say, Snapchat or Katy Perry, fanfiction (also called fanfic) has a devoted following of superfans who've generated millions of stories on the internet.

Kids writing and reading: What's not to love? Well, when it comes to fanfiction, where the possibilities are limited only by imagination, there's a little more to the story.

A good portion of the fanfiction on the internet ranges in age-appropriateness from completely mild to nearly soft-core porn. And there are no barriers to reading it. Whether you're a writer or a reader, you'll come across words and images that are graphic.

If your kid is interested in writing fanfiction or just reading it, you'll want to take a look at the various sites and apps, including the most popular ones -- Wattpad, Tumblr, and WordPress -- that they might be using.

Each platform has its own rules, privacy settings, and publishing tools, which you'll want to review with your young writer to keep them safe as they explore their passion.

Review some of the key facts about fanfiction, important tips to keep in mind, and a rundown of some of the most popular platforms:

Fanfiction Facts

Fanfiction writers are fiercely protective. They know their hobby is a little nerdy and less valued in the publishing world. As a result, adherents bond over their mutual love of the subjects of their stories, as well as fanfic in general.

Fanfic is social. What's the point of writing if no one's going to read it? Fanfiction writers enthusiastically share their work and follow other writers. Part of the fun is the community that develops around specific characters, plot lines, authors, and subjects.

Fanfic can be really age-inappropriate. Not all of it is about sex -- but a lot of it is. (Get tips for managing exposure below.)

It could be the start of a career. Authors Meg Cabot (The Princess Diaries and Airhead) and Neil Gaiman (the Sandman series) have revealed that they've written fanfiction.

Devotees are vocal -- and can resort to cyberbullying. While a lot of followers are supportive, the comments, feedback, and fanfic forums can be heated and even cruel.

Fanfiction that introduces new ideas -- for example, imagining Harry Potter as a muggle (when of course we all know he's a half-blood) is non-canon or ""fanon."" Fanfic writers are divided on whether their work should be canon or whether it's OK to go rogue.

Shipping. Much of fanfiction revolves around Much of fanfiction revolves around shipping , which is the romantic pairing of characters. Often, there's a call from fans to ""ship"" specific characters -- say, Harry Styles and Bella from Twilight.

Real-person fanfiction (RPF). No celebrity, character, or content -- including YouTube stars such as Shane Dawson and Jenn McCallister -- is off-limits in fanfiction. Videos of famous people reading fanfiction about themselves -- usually mockingly -- are a fixture of YouTube (and often are super cringeworthy).

Fanfiction Tips for Parents

Encourage writing. Writing -- even if the subject matter is a little blue -- is a positive form of self-expression.

Use privacy settings. Each tool offers different ways for users to protect their privacy, from encouraging pseudonyms (which has pros and cons; see below) to restricting who can read your work to limiting comments. Kids just starting out, for example, should use stricter settings, sharing only with known friends. Once kids get familiar with the tool they're using, you can help them ease up on the settings.

Share safely. You can never predict someone's reaction to what you write. Putting yourself out there can make you vulnerable. Not every kid is ready for that even if they think they are. Try to get them to start with a small audience and grow into their hobby.

Talk about sex. Sex, love, and romance are a big part of fanfiction. The tween and teen years are when adolescents start getting interested in sex, and if they like reading and writing, they'll naturally gravitate toward a genre that explores this topic. If they write sexy stuff, ask them to keep it private or extremely limited. Posting it could attract the wrong kind of interest from other users, and sharing it -- say, with friends at school -- may not go over well.

Don't insist on reading your kids' work. If they want to share it with you, great, but if not, let it go. Just check in every now and then.

Make sure kids respect platform rules. Most fanfic services don't allow porn, hate speech, or revealing personal information about living people.

Keep an eye on the fandom. Fanatics can become obsessive. Anything that interferes with your kid's mood, schoolwork, interests, and so on could mean that something is out of whack. Check in to make sure your kid has things in perspective.

Australia's Victoria police have yet to release a list of charges against the 76-year-old cardinal and have not disclosed any information about alleged victims. Authorities only said there were multiple charges and ""multiple complainants.""

Upon his arrival on Monday, the Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney noted Pell's return ""should not be a surprise"" as Pell had said last month when he was informed of the alleged offenses in Rome that he would return to his homeland to ""vigorously defend himself and clear his name.""

Two white vehicles were waiting to whisk the cardinal away at a separate side exit of the airport. He did not answer any questions.

http://cnn.com/2017/07/10/health/hospital-sleep-noisy-alarms-study/index.html,SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF SLEEP IN HOSPITALS,"(CNN) When Dr. Joseph Schlesinger 's mother was in the hospital, it was hard to speak with her by phone above the beeps and blips of medical devices. It was even harder for her to get some shut-eye.

""She couldn't sleep at all,"" said Schlesinger, an assistant professor of anesthesiology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. ""In fact, it was very disorienting for her in the hospital.""

A noisy hospital -- not to mention interruptions by doctors and nurses and light exposure -- can make it difficult to rest when people need it most, according to researchers. And the result of a noisy hospital isn't just a groggy patient; it can also negatively affect your health, experts warn.

""Hospitals can be as loud as 72 decibels. That's like trying to talk to somebody standing next to a vacuum cleaner,"" Schlesinger said.

The World Health Organization recommends that hospital noise not exceed 30 decibels at night and 35 decibels during the day. A 2005 study at Johns Hopkins found no location in the hospital to be in compliance with WHO standards; average sound levels were in the 50 to 60 decibel range. Some parts of the hospital peaked much higher

Schlesinger has his sights set on cutting out some of the noise and getting his patients to sleep. In Vanderbilt's three-story echo-proof sound chamber, he's testing medical device sounds that are easier on the ears. In the chamber, a ring of speakers surrounds a single chair, testing a variety of sounds from different angles. The sounds, he said, should be ""alerting ... not jarring.""

But Schlesinger is also taking the reverse approach: preventing patients from hearing the device alarms that are already there. He is developing an earbud that can do just that.

""What I wanted to do was take the alarms out of the environment for the patient,"" he said. ""They don't need to hear them, and I want them to sleep.""

Schlesinger presented the pilot device last month at the International Conference on Auditory Display : a small black box connected to a microphone, a pair of headphones and a keyboard to input commands. Because medical devices often have narrow, high-pitched frequencies, a basic filter can clip out those noises without distorting other sounds, like human speech. Schlesinger said he is working with engineers to develop a standalone prototype that would be in-ear and have no delay.

Schlesinger said it's important that the device not muffle or distort other sounds, which can be disorienting for the patient. This is why simple earplugs may not always be the best choice, he added.

Products like Here One earbuds have similar technology, but Schlesinger hopes that his prototype will be better-suited for the health-care environment.

""At first glance, I am excited about this, and I do think it's innovative,"" said Erica Ryherd, associate professor of architectural engineering at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln who specializes in health-care design. Ryherd is not involved in Schlesinger's project.

More research will need to be done on how well the earbuds work, how patients respond to them and how comfortable they are to wear long-term, Ryherd added.

""My concern is that we just don't forget about the other things that are problematic,"" she said.

An earbud, she said, wouldn't change the source of the sound or how hospitals are designed. For example, hospitals often have hard, resonant floors that echo and propagate noise. To combat this, some have incorporated new materials into walls and ceiling tiles that can dampen sound but that are still hygienic and cleanable, Ryherd said.

""Hospitals do seem to be getting noisier as time goes on,"" she added, but alarms are hardly the only noise around. Between the bustle of people, carts rolling down the hallway and even the occasional helicopter, there's a lot going on in a dense space.

But medical devices do have certain acoustic features -- like their pitch, loudness and repetitiveness, she said -- that make them stand out from the din in order to alert doctors and nurses when something is amiss.

Louder noise in the hospital may have led to an arms race of even louder alarms, all clamoring to be heard over each other. Some researchers call this an ""acoustic feedback loop.""

The problem, Schelsinger said, is that many alarms are useless.

In one study of a single intensive care unit, for example, only 15% of alarms were considered ""clinically relevant."" About 40% were just plain wrong. Some of these noises only end up alarming the patients, Schlesinger said; doctors may know which noises require them to spring into action, but patients may think they're being ignored.

The end result, Schlesinger said, is that noisy, restless nights in the hospital can be disorienting for patients. This may especially be the case in the intensive care unit (ICU), where some of the most serious patients are monitored but which also happens to be one of the louder places in the hospital, he said.

The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services asks about nighttime quietness on its patient satisfaction survey . This may give hospitals a financial incentive to turn down the volume, as survey scores are tied to reimbursements.

""You can't take away patient monitoring -- that's critical -- but it's not really working for the patients,"" Ryherd said. ""I can't think of too many people I've talked to that have enjoyed the sound environment of the hospital."""

She later said they were talking about different sanctions

Washington (CNN) White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday President Donald Trump did discuss sanctions related to Russian election meddling when he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week, directly contradicting what the President said a day earlier.

""I do know that it was mentioned, specifically,"" Sanders said at an off-camera briefing with reporters. ""There were sanctions specific to election meddling that I believe were discussed, but not beyond that.""

Asked if Trump's view of sanctions against Russia changed after he met with Putin, Sanders said, ""Not that I am aware of.""

Her statement contradicts what Trump tweeted the day before, when he said sanctions were not discussed during his two-hour meeting with Putin at the G20 summit in Germany Friday.

""Sanctions were not discussed at my meeting with President Putin. Nothing will be done until the Ukrainian & Syrian problems are solved!""

The BSI agency said officials investigating the new scam had secured a list of 5,000 potential targets, and were notifying those individuals.  Organized criminals were using information they gleaned from social media networks, public company websites, job sites and even calls to the companies to fake the contact information for chief executives and other top executives. BSI said the Federal Criminal Police Office estimated that the scam had already cost firms millions of euros in recent months. The scam targets personnel in the accounting and auditing departments of a company who were authorized to transfer funds, often using time pressure and warnings about an alleged ""secret project"" to manipulate them to carry out the bogus orders. BSI President Arne Schoenbohm urged companies who had fallen prey to the scam to cancel the transactions and notify police. He also urged companies to warn all those authorized to carry out financial transactions about the scam. BSI did not identify affected companies.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-07/parq-vancouver-preview-bringing-vegas-flair-to-a-business-hotel,COULD THIS BE NORTH AMERICAS MOST FUN BUSINESS HOTEL?,"In Las Vegas, life revolves around casinos. If you eat at an elite restaurant, you will walk by a seemingly endless string of slot machines before you sit down at a white, cloth-covered table. The same is true whether you're a business travelers or a clubgoer; chances are, you're spending your days and nights indoors.Vancouver, on the other hand, is known for its vibrant outdoor lifestyle. Boats and bicycles are standard modes of transportation. Most of the citys most popular destinations, such as Stanley Park and Capilano Suspension Bridge, are outdoor spectacles.Thats why, on the face of it, Parq Vancouver seems an unlikely proposition. The $490 million project (C$643 million) is the brainchild of Paragon Gaming Holding Co., a privately held company that owns the Hard Rock in Lake Tahoe and has overseen the expansion of such quintessential Vegas properties as Excalibur and Luxor. Vancouver, meanwhile, has a small gaming footprint: When Paragon proposed a major casino in downtown Vancouver in 2010, not far from its existing Edgewater Casino, the plan was shot downthanks, in part, to a group appropriately called Vancouver Not Vegasand provoked a moratorium on casino growth. Which brings us to Parq, in downtown Vancouver.  It is the largest private development in British Columbia, a 775,000-square-foot property boasting 517 hotel rooms and eight restaurant and bars (more on all that in a minute), as well as 600 slot machines, 75 gaming tables, and a high-limit gaming floor with 11 luxury private salons.  The property wont be a Vegas-styled casino. Its part of the wave of big, new, business traveler-friendly hotels such as the Ned in London, with plenty of top-quality dining options. Parq boasts 60,000 square feet of meeting space, with outdoor terraces, city views, meeting pods outfitted with residential furniture, and Vancouver's largest hotel ballroom on its fourth floor. The sixth floor is dedicated to a 30,000-square-foot open air park, dotted with hundreds of local pine trees in a nod to the citys love of nature. The second floor has an entrance that leads directly to the neighboring BC Place stadium, at which U2 recently kicked off the Joshua Tree tour. Its the first casino in British Columbia with natural light streaming in.Scott Menke, chief executive officer of Paragon, claims he didnt choose Vancouver as a surrogate Vegas. The more time that we spent in the marketplace and saw the diversity and the depthand learned what Vancouver is all aboutI really think that its the best location in North America right now,"" he said. ""The revenues in Vancouver have grown consistently within the past 10 years; pretty much every other market has not seen a raise in table revenues. In fact, the city is well-positioned for business growth. By the end of July, the number of nonstop flights between Vancouver and China will have increased by almost 24 percent in six months; in the next 18 months, it will increase by 46 percent, according to Business Vancouver.Parq, which is scheduled to open in Vancouver in the fallif all goes according to plan, the opening will correspond with a Sept. 29 Coldplay concert at BC Placeis a collaboration with Marriot International Inc., which has two separate concepts in the space. One is JW Marriott, with 329 rooms that include 48 suitesthree offering private outdoor entertainment spaces and going for $10,000 a night in peak season. The second is the Douglas, a boutique-styled Autograph Collection hotel, which has 188 rooms and suites. Another thing that makes Parq more Vancouver than Vegas is something as simple as elevators that take guests straight to their rooms, restaurant, and/or meetings, with no casino walkabouts. And then there are the restaurants, conceived by the James Beard-nominated, Las Vegas-based restaurateurs Elizabeth Blau and Kim Canteenwalla. The most notable is 1886, a palace of Chinese specialties. We want to create one of the destination Chinese restaurants in North America, said Blau over email. (At Wynn Las Vegas, Blau helped create Wing Lei, the first Michelin-starred Chinese restaurant in the U.S.) While there are a small handful of fine dining Chinese restaurants, most focus on Cantonese or Shanghainese specialties. We want to celebrate lesser known regions, especially in Northern China. Blau is bringing in specialty chefs to run the dim sum and noodle programs. Because live seafood is key to upscale Chinese cooking, a large saltwater tank will showcase British Columbia species, as well as international fish and shellfish. High-limit rollers will be able to order to private salons and tables 24/7.On the more casual side is Mrkt East, Parqs answer to a Vegas-styled buffet, inspired by Blau and Canteenwallas travels around Southeast Asia. The horseshoe-shaped, hawker-styled market, designed by Vincent Celano of Celano Design, will be lined with booths specializing in tandoor-cooked meats and breads, curry bowls, and all kinds of dim sum. As an urban resort that is focused on the community, we didnt feel that a buffet or a food court really made sense, observed Blau. More locally focused is BC Kitchen, which will specialize in Canadian comfort food: Look for plenty of poutine and burgers, as well as a wide variety of craft beers, with bottles and cans from all over the country. (Blau hopes this will become an all-important spot before and after Vancouver Canucks hockey games.)Among the people rooting for Parq are Dave Gazley, a vice president at Tourism Vancouver. He noted the need for it: Vancouver has not seen major hotel development since the 2010 Olympics, in spite of unprecedented tourism growth over the past few years. More than 10 million people visited the city in 2016, the highest in its history. ""We don't have enough hotel rooms in Vancouver at the moment,"" said Gazley. ""Especially in the summer."""
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-g20-germany-putin-trump-idUSKBN19T0R9,PUTIN SAYS TRUMP WAS 'SATISFIED' WITH HIS ELECTION MEDDLING DENIALS,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday he thought his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump had been satisfied with his assertions that Russia had not meddled in the U.S. presidential election. Speaking at the end of a G20 summit in Germany where the two leaders met face-to-face for the first time, Putin said he believed he had been able to establish a personal relationship with Trump, and that the initial groundwork had been laid for an improvement in U.S.-Russian ties. Their meeting, on the sidelines of the Hamburg summit, was subject to intense scrutiny, following allegations that Moscow had tried to help Trump win the White House, and a Washington investigation into the Russia ties of Trump associates. Putin was pressed by reporters at a news conference to share details of the discussion he had with Trump about alleged Russian election interference. Russia has denied trying to influence the U.S. election. ""(Trump) asked a lot of questions on this subject. I, in as much as I was able, answered these questions. It seems to me that he took these (answers) on board and agreed with them, but in actual fact, it's best to ask him how he views this,"" Putin told one reporter. Pressed again later in the same news conference by reporters about what precisely Trump had told him, Putin said: ""He started to ask pointed questions, he was really interested in particular details. I, as much as I could, answered him in a fairly detailed way. ""I believe it would not be entirely appropriate on my part to disclose details of my discussion with Mr Trump. He asked, I answered him. He asked pointed questions, I answered them. It seemed to me that he was satisfied with those answers,"" Putin said. Putin also spoke warmly of Trump's personal qualities. The two men have spoken by telephone since Trump won the U.S. presidential election last year, but had not met until the G20 summit in Hamburg. ""I believe that we have established personal relations already,"" Putin told a news conference. ""The TV Trump is very different from the person in reality. He is absolutely precise, he reacts as you would expect to his interlocutor, he analyses fairly quickly, answers questions that are put to him. ""It seems to me that if we build our relations the way that our conversation went yesterday, then we all have grounds to believe that we can, at least in part, restore the level of cooperation that we need,"" Putin said. He said in particular that the Trump administration was taking a more pragmatic stance on the conflict on Syria. A ceasefire deal for southern Syria that was announced during the summit was the result of that new approach, Putin said, and represented a ""breakthrough.""

http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/05/news/economy/mexico-china-trade-deal/index.html,"SPURNED BY TRUMP, CHINA AND MEXICO TALK ABOUT A TRADE DEAL","President Trump threatened to slap tariffs on China and Mexico during his campaign. Now the two nations could team up for their own trade deal.

China's ambassador to Mexico, Qiu Xiaoqi, emphasized that China is ready to talk to Mexico about a ""free trade agreement.""

""There is no difficulty from China's side,"" Qiu said last week. ""We have great interest in deepening and broadening these ties.""

Trump is set to meet with President Enrique PeÃÂ±a Nieto this week at the G20 Summit in Germany. It will be their first meeting since Trump took office. Trump will also sit down with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Trump's meeting with PeÃÂ±a Nieto is critical for the United States and Mexico: PeÃÂ±a Nieto was supposed to meet Trump in Washington in January. Then Trump tweeted that he should only come if Mexico would pay for the border wall. PeÃÂ±a Nieto canceled his trip and emphasized that Mexico wouldn't pay for the wall.

Related: U.S. and Mexico dodge trade war over sugar

Along with Canada, Mexico and the United States will start renegotiating NAFTA, the free trade agreement between the three nations, in late August.

Trump has threatened to withdraw from NAFTA, and he frequently labels it a terrible deal. Trump blames Mexico and NAFTA for the sharp decline in American manufacturing jobs.

Mexico, meanwhile, is looking elsewhere for new economic alliances. And China say it's game.

Mexico's economic secretary, Ildefonso Guajardo, plans to visit China in September.

But it's not clear how much genuine interest there is in a trade deal, or if the parties are just posturing.

""It is to a certain degree political maneuvering ... to try to establish a united front against the U.S.,"" says Edward Glossop, an economist at Capital Economics, a research firm. ""The economics don't make massive sense, it's not an obvious deal.""

Related: Mexican peso fully recovers from Trump plunge

China is a giant market, but experts say it's unlikely China would become a major buyer of Mexican goods because of the great distance between the two countries and the availability of cheaper rivers in southeast Asia.

Like the United States, Mexico has lost lots of manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, and Mexico was forced to lower tariffs on imported goods from China.

A trade deal that would further cut tariffs on Chinese goods could risk more Mexican manufacturing jobs. That would be a tough sell at home for Mexican leaders.

Although China-Mexico trade ties have grown significantly, up to $43 billion last year, it's much smaller than the $580 billion in trade between the United States and Mexico.

But as long as the fate of U.S.-Mexico relations remains uncertain, the trade chatter with China reinforces Mexico's message to Trump: We're looking elsewhere.

For example, Mexico is accelerating trade talks with the European Union to update an agreement. Both sides hope to finish talks by the end of this year. Mexican officials also want stronger ties to Argentina and Brazil. Those two nations produce two big products -- corn and soy -- that Mexico mostly buys from the United States

""It sends a signal that we have a lot of alternatives,"" Guajardo said in May about the China trip.

Mexico's economic ministry did not respond to a request for comment on Xiu's remarks.

http://cnn.com/2017/07/10/politics/voting-panel-trump-tweets/index.html,LAWSUITS CITE TRUMP TWEETS TO CHALLENGE VOTING PANEL,"Washington (CNN) Opponents of President Donald Trump's voting integrity commission are seeking to hamstring the effort in court, filing three lawsuits Monday that say the panel is running afoul of federal laws -- and introducing Trump's heated rhetoric against him in court.

The new lawsuits add to the legal challenges against the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, which recently sent a letter to all 50 states that included a request for voter roll information, including parts of Social Security numbers, that alarmed states and voters. The letter asked for all ""publicly available"" data, but the long list of pieces of information sought, including the last four digits of Social Security numbers, included several elements that very few states, if any, say they can legally comply with.

One lawsuit targets on the request for voter information as a violation of privacy, while the other two focus more generally on whether the commission has been violating government transparency laws.

Just as with the lawsuits against Trump's travel bans, the challengers are using Trump's own words and tweets to fight his administration's actions, saying the commission was created to back up a spurious theory in the first place -- that voter fraud is a massive problem in the US.

""President Trump has a long history of propagating baseless conspiracy theories about voter fraud, ostensibly in order to suppress the right to vote,"" states a lawsuit from the ACLU of Florida and voters filed in a Florida federal court.

The lawsuits join an ongoing privacy case filed by advocates that sought to stop the commission's effort to collect information on voters all across America.

That litigation has prompted the office of Vice President Mike Pence -- who chairs the commission -- to email secretaries of state on Monday asking them to hold off transmitting any voter data pending the resolution of that case, according to a copy of the email obtained by CNN.

The White House is also changing its plans for how to house the information in response to the complaint, according to a new court filing submitted Monday.

Pence's office did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuits.

Using Trump's campaign speeches, tweets against him

While technical challenges to the law hinge on obscure federal codes like the Federal Advisory Committee Act and E-Government Act, the Florida complaint dedicates an entire section to Trump's repeated statements about rampant voter fraud -- statements that have been repeatedly debunked.

The lawsuit seeks to ""prevent the unauthorized collection of state voter information data"" and to prohibit the Florida secretary of state from providing the information. Lawyers for the ACLU argue that it infringes on voters' First Amendment rights and constitutes and ""unjustified invasion"" of privacy in violation of federal law.

The complaint cites a string of comments from Trump as a candidate and as President.

On October 17, 2016, lawyers cite Trump as saying: ""They say there's nothing going on. People that have died 10 years ago are still voting. Illegal immigrants are voting. I mean, where are the street smarts of some of these politicians? ... So many cities are corrupt, and voter fraud is very, very common.""

And after the election, on November 27, 2016, Trump said, ""In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.""

He later tweeted , ""I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and....even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!""

The White House has never offered evidence that illegal votes were cast in 2016 -- instead creating the commission and pointing to studies that found general irregularities on voting rolls. Studies have repeatedly shown that voter fraud is exceedingly rare in the US, tending to be isolated cases and usually mistakes.

The commission has a handful of Democratic members, some of whom have said they hope the group will also look at interference in the election by Russia.

Violating transparency rules?

The national ACLU on Monday also filed a lawsuit alleging the commission violated federal transparency laws by holding an organizing call that was not public, after which Kobach sent the controversial letter.

The commission provided a read-out of that call from the vice president's office, and have a meeting scheduled July 19 that will be livestreamed for the public. But the ACLU, which has been critical of the White House on the issue, says that's not enough.

""The commission held its first meeting without notice or making it open to the public,"" said ACLU staff attorney Theresa Lee. ""This process is cloaked in secrecy, raising serious concerns about its credibility and intent. What are they trying to hide?""

A similar lawsuit was also filed Monday by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Both lawsuits, filed in Washington, DC, district court, argue the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which mandates levels of transparency for federal commissions, require more of the voting integrity group.

The new lawsuits Monday join a filing from the Electronic Privacy Information Center challenging the collection of voters' information and another from Lawyers' Committee arguing Kobach may have violated the Hatch Act by promoting his role in the commission in his gubernatorial campaign.

""These lawsuits shows how voting rights advocates are looking for creative legal arguments to undermine the commission's activities,"" said Josh A. Douglas, an election law expert at the University of Kentucky College of Law. ""It's remarkable considering that prior election law commissions, which were seen as truly bipartisan, never faced this kind of challenge to its authority or actions."""

""The last instance being the tragic events of the Egyptian Christians on their way to monastery for prayer that were targeted so brutally by terrorists.""

By chance or by strategy, Xi and his officials picked their way through unscathed. Beijing is ultra-sensitive about Xi's image and ensuring he gets the respect it sees as his due as leader of an emerging superpower, especially when traveling to Western countries where it cannot so tightly control the public narrative. Diplomatic sources in Beijing, speaking ahead of Xi's trip to the G20 gathering in the German city of Hamburg, said Chinese officials had in private expressed nervousness that he could be asked awkward questions about North Korea, or the cancer-struck Liu, jailed for 11 years in 2009 for ""inciting subversion of state power"". In the end it was U.S. President Donald Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, amid accusations Russia interfered in the U.S. election, and Trump's refusal to return to the Paris climate agreement that dominated the limelight. Xi, by contrast, avoided controversy in his bilateral meetings and reaffirmed China's commitment to the Paris deal and to an open global economy, in what the official China Daily called the ""burnishing of (his) reputation"". ""Nobody talked about the South China Sea. No one talked about trade. Everyone was happy with Xi. I think he played this well,"" said Ulrich Speck, senior fellow at the Elcano Royal Institute in Brussels.     ""All eyes were on Trump and Putin. But the fact that there was no U.S.-China clash was at least as important. Xi stayed out of the alpha-male fight. China presented itself as a partner to Europe."" Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Xi ""made it clear that the G20 should adhere to taking the path of open development and mutual benefit leading to all-win results, support a multilateral trade mechanism, and promote international trade and investment"". ""China was in a good place at G20, with reasonable policies,"" said Jin Canrong of the School of International Studies at the Renmin University of China, who has advised the government on diplomatic matters. ""So President Xi was comfortable and positive there.""  Potentially the biggest test was Xi's meeting with Trump, who in the run-up to Hamburg had voiced frustration over China's inability to rein in its troublesome erstwhile ally, North Korea. In the event, Trump returned to the conciliatory tone struck at their first meeting in April, telling the Chinese leader it was ""an honor to have you as a friend"" and he appreciated actions Xi had already taken to try to dissuade North Korea from pursuing nuclear weapons. Influential Chinese state-run tabloid the Global Times said in an editorial on Monday that the Xi-Trump meeting had defied ""the naysayers in the West"". ""Beijing and Washington saw friction on issues including Taiwan and the South China Sea ahead of the meeting, and there was speculation from Western public opinion that the China-U.S. 'honeymoon' had come to an end. But the Xi-Trump meeting repudiates such speculation,"" the paper said. Speaking to reporters later on Air Force One, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the Trump-Xi meeting lasted more than an hour-and-a-half, and would have gone on longer had they not had to leave for other engagements. Ruan Zongze, a former Chinese diplomat now with the China Institute of International Studies, a think-tank affiliated with the Foreign Ministry, said Xi was much more upbeat than when he spoke to Trump a few days ahead of G20 and mentioned certain unnamed ""negative factors"" in their relationship. ""Even on trade Trump underscored that he wants cooperation,"" Ruan said. China's biggest concern had been U.S. policy toward self-ruled Taiwan, after the Trump administration approved a $1.42 billion arms package for Taiwan, claimed by China as its own. Neither government mentioned Taiwan in their respective accounts of their G20 meeting. Chinese officials were at pains to point out their good relations with the new administration in Washington. Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao told reporters in Hamburg that the Chinese and U.S. teams dealing the bilateral financial relationship clearly understood that both would be hurt by fighting with each other. ""Our strength is communicating every morning and every evening. This is unprecedented,"" Zhu said. On India, where China has over the past few weeks accused New Delhi of provocation by sending troops across the border in a disputed region, Xi avoided drama by not having a formal bilateral meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, though India's foreign ministry said they did speak. Even on Liu Xiaobo, Xi avoided being put on the spot, with China on Saturday allowing a U.S. and German doctor to meet him at his hospital in northeastern China.         Still, the faultlines remain in the tricky China-United States relationship. China may respond more assertively if, for example, more Chinese entities are sanctioned by the United States over North Korea or Trump raises barriers to Chinese goods as he has frequently threatened, said a senior Beijing-based Western diplomat. ""China has been restrained so far in reacting to Trump, but that is unlikely to last,"" said the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""Things are gearing up to be a summer of drama between China and the United States.""

http://cnn.com/2017/07/10/politics/trump-health-care-absent/index.html,TRUMP ABSENT IN FINAL HEALTH CARE SPRINT,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump has no plans to play a larger role in selling the Republican health care bill this week, an administration official told CNN Monday.

Though he often touts himself as the ultimate salesman with a knack for closing deals, he has remained tight-lipped and out of the spotlight, letting others make the last-minute push for health care reform for him.

There are no plans for Trump to travel the country to pitch the bill, the official said.

The President also has not visited Capitol Hill in hopes of cajoling dubious Republican senators who are wary to support the bill, like Vice President Mike Pence has. Instead, he's worked the phones, calling Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Dean Heller of Nevada before he headed to the G20 Summit in Germany.

He has also tweeted his encouragement.

""For years, even as a ""civilian,"" I listened as Republicans pushed the Repeal and Replace of ObamaCare. Now they finally have their chance!"" Trump tweeted Sunday.

For years, even as a ""civilian,"" I listened as Republicans pushed the Repeal and Replace of ObamaCare. Now they finally have their chance! Ã¢ÂÂ Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 9, 2017

Marc Short, Trump's legislative affairs director, said Monday that ""the President has remained very active in this debate, you will see him continue to remain so.""

But Short admitted during the off-camera briefing with reporters that ""it's a fair point"" to make that Democrats were more organized messengers for their health care bill than Republicans have been.

""There's more we could do to educate the public,"" he said.

By and large, Trump has steered clear of the tactics his predecessor used to garner support for his health care bill.

President Barack Obama was known for shedding his jacket and rolling up his sleeves as he pitched health care reform town halls. He held campaign-style rallies outside of shopping centers in Minneapolis and lead thousands in chants of ""Yes, we can.""

Obama even canceled a trip overseas just days before he was scheduled to depart because the House was expected to vote on health care in the coming days, and Democratic leaders were scrambling for votes.

With Trump not using presidential power to sell this bill -- especially with large scale events in key states -- the plan has little chance of rising from the depths of its low approval ratings. The Senate bill has just a 17% approval rating, according to a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll

""I think it comes down to the fact that he doesn't really care that much about health care,"" one Republican aide said of Trump. ""He just wants it done so he can fulfill that promise.""

""This will be great if we get it done and if we don't get it done it's going to be something that we're not going to like and that's OK and I can understand that,"" Trump recently told the senators gathered at the White House.

But it could be Trump's absence is the best move for those who hope for the legislation's passage.

The GOP aide told CNN that most senators would prefer for Trump to stay out of the health care negotiations.

""President Trump tends to complicate matters,"" the aide said. ""Honestly, I think they are happy he isn't publicly pushing for it.""

Pence, a former congressman, has been much more involved.

He shuttles back and forth to Capitol Hill for a luncheon with Senate Republicans almost every week, and in late June, he invited several of them who were undecided over to his private residence for dinner.

The vice president is scheduled to travel to Kentucky for a listening session with those who have been negatively impacted by the Affordable Care Act this Wednesday before heading to Providence, Rhode Island, Friday to deliver a speech his aides say will focus on health care at the National Governors Association summer meeting.

In an interview with radio host Laura Ingraham Monday, Pence made another public plea on the bill's behalf.

""This week is critical, and if you want to see Congress repeal and replace Obamacare, now is the time to let your voice be heard,"" Pence said.

Pence also made the pitch for the bill during a radio interview with Rush Limbaugh Monday.

""This is the moment,"" Pence said. ""Now is the time."""

Trump departed Germany earlier Saturday without taking questions from the press

Hamburg, Germany (CNN) Top advisers to President Donald Trump declined three times on Saturday to rebut claims from Russian officials that Trump had accepted their denials of alleged Russian interference in the US election.

Aboard Air Force One, chief economist Gary Cohn, national security adviser H.R. McMaster, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin all declined to knock down those remarks when pressed by reporters, deferring instead to Trump himself.

""President Trump will be happy to make statements himself about that,"" Mnuchin said. ""But President Trump handled himself brilliantly. It was very clear that he made his position felt, and after a very substantive dialogue on this, they agreed to move on to other discussions.""

A senior administration official who spoke to CNN on Friday evening said Trump did not accept Putin's denial of responsibility for the hacking.

Trump departed Germany earlier Saturday without taking questions from the press, unlike many of his counterparts. That included Russian President Vladimir Putin, who told reporters that Trump appeared to accept his assertion that Russia did not meddle in the US presidential contest.

About 2,000 users have been attacked so far, according to Kaspersky Lab analysts, with organizations in Russia and the Ukraine the most affected.Rob Wainwright, executive director at Europol, said the agency is ""urgently responding"" to reports of the new cyber attack. In a separate statement, Europol said its in talks with ""member states and key industry partners to establish the full nature of this attack at this time.""Kremlin-controlled Rosneft, Russias largest crude producer, said in a statement that it avoided serious consequences from the hacker attack by switching to a backup system for managing production processes.U.K. media company WPPs website is down, and employees have been told to turn off their computers and not use WiFi, according to a person familiar with the matter. Sea Containers, the London building that houses WPP and agencies including Ogilvy & Mather, has been shut down, another person said. IT systems in several WPP companies have been affected, the company said in emailed statement.With there being no global kill switch for this one, well continue to see the numbers rise in different parts of the world as more vulnerable systems become more exposed, said Beau Woods, deputy director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council in Washington. Most vulnerable are places where the operators are a lot of the times at the mercy of manufacturers and providers of those technologies and theres a long time between existence of a fix and implementation of a fix.The hack quickly spread from Russia and the Ukraine, through Europe and into the U.S. A.P. Moller-Maersk, operator of the worlds largest container line, said its customers cant use online booking tools and its internal systems are down. The attack is affecting multiple sites and units, which include a major port operator and an oil and gas producer, spokeswoman Concepcion Boo Arias said by phone.APM Terminals, owned by Maersk, is experiencing system issues at multiple terminals, including the Port of New York and New Jersey, the largest port on the U.S. East Coast, and Rotterdam in The Netherlands, Europes largest harbor. APM Terminals at the Port of New York and New Jersey will be closed for the rest of the day due to the extent of the system impact, the Port said.Cie de Saint-Gobain, a French manufacturer, said its systems had also been infected, though a spokeswoman declined to elaborate, and the French national railway system, the SNCF, was also affected, according to Le Parisien. Mondelez International Inc. said it was also experiencing a global IT outage and was looking into the cause. Merck & Co. Inc., based in Kenilworth, New Jersey, reported that its computer network was compromised due to the hack.Port operators at grain terminals in Rosario, Argentina also reported the attack affected operations, including halting some deliveries, beginning Tuesday morning, according to Guillermo Wade, manager of the Rosario port and maritime chamber.The strikes follow the global ransomware assault involving the WannaCry virus that affected hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries as extortionists demanded $300 in bitcoin from victims. Ransomware attacks have been soaring and the number of such incidents increased by 50 percent in 2016, according to Verizon Communications Inc. Analysts at Symantec Corp., have said the new virus, called Petya, uses an exploit called EternalBlue to spread, much like WannaCry. EternalBlue works on vulnerabilities in Microsoft Corp.s Windows operating system.The new virus has a fake Microsoft digital signature appended to it and the attack is spreading to many countries, Costin Raiu, director of the global research and analysis team at Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab, said on Twitter.The attack has hit Ukraine particularly hard. The intrusion is the biggest in Ukraines history, Anton Gerashchenko, an aide to the Interior Ministry, wrote on Facebook. The goal was the destabilization of the economic situation and in the civic consciousness of Ukraine, though it was disguised as an extortion attempt, he said.For more on cybersecurity, check out the Decrypted podcast: Kyivenergo, a Ukrainian utility, switched off all computers after the hack, while another power company, Ukrenergo, was also affected, though not seriously, the Interfax news service reported.Ukrainian delivery network Nova Poshta halted service to clients after its network was infected, the company said on Facebook.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-austria-cyber-idUSKBN19V20U,AUSTRIA DRAFTS LAW TO LET POLICE ACCESS MESSAGING DATA,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria is pursuing plans to give police authority to monitor messaging services such as WhatsApp (FB.O) and Skype in an attempt to ""close the gap"" on criminals who increasingly avoid communicating via telephone.   The government asked political, technology, civil rights and legal experts to review draft legislation that would give it authority to monitor real-time conversations using new messaging services and applications, Justice Ministry officials told Reuters on Monday. Such surveillance would be permitted only with a court order in investigations into terrorist activities or other crimes punishable by at least five years in prison, one of the officials said. Other European countries with similar laws include France, Italy, Poland and Spain, the ministry said. It was not immediately clear how Austria would conduct such surveillance, though one approach would be to install software on computers and mobile devices of suspects using messaging tools with end-to-end encryption that prevents the government from accessing it using traditional, remote eavesdropping techniques. Such tools are sold by a handful of firms that specialize in selling off-the-shelf surveillance tools, or spyware, to governments.  ""Law enforcement and intelligence agencies are gravitating toward this type of spyware to overcome the challenge of end-to-end encryption,"" said Ronald Deibert, director of the Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs in Toronto. Deibert, whose institute investigates abuse of such tools, said it is important for governments to make sure they have proper oversight and public accountability when giving authorities the right to use new surveillance technologies. Austrian courts have already sentenced several people to prison for links to terrorist organizations after verdicts that were supported by data acquired from seized devices. The proposed legislation provides authorization for obtaining data from devices that have not been seized. The government plans to submit the bill to parliament after an Aug. 21 deadline for submission of opinions. In Germany, police and intelligence services have authority to install malware on suspect phones, but this is highly controversial and it is unclear how widely it is used.  In the Netherlands, the Senate is scheduled to vote on Tuesday on digital security legislation with provisions to let intelligence services target criminal suspects with malware. Britain's Intelligence Act, which is still being implemented, explicitly gives power to police and intelligence services for the mass interception of communications.

Its unclear if any major business will be conducted -- hes just reached a major free trade agreement with the European Union -- but that doesnt make the two-day trip any less interesting.While in Stockholm, for instance, he may want to take a close look at how Sweden has successfully boosted short-term growth while also laying the groundwork for higher expansion rates in the future. The key is population growth.Sweden breached the landmark figure of 10 million inhabitants in January, with the total projected to reach 13 million in 2060, according to Statistics Sweden. Japans population, in contrast, is expected to drop. A young and growing population is key to maintaining a generous welfare state; the number of Swedes aged 65 and above will account for a quarter of the total population by 2060. In Swedens case, it has also helped boost growth via extra investments, for instance in housing.Swedens growth is fueled by two factors: Immigration (the country received one of the highest proportions of refugees per capita in Europe in 2015) and a birthrate thats one of the highest in the continent.One good way of boosting the birthrate in a mature economy is to empower women. On this front, the Nordics are the experts.Source: WEF, 2016That is one area where we would like to cooperate, on gender-equality issues and strengthening womens position in the labor market, Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven told reporters in Stockholm on Sunday. They need more people in the workforce to be able to handle the demographic situation.Abes stop in Helsinki would also be a good place from which to steal some ideas on how to reduce the gender gap: Finland ranks second in the World Economic Forums Global Gender Gap Index while Japan is closer to the bottom. Of Finland, the WEF says it has fully closed the gender gap on education and health and is the global runner-up in terms of political empowerment.While in Copenhagen, Abe may want to reflect on the fact that Denmark is stuck at sub-2 percent growth rates for the foreseeable future. Two reasons are being put forward for that: A slowdown in its pursuit of full gender equality and a tightening of immigration laws that has left the country short of skilled workers."

Rep. Ted Yoho said the meeting was opposition research

Washington (CNN) Republican Rep. Ted Yoho said it was appropriate for President Donald Trump's son to meet with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 campaign -- and added that he probably would have taken the meeting under the same circumstances.

""Do I think it's appropriate? I think I probably would have done the same thing,"" the Florida Freedom Caucus member said on ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer."" ""I mean, it's opposition research and, you know, anybody that's been in an election -- you're always looking to get the upper hand.""

Donald Trump Jr. acknowledged in a statement Sunday that he met with a Russian lawyer who he had been told ""might have information helpful to the campaign."" Trump Jr. issued the statement in response to The New York Times' reporting that he ""was promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton"" before agreeing to meet with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.

Veselnitskaya is a Russian lawyer who represents Russians who want to see an end to US sanctions against them -- sanctions that Russian President Vladimir Putin has also strongly opposed. She says she doesn't represent the Russian government and the Kremlin echoes that characterization.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/10/health/tobacco-movies-teen-smoking-study/index.html,TOBACCO USE JUMPS 80% IN TOP-GROSSING MOVIES,"(CNN) In 2016, 41% of top-grossing US movies showed people using tobacco, according to a recent report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , a decrease from the year before. However, there was an 80% increase in incidents of tobacco use in those movies from 2015 to 2016.

The numbers are prompting concern from public health researchers and advocates over the effects these scenes have on young people's behavior.

""We've known for a while that the more you see smoking on screen, the more likely you are to see youth smoking cigarettes in real life,"" said Michael Tynan, lead author of the report and a public health analyst at the CDC's Office on Smoking and Health. ""There's a causal relationship between the two.""

The data from the new report were taken from Thumbs Up! Thumbs Down! , a project of the nonprofit Breathe California of Sacramento-Emigrant Trails . Since 1991, the organization has collected data on tobacco use by counting the number of times a tobacco product is used or implied to be used in a movie scene.

The new report crunched the numbers from 2010 to 2016. The use of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, hookahs, smokeless tobacco and e-cigarettes was recorded in each of the top 10 highest-grossing movies at the US box office for each week of each year.

There was a steady decline in the amount of tobacco use shown in movies from 2005 to 2010. But in the next six years, the incidence fluctuated. It reached a peak in 2016, with 3,145 tobacco incidents in 143 movies.

Of 2016's youth-rated movies -- including G, PG and PG-13 ratings -- 26% featured tobacco incidents. Sixty-seven percent of R-rated movies in 2016 had tobacco incidents. Compared with 2010, the percentage of movies depicting the use of tobacco decreased slightly; the 2010 rates were 31% for youth-rated movies and 71% for R-rated.

Tobacco use was featured in 41% of the surveyed movies in 2016, down from 50% in 2015.

However, the number of tobacco incidents within movies actually increased by 72% from 2010 to 2016. And from 2015 to 2016, there was an 80% increase, from 1,743 incidents to 3,145.

""To me, this shows that the studios are capable of reducing the amount of smoking in films,"" said Stanton Glantz , one of the study authors and a tobacco control professor at the University of California, San Francisco. ""They went whole years without showing smoking in youth-rated movies, but they've stopped doing it.

""It was like they were getting the arsenic out of the popcorn,"" he joked, ""but they didn't finish the job.""

Tynan, Glantz and their colleagues noted limitations of the report: First, many movies were left out out of the analysis, though they noted that movies ranked in the top 10 usually account for 96% of all ticket sales.

Dan Romer , director of the Adolescent Communication Institute at the University of Pennsylvania, identified another limitation as those was watching the movie were unknown: Audiences could be filled with adults rather than youth.

""I don't want to downplay what they're saying. I think it's important to point out there's still a lot of smoking in movies,"" said Romer, who was not involved in the research. ""But it's hard to know from their study if it's the kind of movies that have a high viewership in adolescents.""

Also not accounted for were the numerous TV shows and made for TV movies that could also expose youths to tobacco and smoking.

Suggestions for improvement

The U.S. surgeon general released a report in 2012 directly illustrating a causal relationship between watching smoking in movies and youth starting to smoke.

In response to this, Glantz suggested measures that could be taken by the movie industry to better regulate tobacco depictions.

First, the Motion Picture Association of America , which assigns movie ratings, could give an R rating to any movie with smoking or tobacco use.

""The MPAA needs to modernize the rating system to reflect the conclusive science that putting smoking on a screen increases the chances of youth smoking and then dying prematurely as a result,"" he said.

Other recommendations include requiring film studios to certify that no payments have been received for using tobacco in movies. He also suggested that state and local governments could decline to give subsidies to films that portray tobacco.

The Motion Picture Association of America, the trade association representing six of the major Hollywood film studios, declined to comment on the new study.

'This person is a risk-taker'

Romer, who conducted a separate study that analyzed the incidence of tobacco use in movies from 1950 to 2006, found a decline over the time period he studied. He believes that this trend paralleled tobacco usage in everyday life through the years.

""The amount of smoking seen in the movies was remarkably consistent with the overall prevalence rates of smoking in the country,"" he said. ""Nowadays, there aren't as many people smoking anymore, so there's also less of that in the movies.""

What is it about smoking in the movies that makes children want to try it? Romer believes it's the ""edgy"" nature of movie characters.

""Hollywood now uses smoking as a cue to say that this person is a risk-taker and kind of an edgy character,"" he said. ""Not very normative and sort of on the fringe today. And so an adolescent that finds that appealing might say, 'I want to be like that person. I'm going to smoke.' ""

Craig Detweiler , a film historian and communication professor at Pepperdine University, said the ""coolness"" factor is hard for filmmakers to give up.

""There's so many iconic images of cool associated with smoking that it's a hard habit for actors and filmmakers to break,"" he said. ""The tension arises because filmmakers are often going for a particular look or feel. Smoke is very photogenic, and actors are always looking for something to do with their hands, a bit of business.""

He added, ""I think the challenge is for studio and filmmakers to put ethics ahead of aesthetics."""

http://cnn.com/2017/07/07/entertainment/kesha-praying/index.html,KESHA'S FRESH START,"(CNN) Is Kesha's new song going to be the fresh start she's been praying for?

Time will tell. But the singer is certainly hoping that's the case.

""I haven't slept in, like, I don't know how many days because I'm so excited and nervous,"" she said in an interview with The Zack Sang Show on Friday. ""I just feel like I'm on another planet.""

Kesha released ballad ""Praying"" on Thursday, her first new song in almost four years.

""Basically, there was a point where I didn't know if I was ever going to get to put out music again,"" she said, saying she's been crying ""happy tears"" for days. ""And here we are.""

The singer has been tied up in a long back-and-forth legal battle with producer Dr. Luke (real name Lukasz Gottwald), stemming from 2014 allegations that he drugged, emotionally abused and sexually assaulted her.

Gottwald has long denied those claims.

The legal proceedings for some time kept Kesha's career in a holding pattern.

Kesha's last album was 2012's ""Warrior.""

In fall 2015, Kesha and her attorney, Mark Geragos, attempted to secure a judge's permission to allow the singer to record with other labels and producers, stating in their petition that Kesha's career threatened to ""suffer irreparable harm"" due to her lack of new material. The move prompted the #FreeKesha movement on social media, with fans and advocates calling for the singer's release from her existing contract with Dr. Luke and his Kemosabe Records.

The effort failed, and Gottwald's lawyers asserted that the courts had already ""found that Kesha is already 'free' to record and release music without working with Dr. Luke as a producer if she doesn't want to,"" according to a statement at the time.

""Praying"" and the album from which it comes, ""Rainbow,"" are the first pieces of new material from Kesha since the legal dispute began.

""Rainbow"" is being released on Kemosabe Records/RCA Records.

Gottwald, who is no longer CEO of Kemosabe , is said to have had approval on the album, according to Gottwald's lawyer.

""There was no change in Kesha's contractual recording obligations -- she has not succeeded on any legal claim or motion to avoid them,"" attorney Christine Lepera told CNN in a statement Friday. ""Instead, she was always free to record and refused to. Now, as legally required all along, the album was released with Dr. Luke's approval by Kemosabe, which is a joint venture label of Dr. Luke and Sony.""

Dr. Luke has an ongoing defamation and breach of contract claim against Kesha in New York that Lepera said ""will be prosecuted fully.""

""Praying"" was produced and co-written by Ryan Lewis, of hip-hop duo Macklemore & Ryan Lewis.

Kesha, meanwhile, maintains that her single is a song into which she has ""channeled my feelings of severe hopelessness and depression.""

""It's from our darkest moments that we gain the most strength,"" she wrote in a published essay . ""There were so many days, months even, when I didn't want to get out of bed....I was never at peace, night or day. But I dragged myself out of bed and took my emotions to the studio and made art out of them.""

""Rainbow"" will be released on August 11."
http://cnn.com/2017/07/08/us/chicago-high-school-graduation-requirement/index.html,"CHICAGO'S NEW REQUIREMENT FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS: NO PLAN, NO DIPLOMA","(CNN) A product of Chicago's South Side, DeAvion Gillarm will be the first in his family to attend college.

""I always had a plan,"" said Gillarm, a Morgan Park High School graduate headed to Lincoln College next month. ""You're not going to be successful without a plan.""

Under a controversial new requirement, starting in 2020, students hoping to graduate from a public high school in Chicago must provide evidence they, too, have a plan for the future: either acceptance to college or a gap-year program, a trade apprenticeship, military enlistment or a job offer.

""It will help students think about what they want to do next in life,"" said Gillarm, who wants to study exercise science in college.

But not everyone is sold on a plan that Mayor Rahm Emanuel said will steer every graduating senior in the nation's third-largest school system on ""a path toward a successful life.""

Chicago Republican Party chairman Chris Cleveland, the parent of a public school student, said the Democratic mayor should instead focus on reducing a public high school dropout rate of nearly 30%. He questioned how the cash-strapped school system will pay for additional guidance counselors to help students develop post-secondary plans.

""How can they deny a high school kid a diploma he or she has earned?"" Cleveland asked. ""It's all well and good that they're asking kids to think about their futures, but denying a kid a diploma because they didn't get into college or get a job is absurd.""

'A pre-K to college model'

The Chicago Board of Education approved the plan, known as "" Learn. Plan. Succeed ,"" in May. With 381,000 students, Chicago Public Schools would become the first large urban district to implement such a requirement, according to city officials.

Public high school graduation requirements currently include science courses and 40 hours of community service.

""Yes, it is a requirement, but we're going to support you to also ensure you have a post-high school educational plan,"" Emanuel said during a National Press Club event last month.

""The idea that you are going to actually have a post-high school educational plan and all of a sudden we're putting a burden on our kids' backs -- I guarantee you the kids in Chicago will be better prepared for the future than any other child. Every other school system today leaves it to chance.""

About 60% of district students have post-secondary plans when they graduate, Emanuel said.

""I cannot in good conscience as a mayor allow the other 40% to not have a plan that the economy will require of them later in life,"" he said. ""Will achieving this require more of us? Yes, of course. But as a parent I would never leave it to chance that my kids have a plan post-high school, and as mayor I refuse the notion that the future of any child in this city should be treated any differently.""

Despite a high school graduation rate of about 73%, the number of Chicago students going on to college has not been promising. An estimated 18% of ninth-graders graduate high school and go on to earn a bachelor's degree within 10 years of starting high school, according to a 2016 study by the University of Chicago's Consortium on School Research

""A K-12 model was relevant 10, 15, 20 years ago,"" Emanuel said in April when announcing the initiative. ""The city of Chicago is moving toward a pre-K to college model.""

'A good plan on paper'

The school system laid off nearly 500 teachers and more than 1,000 support staff in 2015, but Janice Jackson, chief education officer for the public schools, said the new initiative will not place additional strain on the workload of guidance counselors.

Chicago school offcial Janice Jackson says the plan won't place extra burdens on guidance counselors.

Still, the district and city officials are working to raise about $1 million to pay for eight additional college and career coaches.

""This requires a mind shift,"" Jackson said. ""We are shifting hearts and minds about what children in urban school districts can do.""

Jackson noted that the new requirement would be waived for students with ""extenuating circumstances.""

""The population here in Chicago is extremely diverse, and while many of our kids have struggles to overcome to be successful in school, we wanted to make sure we were taking those things into consideration,"" she said without elaborating.

But critics are not convinced.

Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis said the plan was poorly thought out and would place additional burdens on counselors.

""Sounds like a good plan on paper, but I also wonder what do kids know what they want to do at or accomplish at 17 years old,"" Lewis said.

""I can't imagine you do all the work you do to graduate that you get your diploma withheld from you."""
http://cnn.com/2017/07/09/opinions/mcconnell-health-care-opinion-zelizer/index.html,HOW GOP COULD MAKE HEALTH CARE DEAL WITH DEMOCRATS,"Julian Zelizer, a history and public affairs professor at Princeton University and a CNN political analyst, is the author of "" The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society ."" He's co-host of the ""Politics & Polls"" podcast. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell surprised the White House and many Republicans last week when he floated the idea that his party might end up working with Democrats if they fail to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.

McConnell's words sound like more of a threat than a promise, particularly to intransigent Republicans who might fear that a bipartisan bill would be far less palatable to them and to the GOP base.

But let's imagine there is something to McConnell's idea. What if he is able and willing to mobilize a coalition of Democrats and moderate Republicans such as Senator Susan Collins to fix the Affordable Care Act through subsidies and other reforms that stabilize the health insurance markets?

It has happened before.

Reagan and Social Security

One of President Ronald Reagan's biggest defeats early in his administration came on his proposal to cut Social Security benefits for early retirees. When he included this measure in his budget, congressional Democrats snapped to attention. Dejected after Reagan's 1980 victory over President Jimmy Carter, Democrats criticized Reagan for trying to slash the benefits that elderly Americans depended on.

But Reagan didn't back away forever. In 1982, Social Security was back on the agenda when experts warned that Franklin Delano Roosevelt's greatest legacy faced a massive budgetary imbalance in the near term that threatened the program. The government would be spending more on benefits every month than it was raising through payroll taxes.

Reagan, still stinging from his defeat, established a bipartisan commission to offer recommendations about how to fix the program. Reagan appointed Alan Greenspan to serve as the chairman of the 15-person commission. The panel, which had more Republicans than Democrats, reviewed every possible solution. Democrats like Claude Pepper of Florida warned that the commission was stacked with conservatives and would not produce anything that his side could accept.

And other Democrats warned that the commission would have trouble making recommendations that were acceptable to their party. After all, the GOP was the party of Reagan, who had repeatedly expressed his opposition to the basic structure of Social Security, as well as Medicare.

In the 1982 midterm elections that took place while the commission met, many House Democrats -- who picked up 26 seats -- ran on the saying that, ""It's not fair . . . It's Republican"" in reference to the Social Security plan and other conservative domestic policies. Democrats handed out bumper stickers that read, ""Save Social Security -- vote Democratic.""

The commission came back with a recommendation to put the program on sound footing. The report ""rejected proposals to make the Social Security program a voluntary one."" But there were concerns that partisan pressures would sink the commission's recommendations.

Greenspan's panel proposed increasing Social Security revenues by taxing a larger number of employees, accelerating tax rates, taxing some Social Security benefits, delaying cost of living adjustments and more. Reagan expressed his support for their recommendations, saying, ""Well, sometimes, even here in Washington, the cynics are wrong. Through compromise and cooperation, the members of the commission overcame their differences.""

Dole and Moynihan

Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole, the stalwart conservative from Kansas, had made a number of statements indicating his support for modest reforms to save the program, including an op-ed in The New York Times published on January 3.

Dole argued that ""Through a combination of relatively modest steps, including some acceleration of already scheduled taxes and some reduction in the rate of future benefit increases, the system can be saved."" He added that ""When it is, much of the credit, rightfully, will belong to this President and his party.""

JUST WATCHED Santorum: Trump needs to step up on health care Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Santorum: Trump needs to step up on health care 10:02

Democratic Senator Patrick Moynihan of New York, who was on the commission with Dole and had just been sworn in to a second term, was energized by Dole's op-ed. Moynihan approached Dole on the Senate floor and asked: ""Are we going to let this commission die without giving it one more try?"" The op-ed was crucial to Moynihan, who recalled that until that point Republicans ""were talking about scrapping the system.""

White House Chief of Staff James Baker organized a ""gang of five"" (also called the ""gang of nine"" for those who included the four White House staffers who participated) with members from both parties who entered into an intense, secretive set of meetings to find a resolution. Hardly ""anyone expected the negotiations to succeed,"" according to the Times given the intensity of partisan division.

Their meetings were conducted behind closed doors, leaving some to fear the kind of wheeling and dealing that was taking place. In his classic account of the reforms, ""Artful Work: The Politics of Social Security Reform,"" political scientist Paul Light wrote that the closed-door negotiations were essential to success so that members could make ""painful choices"" on key issues.

Other than a long break on January 8 to watch the Washington Redskins compete in the NFL playoffs, the negotiations were nonstop. In the end, both sides agreed that the final deal had to inflict some political pain on both parties -- that was the only way it could work. They reached a deal on January 15.

The administration found support from such congressional Democrats as Speaker Tip O'Neill who was eager to join the president in this effort to save a key part of the social safety net.

Congress eventually passed legislation that raised the payroll tax, raised the retirement age from 65 to 67, delayed the cost of living adjustment for six months and required government workers to pay for Social Security. The Social Security Amendments of 1983, a $168 billion package, remain a landmark moment in the history of the program. It made the program solvent for several more decades.

Reagan said the legislation ""demonstrates for all time our nation's ironclad commitment to Social Security."" He continued, ""It assures the elderly that America will always keep the promises made in troubled times a half a century ago. It assures those who are still working that they, too, have a pact with the future.""

The health care impasse

In 2017, repeating this success with health care seems almost inconceivable. The polarization in Washington has become so much worse that it is hard to imagine the two parties coming together on any issue of this significance.

House Republicans who are part of the Freedom Caucus and their allies in the Senate will have little appetite to join Democrats on any initiative. Shifting to the center feels to them like the ultimate act of political betrayal. Any Republican willing to sign on to such a deal would face great political risks back home. Repealing Obamacare has been so important symbolically that compromising on this question could be politically disastrous for Republican members of Congress.

JUST WATCHED Collins still a 'no' on GOP health care bill Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Collins still a 'no' on GOP health care bill 00:53

Democrats will likewise have little appetite to hand President Trump a victory of this sort. The utter failure of Republicans to deliver on repealing the ACA, with the realization that much of the program is far more popular than conservatives believed it to be, has been one of the main rallying points for the Democratic Party. Continuing to hammer away on this issue, rather than giving Republicans a victory, could be critical to success in the 2018 election, allowing them to both save the program and regain control of the House. So why compromise right now?

And both parties must grapple with the reality that millions of Americans who now have health coverage are likely facing rising costs.

Yet maybe the politics will move Washington in the most unexpected of directions. Perhaps McConnell will see that bipartisanship might in fact offer his party the best way to save itself on health care and to move on to more appetizing issues, such as cutting taxes for business and investors. This could be a legacy-making moment for him as a congressional leader, even if there are big short-term political costs.

What a deal could mean

For Trump, it could allow him to finally claim a domestic victory and give some credence to the notion that he is a maverick. Should he defy the conservative Republicans, he might come out of this with more leverage to move the party on other issues.

Democrats could break the lock that Tea Party Republicans have had on Capitol Hill since 2010 and create a precedent for other sorts of alliances, such as a deal on rebuilding infrastructure, that go against the conventional wisdom. Republicans who locked in march step with the conservative caucus would know that the possibility of bipartisanship was a real option.

Democrats face the real risk that if gridlock prevents Congress from fixing the program, the costs of premiums will continue to rise and more insurers will pull out of health care markets, leaving the party to shoulder the responsibility of these problems. Instead, through a deal, the Democrats could come out of this bruising battle with a new and improved ACA.

In entering this alliance, they could save a health care program that is central to their party's recent rule, and offer ongoing evidence -- in the midterms and the next presidential election -- of what they can accomplish when they are in power.

The President could immediately generate some good press coverage by creating a bipartisan commission to offer recommendations for fixing the ACA.

The odds of any of this happening are slim. Intense partisan polarization is not some imaginary force in national politics -- it defines our era.

Yet every now and then, as the nation saw in 1983, both parties can find a way to join hands with the opposition in ways that benefit both of their interests and help citizens achieve more security in their lives."

On Monday, Trump named Randal Quarles, a former top Treasury Department official in the George W. Bush administration, as his choice for the Federal Reserve's vice chair for supervision post, filling one of three vacancies on the board. The president's nomination will require Senate confirmation.

Quarles is the first person to fill the role, which was created under the 2010 Dodd-Frank reform law to oversee the country's largest U.S. banks. Former President Barack Obama never nominated anyone for the job. Daniel Tarullo, the former Federal Reserve governor, who stepped down in April, served as the de facto vice chairman for supervision.

Jerome Powell has been serving as the head of the bank oversight committee since Tarullo left.

By filling the post, the Trump administration will now have an opportunity to reshape the postcrisis financial regulatory landscape. The president has repeatedly renewed his pledge to do a ""major elimination of the horrendous"" Dodd-Frank regulations.

Quarles has already signaled the need to take a second look at the reform law. ""There are ways to redefine Dodd-Frank and other forms of regulatory policy in ways that would be beneficial to the economy,"" Quarles told Bloomberg Television in a November 2015 interview.

Former colleagues of Quarles, many of whom who spoke on the condition of anonymity, describe him as a ""pragmatist, not an ideologue,"" who would take a careful approach in pursuing measures to ease the regulatory burden on Wall Street.

""He'd look at Dodd-Frank to see what works and what doesn't work,"" said Rodgin H. Cohen, a senior chairman of law firm Sullivan & Cromwell LLP. ""We're not going to be bound by slogan. We're going to be bound on getting the right results.""

Tony Fratto, a former official in the George W. Bush administration who advises on communications strategy for companies including Citigroup Inc. and General Electric, said Quarles would bring an objectivity to the role not having acted as one of the chief architects of Dodd-Frank or responsible for orchestrating the financial rescue.

""He has a very objective view on what was done during the crisis and what was done through Dodd-Frank and will apply it to the Fed's role without any prior bias,"" said Fratto.

Quarles, if confirmed, will play a different role overseeing bank supervision than Tarullo. Tarullo was nominated by President Barack Obama in January 2009 to serve as a primary responder in shaping postcrisis following the 2008 financial crisis. But from his new perch at the Fed, Quarles will be in a position to help steward a comprehensive review of existing regulations to find areas of improvement, rather than building it from scratch.

Before leaving his post earlier in April, Tarullo opened the door to possible changes to the reform law. He signaled out the so-called Volcker Rule, which bans the largest banks from taking risky bets with taxpayer money, as one area revisions could be made. That's at least one area of shared agreement with Quarles, who said the rule is ""not well designed.""

Still, Tarullo has urged his predecessor and Congress not to completely unwind the entirety of sweeping law aimed at preventing another financial crisis.

""Neither regulators nor legislators should agree to changes that would effectively weaken that regime, whether directly or indirectly,"" said Tarullo in a speech at Princeton University. ""It would be tragic if the lessons of the financial crisis were forgotten so quickly.""

Former colleagues said they expect he would work collaboratively with other governors and staff at the Fed given his prior experience in the government working on domestic and international finance issues. Quarles worked as undersecretary for domestic finance, serving as a liaison between Treasury and the financial industry between 2005 and 2006, and as an assistant Treasury secretary for international affairs from 2002 to 2005. He was also a Treasury official under President George H. W. Bush from 1991 to 1993.

Observers said he would not be the kind of person who would want to come in and turn everything upside down at the Fed. Rather, he would work collaboratively with staff in seeking regulations ripe to be pared back to stimulate economic growth -- a mantra of the Trump White House.

""His wish list will be shorter than other candidates,"" said the head of one Washington-based trade group, which represents some of the largest U.S. banks. ""He'll probably want a limited number of reforms than others who have been considered for the position, but he'll be better positioned to get the ones he want.""

Quarles has endorsed against ""arbitrarily taking an ax to big banks and irreparably damaging the economy,"" according to March 2016 editorial in the Wall Street Journal, co-written with Lawrence Goodman, president of the Center for Financial Stability. The two men also made the case against a ""dramatic increase in bank capital.""

He also worked with private equity firm Carlyle Group for a number of years. He would be the second of seven governors to be a veteran of the private-equity firm. Jerome Powell was a partner at the firm between 1997 and 2005.

Observers noted his private equity experience would bring fresh eyes to systemic risk issues by looking beyond the biggest banks."

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-mosul-idUSKBN19V105?il=0,IRAQI PM DECLARES VICTORY OVER ISLAMIC STATE IN MOSUL,"MOSUL/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraq's prime minister declared victory over Islamic State in Mosul on Monday, three years after the militants seized the city and made it the stronghold of a ""caliphate"" they said would take over the world. ""I announce from here the end and the failure and the collapse of the terrorist state of falsehood and terrorism which the terrorist Daesh announced from Mosul,"" Haider al-Abadi said in a speech shown on state television, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. A 100,000-strong alliance of Iraqi government units, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Shi'ite militias launched the offensive to recapture the northern city from the militants in October, with key air and ground support from a U.S.-led coalition. Abadi, wearing a black military uniform and flanked by commanders from the security forces, thanked troops and the coalition. But he warned that more challenges lay ahead. ""We have another mission ahead of us, to create stability, to build and clear Daesh cells, and that requires an intelligence and security effort, and the unity which enabled us to fight Daesh,"" he said before raising an Iraqi flag. Iraq declared a week-long holiday to mark the victory. People celebrated in the streets of the capital Baghdad and southern cities. Abadi arrived in Mosul on Sunday to congratulate military commanders who have waged a nearly nine-month battle to recapture the city, many parts of which were reduced to rubble. Gunfire and explosions could be heard earlier in the day as the last few Islamic State positions were pounded. The coalition said in a statement Iraqi forces were in ""firm control"" of Mosul, but some areas still needed to be cleared of explosive devices and possible Islamic State fighters in hiding. Around the time of Abadi's announcement, Islamic State released a statement claiming to have mounted an attack on Iraqi forces in Mosul. Reuters could not immediately verify the report. Abadi had been meeting military and political officials in Mosul in an atmosphere of celebration that contrasts with the fear that spread after a few hundred Islamic State militants seized the city and the Iraqi army crumbled in July 2014. Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi shocked the Middle East and Western powers three years ago by appearing at the pulpit of Mosul's Grand al-Nuri Mosque to declare the caliphate and himself the leader of the world's Muslims. A reign of terror followed which eventually alienated even many of those Sunni Muslims who had supported the group as allies against Iraq's Shi'ite majority. Opponents of Islamic State were executed and such crimes as smoking a cigarette were punishable by public whipping. Since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, the Shi'ites have been politically dominant in Iraq but the country has been racked by ethnic conflict. (For a  graphic on destruction in Mosul, click tmsnrt.rs/2sV2emM) In the aftermath of victory in Mosul, Abadi's government  faces the task of managing the sectarian tensions there and elsewhere that enabled Islamic State to win support, and the threat of a wave of revenge violence in the city. The coalition warned that victory in Mosul did not mark the end of the group's global threat. ""Now it is time for all Iraqis to unite to ensure ISIS (Islamic State) is defeated across the rest of Iraq and that the conditions that led to the rise of ISIS in Iraq are not allowed to return again,"" Lt. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend said in a statement. U.S. President Donald Trump congratulated Iraq and said Islamic State's days were numbered. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called the victory ""a critical milestone"" in the war against Islamic State. Baghdadi has fled the city and his whereabouts are unknown. Reports have circulated that he is dead but Iraqi and Western officials say they cannot corroborate this.  His death or capture would not be the end of Islamic State, which still controls areas south and west of Mosul and which is now expected to take to the desert or mountains to wage an insurgency. The militants are likely to keep trying to launch attacks on the West and inspiring violence by ""lone wolves"" or small groups of the kind mounted recently in Britain, France and elsewhere. But the loss of Iraq's second-largest city is a grave body blow to Islamic State. Islamic State is also under heavy pressure in its operational headquarters in the Syrian city of Raqqa. But a concern shared by the United States and its coalition allies is that Iran could fill the vacuum left by the Sunni militants to expand in both Iraq and Syria. Qassem Soleimani, head of the Quds Force, the extraterritorial branch of Shi'ite Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said on Monday Iran had sent ""thousands of tonnes"" of arms and fighter jets to Iraq to help it fight Islamic State, Iranian media reported. The stench of corpses along Mosul's streets was a reminder of the gruelling urban warfare required to dislodge Islamic State. Much of the city of 1.5 million has been destroyed in the fighting, its centuries-old stone buildings flattened by air strikes and other explosions. One of Islamic State's last acts was to blow up the historic al-Nuri mosque and its famous leaning minaret. Thousands of people have been killed. The United Nations says 920,000 civilians have fled their homes since the military campaign began in October. Close to 700,000 people are still displaced. ""It's a relief to know that the military campaign in Mosul is ending. The fighting may be over, but the humanitarian crisis is not,"" said U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq Lise Grande.""Many of the people who have fled have lost everything. They need shelter, food, health care, water, sanitation and emergency kits. The levels of trauma we are seeing are some of the highest anywhere. What people have experienced is nearly unimaginable."" Iraqi soldiers relaxed. Some swam in the Tigris river which runs through the city. One wiped the sweat from his face with an Islamic State flag. Writing by Michael Georgy; Editing by Andrew Roche"

Africa's oldest ruler at 93, Mugabe was last in Singapore in May for what his spokesman George Charamba said then was treatment for eye problems. The Standard said he had left again for Singapore on Friday for more medical treatment. Information and Broadcasting Services Minister Chris Mushohwe told the newspaper Mugabe was in Singapore but declined to confirm the reason for the visit. The ruling ZANU-PF party said on Saturday it had cancelled a youth rally scheduled for July 14 due to be attended by the president because he would be out of the country. Charamba and Mushohwe did not respond to calls and messages to their phones for comment.  Despite growing concerns about his health, Mugabe has taken more than ten trips abroad this year and wants to seek another five-year term in office in 2018. He has ruled the southern African nation since independence from Britain in 1980. The government has denied he falls asleep in meetings, saying in response to television footage appearing to show him doing so that he is resting his eyes.  Mugabe has racked up more than 200,000 air miles since the start of 2016. He spent $53 million on foreign trips last year, more than double the initial budget of $23 million, according to government data. Reporting by MacDonald Dzirutwe; editing by John Stonestreet"
http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/10/opinions/afghanistan-war-should-be-visible-lemmon-opinion/index.html,THIS NEW PENTAGON POLICY MISSES AN IMPORTANT POINT,"Gayle Tzemach Lemmon is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. She is the author of ""Ashley's War: The Untold Story of a Team of Women Soldiers on the Special Ops Battlefield."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.

(CNN) The Afghan war may live far from the headlines, but US soldiers are not far from the battlefield.

A 19-year-old Army soldier, Pfc. Hansen Kirkpatrick, lost his life in Afghanistan due to "" indirect fire "" on July 3. His death marks the eighth loss this year for Americans serving in their nation's longest war.

In a Facebook post now taken down but reported on by local media , his mother, Anngel Norkist, urged people to remember the sacrifice of her son and his fellow soldiers still serving in Afghanistan. Norkist confirmed to me by telephone that the post was hers.

""Please seriously stop! Take a moment. Realize that real actual blood dropped on a battlefield for YOU. That's what the red symbolizes on our flag. My son just died today...over on some nasty, dry battlefield in a far off land. His life was cut short at only 19. Stop and really give thanks for all those who gave and continue to give us our freedoms we so easily take for freakin granted,"" Norkist wrote.

""Do not comment and say how sorry you are! I don't care!! Actions speak louder than words, so GO MAKE A DIFFERENCE!""

This sentiment underscores a hard reality: These losses should be our country's losses, and right now they don't feel like it. They feel quarantined, experienced by a grieving few instead of a nationwide many.

A fraction of the American population has fought 100% of its wars for 16 years. Precious few Americans are paying attention.

In the future, news about American battlefield losses may be even slower to reach the headlines. The Pentagon has announced a new policy stating that it will hold all information about US troop deaths until one day after notification of next-of-kin.

A spokesman for Army Gen. John Nicholson, who leads US and NATO forces in Afghanistan, said there are simply too few soldiers serving in Afghanistan now for ""non-identifying"" announcements of US deaths to remain anonymous -- especially in the age of social media.

""Gen. Nicholson is insistent that the support system for family members of our fallen and wounded warriors is in place with those families prior to public release; hence the 24-hour hold after next-of-kin notification,"" said Capt. William Salvin , a spokesman for the US led coalition in Afghanistan.

""Information that we have historically released that was considered 'non-identifying information' has become identifiable given that we have such a limited footprint in Afghanistan.""

While the motivation to hold back potentially identifiable information is understandable, the policy should not mean that the American public hears even less than they already do about lives lost in their name.

The reality is this policy shift will make little practical difference in a war in which most every casualty has become nameless and faceless for most of the nation. But as Kirkpatrick's mother so poignantly made clear, those names and faces should be known to Americans.

The war in Afghanistan, which began in October 2001, has become barely noticed background noise for most citizens, whose lives remain untouched in any direct way by the conflict. And the delay in notification may make the war even more remote.

As Gen. Nicholson knows better than nearly anyone, it is important for Americans to hear Ã¢ÂÂ quickly and in a timely manner Ã¢ÂÂ of the losses their nation's fighting forces are sustaining.

It is important for those newly Gold Star families to know that their country is there for them, that it cares, that it understands the sacrifice and appreciates that some families are willing to incur unfathomable losses on behalf of their country.

What would make the biggest difference for grieving families is for Americans to sit up and pay attention to their wars and to mourn with Gold Star families once those losses are named and faces and photos are added to the stories about war casualties. This is because war is deeply personal, even if we don't write, talk or act like it in this country.

Beyond the policy changes on notification, America's disconnection from the Afghanistan war is about to be tested further as the Pentagon-led interagency review of the conflict launched by President Donald Trump finally draws to completion Ã¢ÂÂ several months later than expected. Among the issues being debated by those conducting the policy review: the number of troops, what kinds of troops and for how long would they remain committed to the Afghan theater.

Those close to the review expected an announcement in May, before that month's NATO summit. Indeed, in February, Defense Secretary James Mattis told reporters that ""it shouldn't take too long. I've got to integrate a fair number of issues to give a good recommendation for the way ahead.""

Three months later, Mattis said that the Afghanistan troop recommendation ""is being put together by the chairman and myself, and I expect it'll go to (a) decision very, very soon."" And in June, the defense secretary told Congress that he would be giving Trump his Afghanistan recommendation ""very soon.""

Recent reports suggest that Trump, who had previously said he would defer to his generals about troop levels, would cap the number of those sent to Afghanistan at 3,900 Ã¢ÂÂ at least without requiring military leaders to return to him for his approval.

This was a month after news reports appeared , asserting that ""the Pentagon will send almost 4,000 additional American forces to Afghanistan"" and nearly immediately generated a statement from the Pentagon denying any decision had been made.

Whenever the official troop announcement comes, it likely will be around the 3,900 mark. America must pay closer attention as those service members deploy and engage with its wars not from a distance, but as if the war had personal stakes.

For the sake of families like those of Pfc. Hansen Kirkpatrick and for the sake of the country that sent him to Afghanistan in the first place, America can no longer see these fights as sterile, nameless or faceless.

They are none of the above. Every one of those losses was a father, mother, sister, wife, friend and brother. And each one should matter Ã¢ÂÂ in real time Ã¢ÂÂ to the nation."

The agency is also exploring whether pain-management training should be required for doctors as well as nurses, pharmacists or other health-care providers.America is simply awash in immediate-release opioid products, Gottlieb said at a speech in Silver Spring, Maryland, as part of a two-day public FDA meeting on painkiller abuse.Many people who become addicted to opioids will eventually move on to seek higher dose formulations of these drugs or illicit street drugs, which are increasingly the low-cost alternatives, Gottlieb said.Gottlieb said the FDA also plans to survey doctors to make sure the term abuse deterrent isnt giving a false sense of security that the painkillers are less likely to lead to addiction than pills without the designation. Abuse-deterrent versions of the pain pills are formulated to be harder to crush, snort or inject for a more potent high.We dont want to improperly convey a perception that a product thats resistant to manipulation and abuse is somehow also less prone to fueling addiction when thats simply not true, Gottlieb said.The agency has already acted on related concerns under Gottlieb. Last week, Endo International Plc said it would halt U.S. sales of its powerful opioid painkiller Opana ER, after the FDA said the abuse-deterrent version of the drug had been tied to an outbreak of HIV and hepatitis C after users would inject it and share dirty needles.Most of the opioids the FDA approves with abuse-deterrent features are extended-release versions. The regulator previously had criticized Endos abuse-deterrent technology and didnt grant it the ability to claim abuse deterrence on the label.The prescriber education the FDA intends to require for fast-acting opioids would help health-care providers better understand which patients are best suited for the drugs. The FDA recently proposed updating its blueprint for pain management education to include non-medication-based therapies including physical therapy, surgery and acupuncture. The FDA already requires prescriber education for extended-release opioids.The FDA has said it will be examining whether it should take action to reduce the number of 30-day prescriptions that are written for pain related to conditions such as dental procedures that dont require a whole months supply."

Police said Wednesday that Eric Robert Begley, a.k.a. Ã¢ÂÂDeuce,Ã¢ÂÂ had been charged with two counts of first degree murder in the deaths of 75-year-old Allene and 79-year-old Cleve McMahan.

Police said the McMahans were killed in their home on Rockhill Place on December 11, 1989.

Begley, 42, is in custody in Indiana and Asheville police are working to have him extradited to North Carolina.

Police said cold case investigators Detective Kevin Taylor and Detective Steve Coon made a break in the case after a recent interview. They do not believe Begley acted alone and the investigation continues.

Sgt. Charles Wells of the Asheville Police Department shared more details about Bergley with FOX during an interview on Wednesday.

""Mr. Begley actually did 20 years, I believe, in Indiana for charges that occurred out there,"" Wells explained. ""He recently got out of jail and was re-arrested for a minor drug charge and requested to speak to us, so we went up to interview him while he was in Indiana.""

Begley was only 14-years-old in 1989 when the homicide occurred, and Wells said police know he didn't act alone.

""We believe other people are involved, that's the open part of the investigation,"" said Wells. ""We're asking anyone that may be familiar with the case that may have information to identify others involved.""

Anyone with any information about the crime is asked to contact the Asheville Police Department at 828-252-1110 or Crime Stoppers at 828-255-5050.

Elliott, the largest creditor to Oncors bankrupt parent, Energy Future Holdings Corp., is pushing the Texas utility to allow for alternate proposals with better valuations.Elliott published some documents together with the letter, which was sent to Energy Future just days before Berkshire Hathaway announced its Oncor deal. The hedge fund also urged the utilitys board to immediately bring Elliott into its negotiations regarding any alternatives, including talks on the deal with Berkshire to avoid unnecessary litigation costs and expenses and to help with confirmation of a plan of reorganization upon which an alternative transaction rests.While we are entirely supportive of a transaction with Berkshire or another third party in the event that the value provided by that transaction exceeds the value being proposed by Elliott, we fear that the Berkshire transaction does not provide such value, Elliott said in its letter.The energy unit of Berkshire Hathaway on Friday became the third company to try to buy Oncor, a takeover thats key to ending the bankruptcy of Energy Future, which began in April 2014. Earlier this year, Texas regulators rejected NextEra Energy Inc.s $18.4 billion bid to buy Oncor for a third time. Last year, it quashed an offer from Hunt Consolidated Inc.Elliott values Oncor at approximately $18.5 billion and the reorganized parent entity at $9.3 billion, according to the letter. Berkshire announced July 7 that it would buy Oncor in a deal said to be valued at about $17.5 billion."

It's located on the second level of the Eiffel Tower

Washington (CNN) The invitation from French President Emmanuel Macron to President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump to join him in Paris for that city's annual Bastille Day festivities later this week was a signal to the hopefulness of a lasting friendship. The addition of dinner at the city's famed Le Jules Verne restaurant was a signal that he really means it.

According to French magazine, Paris Match , Macron will host the Trumps and their delegation for dinner on Thursday night at the decadent restaurant, which is located on the second level of the Eiffel Tower and boasts an insane view of the City of Lights. You get there via private elevator.

There is buzz that the meal , likely helmed by Le Jules Verne's award-winning chef, Alain Ducasse, could feature blue lobster and caviar, staples on the six-course, $260 prix fixe menu offered by the restaurant. (Blue lobsters, by the way, are essentially like East Coast American lobsters, only they're blue until cooked, and then their shells turn red.)

The restaurant and the White House did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment on the dinner.

In 2015, President Barack Obama was also feted at a fancy French restaurant, by then-French President FranÃÂ§ois Hollande -- the group dined at the Michelin three-starred eatery, L'Ambroisie.

Militants regularly attack oil facilities to press their demands for a greater share of the revenue that Africas biggest crude producer earns from the fuel. In recent years, Shell, Total SA, Chevron Corp. and Eni SpA have divested from onshore assets in the West African nation to focus more on offshore production.Neconde denied any deal existed with the communities and said it had met all its obligations. The company owns 45 percent of the block, called Oil Mining Lease 42, while NNPC holds the rest. It produces 10,000 barrels of crude a day, according to Necondes website.There was no five percent agreement consummated with the host communities as Shell sold its equity shares and we bought them, Chief Operating Officer Olajide Ishola told reporters in Warri on Friday. We will engage the communities, discuss and reach a compromise.Neconde has until late July to address the demands, the Gbaramatu communities said."
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-steel-eu-demand-idUSKBN19V1G1,"EUROFER UPS EU STEEL DEMAND FORECAST, WARNS ON 'DISASTROUS' U.S. TARIFF PLAN","LONDON (Reuters) - European steel association Eurofer raised its 2017 EU steel demand forecast on Monday but said isolationist measures such as a U.S. plan to levy steel tariffs on national security grounds could be disastrous for global trade flows. Eurofer said apparent EU steel demand, which includes inventory changes, will rise 1.9 percent this year to 159 million tonnes. It previously forecast demand, seen as a gauge of regional economic health, would rise 1.3 percent in 2017. Despite the raised forecast, the association issued its starkest warning yet about potential import distortions, saying regions mills could again fail to benefit from demand growth and instead lose market share to imports.  ""With no structural solutions for the underlying problem of global overcapacity in sight, the number of protectionist and even isolationist measures look set to increase,"" Eurofer  director general Axel Eggert said in a statement.  ""In particular, measures potentially stemming from the U.S. section 232 investigation may lead to a proliferation of disastrous global trade flow distortions."" The United States launched a ""section 232"" probe in April into whether imports of steel, the second biggest industry in the world after oil and gas, posed a risk to national security.  Though the move is aimed primarily at top global steel producer China, Eurofer fears EU countries will bear the brunt of the measures because Chinese steel is already largely subject to U.S. restrictions. It is also concerned that steel headed for U.S. shores will be re-routed to the EU. Invoking national security in peacetime is seen by trade experts as a move that risks undermining the global rules-based trading system by sparking retaliatory action around the world in products beyond steel. At a weekend summit in Germany, leaders from the world's 20 leading economies set an August deadline for an OECD-led global forum to compile information about steel overcapacity, with a report on potential solutions due in November. Eurofer expects apparent EU steel demand to moderate to a 1 percent growth rate next year, as the impact of economic stimulus measures fade. The association previously forecast demand would grow 1.2 percent next year. European steel prices ST-MBEUDNHRC-MB ST-MBEDSHRC-MB ST-MBEDNREB-MB ST-MBEDSREB-MB fell some 10 percent in the second quarter thanks to high inventories and increased import pressure.

Although China cut some 65 million tonnes of steel capacity in 2016 and aims to cut another 50 million tonnes this year, its trading partners say much of the cuts cover already idled capacity and that the problem of unfairly traded steel remains. Chinese steel exports [MTL/CHINA3] fell 25.7 percent in the first five months of this year. However, the country still accounts for about a quarter of global steel exports and about half of the world's spare steelmaking capacity. Reporting by Maytaal Angel, editing by David Evans"

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-oncor-m-a-elliott-idUSKBN19V1JM,ELLIOTT PROPOSES $18.5 BILLION ONCOR DEAL TO TOP BUFFETT,"(Reuters) - Elliott Management Corp, the largest creditor of the bankrupt parent of Oncor Electric Delivery Co, unveiled a plan on Monday to best Berkshire Hathaway Inc's (BRKa.N) deal for the Texas utility with a bid worth $18.5 billion, including debt. Elliott revealed in documents published on its website it was unhappy with the recovery to some creditors under an $18.1 billion deal announced by billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire on Friday. The hedge fund believes its acquisition offer would result in a higher payout to debtholders. New York-based Elliott's proposal to acquire Energy Future Holdings Corp calls for a complex conversion of its debt to equity and for an outside equity partner to help finance the deal. Reuters first reported on Elliott exploring a bid for Oncor on Friday. The offer from the hedge fund, which says it has more than $32 billion under management, would be a rare challenge to Buffett, who avoids auctions for companies and has told his investors he does not like to participate in bidding wars. But even without a competing bid, Buffett's deal faces a difficult road securing the approval of a bankruptcy court judge without Elliott supporting it.  ""We are extremely concerned that introducing a transaction with Berkshire at the current time will significantly undercut and potentially limit Elliott's ability to provide a portion of the financing necessary to achieve the higher and otherwise superior transaction Elliott has proposed,"" the hedge fund said in a letter to the board of Energy Future dated July 5 and released on Monday. Berkshire's offer would help Energy Future exit its costly bankruptcy, which has stretched for over three years as other deals for its crown jewel Oncor fell apart. Energy Future's power generation and retail electricity business were separated from Oncor and emerged from bankruptcy last year. Elliott, run by billionaire Paul Singer, also disclosed on Monday that it would keep in place a corporate ""ringfencing"" structure that would prevent debt from being added to Dallas-based Oncor, or too much cash being paid out as dividends.  Regulators in the utility's home state of Texas have demanded such a structure. That was the reason Florida utility NextEra Energy Inc's (NEE.N) $18.7 billion deal for the utility collapsed earlier this year. Berkshire Hathaway already has reached an agreement on a consensual approval process with regulators, according to a statement from an adviser to Energy Future filed in bankruptcy court. Oncor did not immediately comment on Elliott's letter, while Berkshire was not immediately available for comment. Elliott declined to comment. Elliott's disclosures came after Energy Future filed its new bankruptcy plan of reorganization on Friday. It proposed repaying the unsecured debt that Elliott holds at 18 cents on the dollar.  Should Elliott succeed in its offer for Energy Future its unsecured debt would have a recovery of 50 cents on the dollar, according to people familiar with the matter. Elliott holds $2.9 billion of Energy Future's secured and unsecured debt, enough to try to block the reorganization plan with Berkshire, the people said.  Elliott built up most of its position in Energy Future's debt after Texas regulators rejected NextEra's offer earlier this year, causing bond prices to crash, the sources said. The hedge fund would break even on its debt investment if the Berkshire bid prevails because gains in some parts of its debt holdings, which would be paid out in full, would offset losses in the unsecured bonds it holds, where it would take a deep haircut, the people said. Elliott, known for its aggressive tactics including a 12-year battle over sovereign debt in Argentina, also may pursue litigation to block the deal, the sources said.  Elliott said in the letter it would support a deal with Berkshire or a third party if those bids exceeded the value proposed by the hedge fund. ""We fear that the Berkshire transaction does not provide such value,"" the hedge fund said in the letter. Oncor delivers power to more than 3.4 million homes and businesses through roughly 122,000 miles (196,000 km) of transmission and distribution lines.

http://cnn.com/2017/07/11/asia/india-japan-us-malabar-exercises/index.html,"US, INDIA AND JAPAN BEGIN NAVAL EXERCISES, AS CHINA LOOKS ON","New Delhi (CNN) A rising Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean has prompted the largest naval exercise the region has seen in more than two decades.

The United States, Japan and India have deployed front-line warships, submarines and aircraft as part of the tri-nation Malabar exercises in the Bay of Bengal.

Conducted annually since 1992, Malabar has grown in size and complexity in recent years to address what the US Navy describes as a ""variety of shared threats to maritime security in the Indo-Asia Pacific.""

Formerly a bilateral exercise between India and the US, this year's drill is only the second to include Japan -- and the first to include aircraft carriers from all three navies.

The exercises, which officially began Monday, are intended to provide a ""symbolic reassurance that the US is committed to working with India to continue shaping the Asian security environment,"" said Constantino Xavier, a foreign policy specialist at Carnegie India.

The week-long series of war games will involve a total of 16 ships -- including the nuclear-powered USS Nimitz, India's INS Vikramanditya, a reconditioned Russian-built aircraft carrier, and Japan's JS Izumo, a helicopter carrier with an emphasis on anti-submarine warfare -- as well as two submarines and more than 95 aircraft.

The aircraft carrier USS Nimitz (CVN 68) anchors off the coast of India in preparation for Malabar 2017.

Rising China

The buildup of naval power in the region comes at a time of increased tensions between India and China.

China has steadily increased its naval presence throughout the Indian Ocean in recent years, part of an assertive blue-water strategy that aims to extend the country's operating ability far from Chinese shores.

According to an IndiaSpend analysis of publicly available data, China's People's Liberation Army Navy (PLA-N) has 283 major surface combatant warships, four times more than those under the control of the Indian Navy (66).

Delhi has long viewed the India Ocean as part of its immediate sphere of influence. The expansion of China's naval power -- and its submarine fleet in particular -- has forced Indian leaders to reevaluate the country's coastal defense policy. The Indian Navy has reported at least a dozen sightings of Chinese vessels in the region since May , including submarines.

This year's Malabar exercises will for the first time include exchanges on anti-submarine warfare, patrol and reconnaissance, according to the US Navy.

The Indian Navy has also sent its Sindhughosh class submarine and a P-81 long range maritime surveillance aircraft, underscoring the exercise's anti-submarine focus.

Ten years ago many Indians believed in China's pronouncement that it would be a different kind of world power, one whose power rests on economic development, said Xavier. ""But today, the question in Delhi is not whether China is a threat, but rather, how do we best address this threat?""

Though not a part of Indian territory, the plateau holds immense strategic importance for Delhi and is vital to its geopolitical interests.

Elsewhere, China's close ties with Pakistan -- the two countries recently agreed a deal that gives China access to Pakistan's Gwadar Port -- as well as the construction of China's first overseas military base in Djibouti have added to Delhi's military concerns.

In response to a question relating to Malabar Friday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that China had ""no objection to the development of normal relations and cooperation between countries.""

Global maritime community

India has recently begun to take a more active role in working with regional partners to contain China's influence. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's trip to the US in June , along with the US sale of surveillance drones to the Indian Navy, reaffirmed the two counties' relationship.

And in June, US defense giant Lockheed Martin said it would build F-16 fighter jets in India if Delhi signs an order for as many as 150 of the single-engine warplanes.

Jets take off from the deck of the USS Nimitz.

That sense of openness will likely strike a chord in Beijing. The Bay of Bengal, where the Malabar exercise is taking place, is a strategically important waterway for China, due to its proximity to the Strait of Malacca.

""The Chinese depend fundamentally on the Strait of Malacca (the main shipping channel connecting the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea) for their commerce, trade, export and access to oil in the Middle East,"" said Xavier.

The Indian administered Andaman and Nicobar archipelago, several hundred miles northwest of the Strait of Malacca, provides India with a degree of territorial and strategic leverage over China.

""If they (the Chinese) are choked, if they're not allowed to use that sea line of communication, if the Indians and Japanese start pushing for control of that (the Strait of Malacca), the Chinese will have to look at alternate routes, and that's what they're doing, with the whole belt and road initiative.""

Notably, both India and Japan have declined to participate in China's One Belt, One Road project -- an ambitious series of interlinking trade deals and infrastructure projects throughout Eurasia and the Pacific.

Key events planned during the at-sea portions of the Malabar exercises include submarine familiarization, air defense exercises, surface warfare exercises and anti-submarine warfare, according to the US Navy.

While China will be watching carefully, the exercises are not likely to tip the balance of power in the region. ""It's a cat-and-mouse game,"" said Bharat Karnad, a professor at the Centre for Policy Resesarch in Delhi. ""It's always ongoing."""
http://cnn.com/2017/07/06/health/photoshopped-baby-picture-with-piercing-trnd/index.html,PHOTOSHOPPED BABY PICTURE SPARKS PIERCING DISCUSSION,"(CNN) Enedina Vance was fed up. She felt like other parents didn't understand her message. She felt like they weren't listening to her.

So she got on her phone, found a picture of her 6-month-old daughter and pasted a diamond stud over the infant's dimple to make it look like she had a piercing.

Vance, a strong advocate against piercing or circumcising children, posted the edited picture to Facebook, where it had more than 13,000 shares as of Thursday afternoon.

""I make all of her decisions until she's 18, I made her, I own her!!"" she wrote.

What Vance didn't expect was the reaction she'd get from parents around the world. Outrage. Hate mail. Threats to call Child Protective Services.

But the image also proved her point, and it got parents talking.

""The reaction that parents have when they see this beautiful perfect baby being ... mutilated, that initial shock, that reaction of anger, I want them to hold on to that,"" the 35-year-old said.

Many thought photo was real

The stay-at-home mom from Fostoria, Ohio, knew that seeing a picture of a baby with a dimple piercing would get her family and friends talking, so she shared it in parenting Facebook groups.

The post quickly incited outrage among the parenting community, and she was called ""a bad mother"" and worse.

Many people assumed the piercing was real and lambasted Vance for her apparent decision.

""I seriously can not believe how many people missed that this was purely satirical, I actually used the hashtag #sarcasm,"" Vance wrote on Facebook. ""Yet people were still threatening to beat me to death, call child protective services, & take away my children.""

Other parents simply disagreed with her stance on piercing.

One woman wrote, ""I got my ears pierced as a baby. I grew up just fine. ... I'm having a girl and I will get her ears pierced.""

Ohio law allows children under age 18 to get piercings and tattoos with a parent or guardian present. Most states allow minors to be pierced with parental consent.

Amid the death threats and hate mail, Vance said she also got countless positive messages from parents. Some said they felt they didn't have a choice in whether their sons were circumcised. Another was told it was a ""cleanliness thing.""

""A lot of this responsibility lies on our medical community. They encourage parents,"" Vance said. ""It shouldn't be an option. It shouldn't be a question.""

'Not a good enough reason'

Vance didn't always feel so strongly about circumcision.

Coming from a family of all women, she said she didn't know a lot about circumcision until she became pregnant for the first time in the late '90s. Vance had twin girls, but the research she did stuck in her mind.

""It felt so outdated, so primitive,"" she said. ""We as a civilized society should have grown past this and (I) was shocked that cutting my infant's genitals was even an option.""

Many parents choose to circumcise their children because of hygienic, health or religious reasons.

In 2012, the American Academy of Pediatrics found that the health benefits of circumcision outweigh the risks. However, the academy said the benefits weren't great enough to recommend that all newborn boys be circumcised.

""There is no compelling reason to deny boys their legitimate right to make their own informed decision when they are old enough to do so,"" the report said.

Vance sees this as a call to action and will tell anyone she meets how she feels if it comes up in conversation. She protested last fall in Cleveland with the Bloodstained Men & Their Friends, an organization that advocates against circumcision.

But her beliefs extend beyond circumcision.

""No one has the right to alter, modify, or mutilate another human being's body for aesthetic purposes, not even parents,"" she said.

Vance has argued that ultimately, children should be able to decide for themselves.

""What 1-week-old is asking to have earrings?"" she said. ""Just because it looks cute, just because it looks better -- that's not a good enough reason."""
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-g20-germany-trump-xi-idUSKBN19T0SP,TRUMP KEEPS IT FRIENDLY WITH XI AT G20 ON NORTH KOREA THREAT,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump took a conciliatory tone on Saturday at a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping where the leaders agreed to keep working on two pressing issues: the nuclear threat posed by North Korea and bilateral trade irritants. Trump campaigned in last year's presidential election on cracking down on China for its trade practices, but he softened his rhetoric after taking office, saying he wanted to work with China on the nuclear issue. When the two leaders first met in April at Trump's Florida resort, they appeared to hit it off. Trump called Xi a ""good man"" as he urged him to use Beijing's economic clout to force North Korea to curb its nuclear weapons program. Lately, Trump has expressed some impatience on China's role in North Korea - particularly after Pyongyang launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that some experts believe could have the range to reach Alaska, and parts of the U.S. West Coast. His administration made new arms sales to Taiwan, imposed sanctions on two Chinese citizens and a shipping company and put China on a global human trafficking list. It also accused a Chinese bank of laundering money for Pyongyang. The White House is also debating trade actions against Beijing, including tariffs on its steel exports and a few days before the G20 talks, Trump complained that trade between China and North Korea had grown.  But he showed none of that impatience on Saturday, when the leaders met at the invitation of Xi at the tail end of the G20 in Germany. ""It's an honor to have you as a friend,"" Trump told Xi, telling him he appreciated actions he had already taken on North Korea. ""As far as North Korea is concerned, we will have, eventually, success. It may take longer than I'd like. It may take longer than you'd like. But there will be success in the end one way or the other,"" Trump said. Speaking to reporters later on Air Force One, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the Trump-Xi meeting lasted over an hour-and-a-half, and they had ""substantive discussions"" about how to deal with North Korea together. ""In regards to China, we had very direct discussions about North Korea. We had very direct discussions about military and security cooperation,"" Mnuchin said.   ""I think that President Trump made very clear to President Xi that he is focused on this issue, and wants to move forward and make progress. And I think President Xi gave a very interesting perspective from their standpoint,"" he added.    For his part, Xi told Trump that stronger China-U.S. ties were conducive to stability and prosperity amid global conflicts, and had made ""new progress"" in some areas ""despite some sensitive issues"", Xi said, according to state news agency Xinhua. Xi stressed the importance of talks with North Korea, and said China's navy will join next year's U.S.-led Pacific Rim military exercises. Xinhua said Xi stressed to Trump China's position that it adheres to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and maintaining peace and stability there. While China has been angered by North Korea's repeated nuclear and missile tests, it also blames the United States and South Korea for worsening tension with their military exercises. ""China has many times talked about its principled position, namely that at the same time as the international community making necessary responses to North Korean acts that go against U.N. Security Council resolutions, they must step up efforts to promote talks and manage and control the situation,"" Xinhua said, citing Xi. Xi also reiterated China's opposition to the U.S. deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system in South Korea, Xinhua said. China says THAAD threatens its security, despite U.S. and South Korean assurances it is aimed only at defending against North Korea. Both leaders agreed to maintain close communication and coordination on the Korean peninsula nuclear issue, Xinhua said. In a statement released on Sunday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Xi and Trump had ""enhanced mutual understanding"" about the North Korea issue and ""confirmed the broad direction of using peaceful means to resolve this issue"". Trump also mentioned trade imbalances in his meeting with Xi, calling it a ""very, very big issue"" that he would address. ""I know that China in particular, which is a great trading partner, we will be able to do something that will be equitable and reciprocal,"" Trump said. Senior officials from both countries will meet in Washington on July 19 to discuss economic and trade issues.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-07/bank-behind-gap-jc-penney-store-cards-is-looking-beyond-retail,Missing,"When Macys Inc. reported results that missed analysts estimates, Synchrony Financial investors felt the pain.Margaret KeaneThe largest issuer of private-label credit cards in the U.S. saw its shares drop to their lowest in about seven months on May 11, the day of Macys disappointing first-quarter earnings.Theres just one problem: Macys announced and we went down, and we dont even have Macys, Synchronys Chief Executive Officer Margaret Keane said in an interview at Bloomberg headquarters in New York. We do have to think about more diversification.U.S. retailers have been shutting stores at a record pace as shoppers opt to make more purchases online. In the past year, companies including American Apparel and Limited Stores have begun closing retail branches, while dressmaker BCBG Max Azria, discount shoe seller Payless Inc. and department store operator Gordmans Stores Inc. have filed for bankruptcy.Its surprising we havent seen more retailers go out, said Keane, 57. If you look at the U.S., were over-retailed, we have too many retailers. What youre seeing is a lot of the specialty retailers, the smaller retailers, go under.Amid the carnage, Stamford, Connecticut-based Synchrony has increased reserves to help cover loan losses. Thats crimped earnings and created pressure on the companys stock, which has dropped 19 percent this year, the worst performance in the 66-company S&P 500 Financials Index. Among the Synchrony programs most at risk are its partnerships with Gap Inc., JC Penney Co. and Mens Wearhouse Inc., according to Moodys Investors Service.Read more: Stores closing at a record pace as Amazon chews up retailersThe closures havent stopped customers from using Synchronys products. Spending on the firms private-label cards increased 9.3 percent to $67.8 billion in 2016 from a year earlier, according to the Nilson Report, an industry publication. Retail sales climbed just 2.7 percent during the same period, data compiled by the U.S. Department of Commerce show.The shift from brick-and-mortar shopping to e-commerce should cause write-offs to rise at private-label credit-card providers like Synchrony, according to Moodys analysts led by Jody Shenn. Thats because when customers lose access to geographically convenient locations, their payment behavior typically worsens, they said.The accounts will provide less of an ongoing benefit to consumers who remain current, which in turn makes repaying this debt a lower priority relative to other obligations, the analysts wrote in the June 28 report.Nearly 300 million private-label credit-card loans were outstanding at the end of the first quarter, according to data compiled by Equifax Inc. About 1.8 percent were 30-days past due, a harbinger of future write-offs, compared with 0.84 percent for general purpose credit cards, the firm found.Surging e-commerce sales are affecting other parts of the payments industry as well. Merchant acquirer Vantiv Inc., which gets as much as 50 percent of its revenue from processing transactions for large national chains, agreed Wednesday to buy Londons Worldpay Group Plc for $9.9 billion to gain greater exposure to e-commerce retailers and small businesses.For Synchrony, which was spun out of General Electric Co. in a 2014 initial public offering, the changing retail environment has been an opportunity to create new offerings for retail partners, Keane said. In March, the firm acquired software developer GPShopper to help smaller merchants they work with build customized mobile apps.To further diversify offerings, the firm is weighing expanding its retail bank, which has about $50 billion in deposit, Keane said. The company also would consider acquiring one of the online lenders that have sprung up in recent years, mainly for its technology, she said.We have to protect the core, which is what were in, but there are a couple areas were exploring, Keane said. Were spending some time over the summer to really dig into what else should we be thinking about."
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britainfire-regulations-insight-idUSKBN19U07B,SILENCE OVER WHETHER GRENFELL TOWER MATERIALS PASSED SAFETY TEST,"LONDON (Reuters) - The cladding system used on London's Grenfell Tower would only have met British regulatory standards if the two main materials had passed a key safety test together, according to a Reuters analysis of the building code and data on the materials.     Three weeks after the June 14 fire, neither the two companies involved in the cladding on the Grenfell Tower nor the local authority which enforces the building codes have addressed questions from Reuters about whether that test was ever conducted and its outcome. The test is required to show whether both materials when used together were sufficiently resistant to combustion.  Without proof that it had been carried out, the cladding system would not have met building regulations.     The cladding work carried about by Rydon Group Ltd, the main contractor on the 2014-2016 refurbishment of the building, and its subcontractor Harley Facades involved attaching insulation boards to the tower's concrete facade and covering them with aluminum composite panels.      France's Saint Gobain said the insulation used was its brand of polyisocyanurate (PIR) called Celotex RS5000.     The aluminum panels, which had a polyethylene plastic core were called Reynobond PE, and made by New York-based ArconicInc, previously known as Alcoa Inc.     If all the elements of the insulation system had achieved a separate and demanding government standard called ""limited combustibility"", in separate tests, then a combined test would not have been necessary, according to the building regulations.      But Reynobond PE and Celotex did not meet the combustibility test by themselves, according to safety experts and product specifications published by the manufacturers.       This meant that the two materials combined would need to pass another test known as the BS 8414 test, according to the building regulations. This involves setting a fire under a three-storey mock-up of the proposed wall construction.      Both standards, set out in the guidelines to the building code, aim to prevent a fire spreading quickly from inside and up the exterior walls, something that happened at Grenfell Tower.     In a June 29 email, a spokeswoman for Rydon Group Ltd says it met all building regulations but did not say if the BS 8414test stipulated in the building codes had been conducted.        The building control department of the local Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea council (RBKC), which is responsible for checking that the building and plans are consistent with regulations, declined to say if it had checked the tests had been carried out.        Police think the cladding system at Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of last month's fatal fire. They have said they are investigating possible criminal behavior and the role of all the companies involved in the building.      The Department for Communities and Local Government, the government department which is responsible for setting the regulations enforced by building control, has said the cladding system used at Grenfell did not comply with the building rules it oversees. It has not said why and declined to answer detailed questions on its legal reasoning.    (Link to graphic of Grenfell Tower cladding system:tmsnrt.rs/2t97Ugs)            The test used to assess combined materials must be commissioned from a government approved independent testing agency. Reuters was unable to determine which, if any lab was used.     Rydon, which had a turnover of 249 million pounds last year,  told Reuters the materials it used were suitable for use in tall buildings.     Laboratory testing of the fire resistance of the cladding system used at Grenfell Tower was carried out prior to installation. Please see attached BBA certificate, the spokeswoman said in the June 29 email.     The certificate Rydon provided showed the panels met a separate standard on the surface spread of fire.      Asked specifically about the BS 8414 test, the Rydon spokeswoman said: More technical questions would be better directed at Harley as its their area of expertise.     Executives and a spokesman at Harley, a small company with few assets, declined to comment for this story. It said in a statement on its website last month it was not aware of any link between the fire and the exterior cladding to the tower.     An official at RBKC, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, declined to provide details of the specification it approved or what checks it conducted to ensure the actual construction met the approved plan, citing the ongoing police investigation into the fire.     A spokeswoman for Saint Gobain said its BR 135combustibility certification of Celotex was based on tests conducted with a non-combustible cement façade panel. She declined to say if Celotex had ever passed the BS 8414 test with a flammable façade panel such as Reynobond PE.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-08/us-giving-638m-aid-to-yemen-somalia-nigeria-south-sudan,Missing,"Johannesburg (AP) -- The United States on Saturday announced more than $630 million in aid for Yemen, Somalia, South Sudan and Nigeria, where conflict has helped to cause what the United Nations calls the world's largest humanitarian crisis in more than 70 years.The announcement came as President Donald Trump attended the Group of 20 summit in Germany. ""This is truly a life-saving gift,"" said David Beasley, the new American director of the U.N.'s World Food Program.While the United States is the world's largest humanitarian donor, Trump's proposed deep cuts to foreign aid  more than 30 percent  have caused widespread concern.""We welcome President Trump's attention to the global humanitarian crisis, but he was announcing aid that Congress approved months ago and that his administration has delayed,"" Rev. David Beckmann, president of the Washington-based Christian organization Bread for the World, said in a statement.The total U.S. humanitarian assistance to the four countries is now more than $1.8 billion this fiscal year, the U.S. Agency for International Development said.Tens of millions of people in Yemen, Somalia, South Sudan and Nigeria face hunger amid conflict. Yemen has the world's largest cholera outbreak, while half of drought-hit Somalia's 12 million people need aid. South Sudan's civil war and Nigeria's Boko Haram insurgency have contributed to severe hunger.The WFP said in a tweet that the new U.S. donation ""comes just as families face the time of year when food stocks run out."" The U.N. agency earlier this year warned that food aid could be cut for more than a million hungry Nigerians if promised funding from the international community didn't arrive.In May, Trump announced $329 million in ""anti-famine"" aid to the four countries.While the Trump administration's 2018 spending plan does not eliminate money for emergency food aid, it ends a critical program by consolidating it into a broader account that covers all international disaster assistance. Doing so reduces the amount of money the U.S. dedicates to fighting famine to $1.5 billion next year, from $2.6 billion in 2016.Trump officials say the proposed changes will streamline U.S. aid programs, eliminate redundancies and increase efficiency. Relief organizations fear less U.S. money will mean an increase in famine and hunger-related deaths, particularly in Africa, if Congress approves the budget."
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wanda-sunac-china-m-a-idUSKBN19V06E,"CHINA'S WANDA STEPS BACK FROM THEME PARK, HOTEL DRIVE WITH $9.3 BILLION SUNAC DEAL","HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese property giant Dalian Wanda Group plans to sell tourism projects and hotels in the country to Sunac China (1918.HK) for $9.3 billion, as it dials back its theme-park ambitions and brings down its debt pile. The sale - the second-biggest real estate deal ever in China according to Reuters data - will help strengthen Wanda's case for a mainland listing after its property unit delisted from Hong Kong last year. For Sunac, it would mean ownership of a wide portfolio of tourism developments at a time when it is  spending billions on property and technology assets. Wanda said it would offload 91 percent of thirteen cultural tourism projects, which usually include theme parks and leisure complexes, and 76 hotels to the acquisitive Tianjin-based developer Sunac for 63.18 billion yuan. After the sale, Wanda will, however, continue to play a role in operating and managing the projects. Wanda, which also has interests in films and sports, had plans to build at least 20 cultural projects around China. Its billionaire owner Wang Jianlin had last year said his ""wolf pack"" of parks would beat U.S. rival Walt Disney Co (DIS.N). ""This (deal) signifies a retreat from Wanda's previous strategy in cultural tourism, and marks a pivot to an asset-light strategy,"" said Qin Gang, senior researcher at State Information Center, a government-linked think tank. Beijing has been encouraging development of cultural theme parks as part of a local tourism drive, tapping consumers' growing budget for entertainment. There are over 300 such facilities in China, with most struggling to turn a profit. Wanda's parks are still under construction, except three that have been completed. Two that opened in Nanchang and Hefei last year do not rank in the top 20 by attendance for Asia Pacific, consultancy AECOM's 2016 theme park index shows.  The firm, which had earmarked a more than 300 billion yuan ($44 billion) investment for its cultural and tourism projects, did not give a reason for the sale to Sunac, but local business magazine Caixin quoted Wang as saying the deal would ease the debt burden on Wanda's property unit. ""Through this asset transfer, Wanda Commercial's debt ratio will be greatly reduced, all the proceeds will be used to repay loans. Wanda Commercial plans to repay most of the bank loans this year,"" Wang told Caixin. Analysts said the lower debt load could help Wanda's plans to list the unit in Shanghai and to attract a higher valuation. S&P downgraded Wanda Commercial in December citing rising financial leverage and slower-than-expected asset disposal at China's largest commercial developer. Another downgrade would push the rating into ""junk"" category. The group has been investing heavily in entertainment, leisure and financial businesses and the buying spree has drawn the attention of Chinese regulators, who ordered lenders last month to assess exposure to overseas deals by Wanda, HNA Group, Anbang Insurance [ANBANG.UL] and Fosun (0656.HK). Wanda has been very active globally, with deals for U.S. cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (AMC.N), Hollywood film studio Legendary Entertainment, Infront Sports & Media AG and Spanish soccer team Atletico Madrid.  Sunac too has been shopping. In the past year, boss Sun Hongbin has led the group on an acquisition spree, including $2.1 billion for the real-estate assets of Legend Holdings, parent of PC-maker Lenovo, and $2.2 billion for a stake in Leshi Internet (300104.SZ), a unit of LeEco - a Chinese Netflix-to-Tesla-like conglomerate.  The stake in Wanda cultural and tourism projects will cost Sunac 29.58 billion yuan. The price tag for the hotels is 33.6 billion yuan. The firms are expected to sign an agreement by the end of this month.  Sunac will pay for this from its cashpile that stood at over 90 billion yuan at the end of June, Caixin quoted Sun as saying.  It had total liabilities of 168.6 billion yuan at the end of 2016, versus 64.5 billion yuan the year before.  Shares in Wanda Hotel Development (0169.HK) surged more than 150 percent after news of the deal, though none of the hotels being sold are included under this entity. Wanda said Sunac will be responsible for all the loans for the projects, but the brand name and design will be unchanged. Sunac, whose shares in Hong Kong were suspended from trading ahead of what it said would be a ""very substantial acquisition"" announcement, declined to comment further. Shares in the developer have more than doubled in value this year, but analysts worry Sunac could have bitten off too much. It has a negative outlook rating from Moody's, which said in April Sunac's leverage had deteriorated significantly due to large amounts of debt it had raised to support acquisitions.

http://cnn.com/2017/07/10/politics/kellyanne-conway-anchor-clash-cnntv/index.html,"CNN'S CUOMO, CONWAY CLASH OVER DONALD TRUMP JR.'S MEETING WITH RUSSIAN LAWYER","(CNN) White House counselor Kellyanne Conway defended Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer in a wide-ranging, 35-minute interview Monday with CNN's Chris Cuomo, saying there was ""no information provided that was meaningful.""

""Let's focus on what did not happen in that meeting,"" she said, speaking on ""New Day,"" adding there was ""no action taken. Nothing.""

Conway said the President's son had taken the meeting based on connections made through the Miss Universe pageant and promises of a conversation about adoption policy. She said he did not even know the name of the lawyer going into the meeting.

""Don Jr. has very explicitly stated he didn't even know the name of the person with whom he was meeting,"" she said. ""He agreed to the meeting based on a contact from the Miss Universe Pageant.""

""They get into the meeting and it quickly turns into a pretext for Russian adoption, according to his statements, that the comments this woman is making about any type of information on Hillary Clinton were vague. They were meaningless.""

Trump Jr. changed his account of events as he was presented with new reporting by The New York Times. When the paper first reported on the meeting -- but not about the promise of information about Democrats -- he said it was a ""short, introductory meeting"" about adoption.

""I asked (Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner) and (then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort) to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at that time and there was no follow up,"" Trump Jr. initially said in a statement.

But on Sunday, when the Times -- citing three advisers to the White House briefed on the meeting and two others with knowledge of it -- reported about the lawyer offering to provide information about the Democratic National Committee before he took the meeting, he acknowledged that Democrats and Hillary Clinton were discussed. He said the lawyer had ""no meaningful information"" to offer him, adding that he was not told her name prior to the meeting.

""After pleasantries were exchanged, the woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton,"" Trump Jr. said in the statement. ""Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.""

He added, ""She then changed subjects and began discussing the adoption of Russian children and mentioned the Magnitsky Act. It became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along and that the claims of potentially helpful information were a pretext for the meeting.""

He defended himself, sarcastically, on Twitter Monday: ""Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent... went nowhere but had to listen.""

JUST WATCHED Kellyanne Conway full 'New Day' interview Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Kellyanne Conway full 'New Day' interview 34:52

Trump Jr. on Twitter said there were no inconsistencies in his statements.

""I simply provided more details,"" he tweeted Monday.

Cuomo, however, seized on the changes in Trump Jr.'s story.

""He changed his story twice. You talked about being in a court of law -- not good when you change your story,"" Cuomo said. ""There are big implications when you change your story like this. Second of all, even if it is true, whether or not it was good information, Kellyanne, doesn't mean it was a smart move to take a meeting with a Russian-connected person who was going to give you negative information about your opponent. That could create huge legal issues. You know that.""

""I admire your moxie, sitting there with the CNN chyron next to you,"" she replied.

""I could not be more proud to have that CNN chyron next to me,"" Cuomo fired back.

Throughout the often-tense interview, Conway leveled a sustained attack on the media and CNN in particular, suggesting it was obsessed with the probes into potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.

""Aren't you the least bit reluctant, if not embarrassed, that you now talk about Russia more than you talk about America?"" Conway asked.

Cuomo, however, argued that the President's Twitter feed, which often features attacks on the media and commentary on the Russia investigations, was evidence that the issue mattered to him as well.

""The President spends as much time tweeting about this as anything else,"" said Cuomo. ""I'll show you his thread right now. It's not filled with ideas for new jobs. He's on this stuff as well.""

""I'm sorry, he's the President of the United States and you are looking at his ... social media instead of listening to what he does,"" replied Conway, who followed up with: ""Name three things he talked about at the Department of Transportation.""

Despite her sharp words, however, Conway said twice she had not come on air to attack CNN.

""We appreciate the platform, Chris. But, look ... I'm not here to bash CNN,"" she said, adding, ""We need to find a way to work together better."""
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-chicago-police-idUSKBN19V26H,CHICAGO POLICEMEN PLEAD NOT GUILTY TO COVER-UP IN SHOOTING OF BLACK TEEN,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Three current and former Chicago police officers pleaded not guilty on Monday to felony charges of conspiring to cover up the fatal shooting of an African-American teenager by a white officer, a killing that sparked days of protests. Detective David March and Officers Joseph Walsh and Thomas Gaffney were each charged last month with conspiracy, official misconduct and obstruction of justice. The men entered their pleas at their arraignment in a packed Chicago courtroom before Circuit Judge Diane Gordon Cannon. The next hearing is Aug. 29. The indictments arose from the 2014 incident in which Laquan McDonald, 17, was shot 16 times by Officer Jason Van Dyke. Video footage of the incident showed he was shot as he walked away from police while holding a pocket knife. March, Walsh and Gaffney, who were on the scene the night of the shooting, are alleged to have conspired to conceal the facts of McDonald's killing to protect their fellow officer from criminal investigation and prosecution, according to prosecutors. A police dash-cam video of the shooting, released more than a year after the incident, led to days of protests and thrust Chicago into a national debate over the use of excessive force by police against minorities. The indictment said the officers created false reports on the killing of McDonald. Walsh and March are no longer with the force. Gaffney was suspended without pay, Chicago police representatives said. All three men are white.  Tom Breen, Walsh's lawyer, told reporters that his client would be acquitted. The judge set bond at $50,000 and released the men on the their own recognizance. Van Dyke, accused of murder in the McDonald shooting, pleaded not guilty in 2015. In March, he pleaded not guilty to  16 new counts of aggravated battery. No trial date has been set. The cases come after Chicago police in May finalized stricter limits on when officers can use firearms and other force, the latest attempt to reform a department roiled by misconduct and criticism in the wake of McDonald's death. Last month, members of Black Lives Matter and other groups sued the city to force federal court oversight of those reforms. ""Until people, particularly police officers that do wrong, are held accountable and arrested and put in jail, until that happens there will be no trust among the community and law enforcement,"" said the Rev. Michael Pfleger, an activist who was at the hearing. Editing by Frank McGurty and Matthew Lewis"
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-mosul-idUSKBN19V105,IRAQI PM DECLARES VICTORY OVER ISLAMIC STATE IN MOSUL,"MOSUL/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraq's prime minister declared victory over Islamic State in Mosul on Monday, three years after the militants seized the city and made it the stronghold of a ""caliphate"" they said would take over the world. ""I announce from here the end and the failure and the collapse of the terrorist state of falsehood and terrorism which the terrorist Daesh announced from Mosul,"" Haider al-Abadi said in a speech shown on state television, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. A 100,000-strong alliance of Iraqi government units, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Shi'ite militias launched the offensive to recapture the northern city from the militants in October, with key air and ground support from a U.S.-led coalition. Abadi, wearing a black military uniform and flanked by commanders from the security forces, thanked troops and the coalition. But he warned that more challenges lay ahead. ""We have another mission ahead of us, to create stability, to build and clear Daesh cells, and that requires an intelligence and security effort, and the unity which enabled us to fight Daesh,"" he said before raising an Iraqi flag. Iraq declared a week-long holiday to mark the victory. People celebrated in the streets of the capital Baghdad and southern cities. Abadi arrived in Mosul on Sunday to congratulate military commanders who have waged a nearly nine-month battle to recapture the city, many parts of which were reduced to rubble. Gunfire and explosions could be heard earlier in the day as the last few Islamic State positions were pounded. The coalition said in a statement Iraqi forces were in ""firm control"" of Mosul, but some areas still needed to be cleared of explosive devices and possible Islamic State fighters in hiding. Around the time of Abadi's announcement, Islamic State released a statement claiming to have mounted an attack on Iraqi forces in Mosul. Reuters could not immediately verify the report. Abadi had been meeting military and political officials in Mosul in an atmosphere of celebration that contrasts with the fear that spread after a few hundred Islamic State militants seized the city and the Iraqi army crumbled in July 2014. Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi shocked the Middle East and Western powers three years ago by appearing at the pulpit of Mosul's Grand al-Nuri Mosque to declare the caliphate and himself the leader of the world's Muslims. A reign of terror followed which eventually alienated even many of those Sunni Muslims who had supported the group as allies against Iraq's Shi'ite majority. Opponents of Islamic State were executed and such crimes as smoking a cigarette were punishable by public whipping. Since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, the Shi'ites have been politically dominant in Iraq but the country has been racked by ethnic conflict. (For a  graphic on destruction in Mosul, click tmsnrt.rs/2sV2emM) In the aftermath of victory in Mosul, Abadi's government  faces the task of managing the sectarian tensions there and elsewhere that enabled Islamic State to win support, and the threat of a wave of revenge violence in the city. The coalition warned that victory in Mosul did not mark the end of the group's global threat. ""Now it is time for all Iraqis to unite to ensure ISIS (Islamic State) is defeated across the rest of Iraq and that the conditions that led to the rise of ISIS in Iraq are not allowed to return again,"" Lt. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend said in a statement. U.S. President Donald Trump congratulated Iraq and said Islamic State's days were numbered. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called the victory ""a critical milestone"" in the war against Islamic State. Baghdadi has fled the city and his whereabouts are unknown. Reports have circulated that he is dead but Iraqi and Western officials say they cannot corroborate this.  His death or capture would not be the end of Islamic State, which still controls areas south and west of Mosul and which is now expected to take to the desert or mountains to wage an insurgency. The militants are likely to keep trying to launch attacks on the West and inspiring violence by ""lone wolves"" or small groups of the kind mounted recently in Britain, France and elsewhere. But the loss of Iraq's second-largest city is a grave body blow to Islamic State. Islamic State is also under heavy pressure in its operational headquarters in the Syrian city of Raqqa. But a concern shared by the United States and its coalition allies is that Iran could fill the vacuum left by the Sunni militants to expand in both Iraq and Syria. Qassem Soleimani, head of the Quds Force, the extraterritorial branch of Shi'ite Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said on Monday Iran had sent ""thousands of tonnes"" of arms and fighter jets to Iraq to help it fight Islamic State, Iranian media reported. The stench of corpses along Mosul's streets was a reminder of the gruelling urban warfare required to dislodge Islamic State. Much of the city of 1.5 million has been destroyed in the fighting, its centuries-old stone buildings flattened by air strikes and other explosions. One of Islamic State's last acts was to blow up the historic al-Nuri mosque and its famous leaning minaret. Thousands of people have been killed. The United Nations says 920,000 civilians have fled their homes since the military campaign began in October. Close to 700,000 people are still displaced. ""It's a relief to know that the military campaign in Mosul is ending. The fighting may be over, but the humanitarian crisis is not,"" said U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq Lise Grande.""Many of the people who have fled have lost everything. They need shelter, food, health care, water, sanitation and emergency kits. The levels of trauma we are seeing are some of the highest anywhere. What people have experienced is nearly unimaginable."" Iraqi soldiers relaxed. Some swam in the Tigris river which runs through the city. One wiped the sweat from his face with an Islamic State flag. Writing by Michael Georgy; Editing by Andrew Roche"
http://cnn.com/2017/07/10/politics/trump-knowledge-meeting-natalia-veselnitskaya/index.html,WHITE HOUSE: TRUMP DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT HIS SON'S MEETING WITH RUSSIAN LAWYER,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump only recently learned of the meeting between a Russian lawyer and three of his top campaign officials, including his son Donald Trump, Jr., a White House spokeswoman said Monday.

Trump learned of the meeting ""in the last couple of days,"" Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, describing the meeting Trump's son, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Natalia Veselnitskaya, as ""very short"" with ""absolutely no follow up.""

""The only thing I see inappropriate about the meeting was the people who leaked the information on the meeting after it was voluntarily disclosed,"" Sanders said, slamming leaks and later the Democratic National Committee.

The White House statement echoed what Mark Corallo, a spokesman for the President's legal team, said on Sunday.

""The President was not aware of, and did not attend, the meeting,"" he said.

Vice President Mike Pence was also unaware of the meeting until recently, a spokesman told CNN on Monday.

""The vice president was not aware of the meeting,"" said Marc Lotter, Pence's spokesman. ""He is not focused on stories about the campaign, particularly stories about the time before he joined the ticket.""

The meeting with Trump's son and campaign officials happened on June 9, 2016, over a month before Pence -- then Indiana's governor -- joined the Trump campaign on July 15.

Pence, in an interview with CBS News, said ""of course"" no one from the campaign met with Russians trying to meddle in the election.

""Did any adviser or anybody in the Trump campaign have any contact with the Russians who were trying to meddle in the election?"" CBS' John Dickerson asked on January 15.

""Of course not,"" Pence replied. ""And I think to suggest that is to give credence to some of these bizarre rumors that have swirled around the candidacy.""

Donald Trump Jr., in response to a New York Times story about his meeting, said on Saturday that his meeting with Veselnitskaya was primarily about ""adoptions.""

But the President's son and operator of the family's business said in response to another Saturday New York Times report that the meeting was, in part, to gain damaging information about Hillary Clinton.

""After pleasantries were exchanged, the woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton,"" Trump Jr. said in a statement. ""Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.""

The meeting later pivoted, Trump's son said, to adoptions and a US law known as the Magnitsky Act, which allows the US to withhold visas and freeze the assets of Russians thought to have violated human rights.

Sanders said later in the briefing that Trump's son ""did not collude with anybody to influence the election.""

Asked if it was normal and standard practice during the campaign to have meeting like the one Trump Jr. had.

""I don't know any other meetings with Don Jr. but I also haven't had an extensive conversation with him,"" Sanders added.

The meeting -- and its revelation -- underscores how the swirl of stories about Russia continues here in Washington, even after Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the G20 in Hamburg, Germany. White House aides had hoped that the meeting between the two world leaders would have helped stem the stream of stories, but were greeted by the New York Times report when they touched down in Washington after the foreign trip.

A spokesperson for Donald Trump Jr. confirms the first son has now hired Washington attorney Alan Futerfas to represent him in the ongoing matters.

Veselnitskaya founded a group that sought to remove Moscow's ban on the adoption of Russian children by US citizens.

Clinton's former campaign chairman, John Podesta, looked to ridicule Trump on Monday when he tweeted about the fact Trump didn't know about the meeting at the time.

Some lenders are worried about a squeeze on their profit margin, but the number of them has fallen since the fourth quarter of 2016, according to the 184 mortgage executives who responded to the survey. In a response to a tougher climate, more lenders said they plan to relax their lending standards, which could attract more borrowers, survey data showed. Expectations to ease credit standards climbed to survey highpoints in the second quarter as more lenders reported slowing mortgage demand and increasing concerns about competition from other lenders, Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae's chief economist at Washington-based mortgage finance agency, said in a statement. The margin on the share of lenders who saw a drop in consumer demand for a loan to buy a home in the past three months over the share of lenders who saw a rise in purchase loan demand fell to about 30 percent, the lowest in two years on a year-over-year basis, Fannie Mae said. The net percentage of lenders which anticipate lower profit margin in the next three months stood at 6 points, down from 12 points in the first quarter and from 31 points in the fourth quarter of 2016. The net share of lenders which expect to ease credit standards rose to 15 points in the second quarter, up from about 3.5 points a year earlier.

Hamburg, Germany (CNN) Ivanka Trump, President Donald Trump's daughter and one of his top White House aides, briefly took her father's place at a meeting with other world leaders at the G20 summit here in Hamburg on Saturday, causing a stir among Trump critics on social media.

A photo of the first daughter sitting next to Chinese President Xi Jinping, British Prime Minister Theresa May, Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan and German Chancellor Angela Merkel was first tweeted by Svetlana Lukash, who identifies herself on Twitter as a G20 Russian sherpa, a title given to people who help international delegations at large summits.

A senior Trump administration official confirmed that Ivanka Trump had stepped in for her father, but dismissed any suggestion it was improper or unusual.

""Ivanka was sitting in the back and then briefly joined the main table when the President had to step out, and the president of the World Bank started talking as the topic involved areas such as African development -- areas that will benefit from the facility just announced by the World Bank,"" the official said, referencing a initiative Ivanka Trump has spearheaded that looks to fund women entrepreneurs.

Instead, shares that had been riding high in anticipation of his most consequential car yet are poised for their worst week in almost a year and a half.A troublesome quarterly sales report, the emergence of competing electric vehicles from the likes of Volvo Car Group and lingering concern about Teslas ability to mass produce have sent its stock down 13 percent this week. Modest gains in Friday trading still have left the shares on course for their steepest weekly drop since February 2016, and Teslas market value has dropped back below General Motors Co.This weeks worries put a damper on the arrival of the linchpin to Musks growth ambitions. For Tesla, bringing out Model 3 and becoming more of a mass-market carmaker will require overcoming the routine manufacturing issues that have handicapped output of batteries or Model X sport utility vehicles. And so-called legacy automakers have sent a clear signal they wont go down without a fight -- Volvo underscored this by announcing all of its new models will have hybrid or fully electric powertrains from 2019.Tesla still faces a lot of challenges, said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at Autotrader. The company needs to focus on quality over speed as they ramp up the Model 3. The Volvo announcement drove home the fact that Tesla is going to face more competition.The first blow to Tesla stock came just after regular trading stopped ahead of the July 4 holiday. The Palo Alto, California-based posted a quarter-by-quarter drop for both the Model S sedan and Model X SUV for the three months ending in June. Musk needs revenue from both to keep funding the costly introduction of the Model 3 and get production to levels that could put Tesla on course for profits that have mostly eluded the company.Tesla issued an update to its deliveries figures on Friday to add that about 3,500 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the second quarter, detail that was missing from its initial statement Monday. The company said those cars will count toward its third-quarter tally.Within its sales report, Tesla cited issues with making 100 kWh batteries, a disclosure analysts have said should have been made earlier. The surprise snag reinforced doubts about whether Musk can smoothly ramp up to building hundreds of thousands of cars annually, from the roughly 84,000 built last year.Musk himself seems to have dialed back his expectations. The chief executive officer tweeted this week that Tesla was planning to hand over the keys to the first 30 owners of the Model 3 on July 28, produce 100 of the cars in August, more than 1,500 in September and 20,000 in December.Thats well below the 100,000 to 200,000 Model 3s that Musk said in May 2016 was Teslas goal for the second half of this year. On the same earnings call last year that the CEO gave that forecast, Musk said Tesla was going to be hell-bent on becoming the best manufacturer on earth.In addition to execution risk, competitive threats have dragged on Tesla shares. On Wednesday, Volvo said it planned to electrify its entire lineup and have five models powered entirely by batteries in its lineup by 2021. The Swedish carmaker owned by China-based Geely Automobile Holdings underscored that Tesla will soon have more competition coming from major carmakers, Barclays Plc analyst Brian Johnson said.Weve long argued that Tesla as an EV company is not truly disruptive, in that legacy carmakers will eventually wake up and offer fully electric vehicles by the early 2020s, Johnson wrote in a report Wednesday.Volkswagen AG bolstered Johnsons view days later, with the German automakers namesake brand chief touting an electric hatchback similar to the bestselling Golf. The car, dubbed Neo, will be priced along the lines of the Golfs diesel version and have a range of as much as 600 kilometers (370 miles) on a full battery, Herbert Diess said in an interview.We see Volkswagen as the company that can stop Tesla, because we have abilities Tesla doesnt have today, Diess said in Frankfurt.Teslas stock has long been caught in the middle of a duel between short sellers and Musks true believers, with Musk drawing big-name detractors including Jim Chanos, who famously bet early on energy company Enron Corp.s failure and was proved right.Short interest in Tesla has ebbed but is still at 23 percent of the float, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Greenlight Capital Management founder David Einhorn, who successfully pressured Apple Inc. to double cash returns to shareholders in 2013, also has been shorting the company.Tesla still has plenty of bulls betting the companys value will grow over the long term despite many bumps along the way. Thousands stood in lengthy lines at Tesla stores last spring to place $1,000 deposits for the Model 3, which is expected to start at about $35,000 before options or incentives and have a range of at least 215 miles per charge.Longtime Apple analyst Gene Munster said this week the launch of the Model 3 will ultimately be compared to Apple Inc.s introduction of its iPhone.Over the next 10 years the Model 3s value, in combination with its technology, has the potential to change the world and accelerate the adoption of electric and autonomous vehicles, Munster wrote in a report Wednesday. This should propel shares of TSLA higher and, more importantly, advance us to a new paradigm in transportation, car ownership, ride hailing, city development, and energy usage.The fact that Musks clean-energy pursuits extend beyond cars helped keep the week from being even worse for Tesla. The billionaire said a supply contract with South Australia reached on Friday will bring about the words largest lithium-ion battery system. Tesla climbed as much as 2.6 percent at 12:35 p.m. Friday.Australia aside, the slowing of Model S and Model X sales and production issues continuing to plague Teslas plants has shown Musk has lots of work ahead to accomplish his grand vision, let alone support Teslas more than $50 billion market capitalization.In May, Musk told the Guardian newspaper that Teslas valuation topping carmakers that sell substantially more vehicles -- like GM -- was unwarranted.I do believe this market cap is higher than we have any right to deserve, Musk said."

""If Chelsea Clinton were asked to hold the seat for her mother, as her mother gave our country away, the Fake News would say CHELSEA FOR PRES!"" he tweeted, referring to the daughter of Hillary Clinton, his Democratic rival in last year's presidential election.

Her appearance prompted a string of reactions on Twitter and caught the attention of the German media and other outlets.   Donald Trump, in a separate tweet, called the arrangement ""very standard"" and  also noted that German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was hosting the G20 summit, agreed. Merkel had dismissed the move at a news briefing after the summit.  ""Ivanka belongs to the U.S. delegation,"" Merkel, who has worked with her on various issues, said last week.       Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, also defended Ivanka, saying on Sunday that the president's daughter had often sat in on meetings with her and Trump, especially those regarding women and business. Ivanka Trump ran a clothing and jewelry business before taking a formal job at the White House after her father took office in January and has adopted women's issues as a signature policy area. At the G20, she also took the spotlight at a separate event alongside World Bank President Jim Yong Kim for a public-private loan program aimed at boosting female entrepreneurs in developing countries. Lawrence Summers, a former World Bank official and economic adviser under former Democratic president Barack Obama, said it was rare for government heads to leave during major summits and that, when they must, foreign ministers or other very senior government officials normally fill in.  ""There is no precedent for a head of governments adult child taking a seat,"" he wrote in the Washington Post. ""There is no precedent for good reason.

There was a moment, sometime early this season, when Aaron Judge took over New York.

Monday, he took over all of baseball.

He did it with power. He did it with style. He did it with grace.

Maybe it's too early to call him the game's biggest star, just halfway into his rookie season with the New York Yankees. But maybe it's not.

He is the biggest, obviously, if you just go by his 6'7"", 282-pound frame. But in taking over a Home Run Derby that quickly became all about him, Judge showed everything New York has seen this year and more.

""I am buying Aaron Judge for the long, long haul,"" Mark Teixeira said on ESPN after Judge needed barely half the allotted time to dispose of Miguel Sano in the Derby's final round.

Teixeira, by the way, was another star of the night, clearly showing he deserves more exposure in his rookie season as a broadcaster. He was fun and funny, and early on, he asked Judge the perfect question:

""Can you get over 500 [feet]?""

""I'm going to try for it,"" Judge said.

And he did. No one else did, but Judge did it four times, going 501, 504, 507 and 513 feet. He hit one off the roof and another one over Marlins Park's home run sculpture in left-center field. He went to left field and to right field. He hit line drives and spectacular towering shots.

He hit 47 home runs in all, totaling 3.9 miles according to MLB.com's Statcast. Do yourself a favor and click on the ""staggered fast"" option on Baseball Savant, which makes Judge's home runs look like a cool fireworks show.

He said he just wanted to put on a show for the fans. This was a show.

""Next year for the Derby, we're just going to have Aaron Judge try to beat himself,"" Teixeira said at one point. ""We're going to have brackets where he's just going to play himself.""

The official numbers will tell you Judge barely survived the first round, needing the extra 30 seconds he earned with two 440-foot homers to top the 22 home runs hit by Miami Marlins first baseman Justin Bour. It looked like a potential disaster for Major League Baseball and ESPN, which set this up as Judge vs. Giancarlo Stanton but had already lost Stanton to a first-round knockout by Yankees catcher Gary Sanchez.

Bour was popular with the Marlins fans in attendance, but it wouldn't have played well around the baseball world to have Stanton and Judge out early.

As it turned out, Stanton's exit hardly mattered because Judge could more than carry this show by himself.

He's done that all season with the Yankees, where his at-bats quickly became the one thing you never wanted to miss. His batting-practice shows are becoming legendary too, with tales of damage to a television set high above center field at Yankee Stadium and balls hit over the center field restaurant in Toronto.

""I watched him hit [batting practice home runs] in Oakland to places not even [Mark] McGwire and [Jose] Canseco used to go,"" one American League scout said a couple of weeks back.

Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images

In this season where home runs are dominating the game more than ever before, there have been suggestions that the number of homers could hurt interest in baseball. The ball needs to be in play more, some have said.

Overall, perhaps that's true. But nobody ever complains about watching Judge, not after any of his major league-leading 30 home runs and not after the show he put on Monday night in Miami.

He did everything right, no surprise to anyone who has watched him closely in New York. The big stage didn't bother him at all, also no surprise.

And when it came time to claim the trophy, he made sure Yankees batting practice pitcher Danilo Valiente got his hands on it too.

Judge handles all of this so well, which is a big reason you never hear a word of criticism from teammates, opponents or even grouchy fans.

The players see. The players know.

MLB handed Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner a microphone midway through Monday's Derby and asked him to interview some National League teammates on Facebook Live.

""If you were a superhero, who would you want to be?"" Turner asked Bryce Harper.

""Probably Judge,"" Harper shot back.

This was his night. This is his year.

Right now, you'd have to say, this is his game.

Liu has accumulated a large amount of abdominal fluid, the statement said, calling his condition ""quite serious.""The hospital said the experts were Dr. Markus W. Buchler of Heidelberg University in Germany and Dr. Joseph Herman of the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas.It was impossible to independently verify the hospital's description of Buchler's and Herman's views on Liu's illness. A source familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of discussions confirmed that the American and German experts had seen Liu and spoken to his family.Shang Baojun, Liu's former lawyer and a close friend, said that during the consultation with the foreign experts, Liu was ""clear-headed and communicated smoothly, and could even speak English.""""He again expressed a desire to go abroad for treatment, preferably in Germany, though the U.S. would also be fine, and his family members said the same,"" Shang told The Associated Press. ""We sincerely hope this request will be approved.""The experts' visit comes as Liu's illness has taken a turn for the worse. Chinese doctors said Friday that they have stopped using cancer-fighting drugs so as not to overwhelm his severely weakened liver.On Saturday, the hospital said that the doctors may review MRI scans and further assess Liu's liver function before deciding on whether to use radiation therapy, immunotherapy and other treatments.""We will continue to provide nutritional support, pain relief and other forms of supportive care to improve the patient's quality of life as much as possible,"" the hospital's statement said.In a sign of the seriousness of Liu's decline, his younger and older brothers and their wives were being allowed to see him, Shang said. At the hospital, Liu has been mostly accompanied by his wife and her brother, both of whom have been largely unreachable by the outside world due to restrictions by Chinese authorities.Beijing activist Hu Jia, a family friend, said the relatives' visit was a sign that the authorities have acknowledged Liu's rapid deterioration.""I think the authorities are in crisis mode. They too are not sure if Liu Xiaobo will pass away soon because his condition is quite obviously worsening,"" Hu said.""They don't want to bear too great a responsibility in this respect,"" he said, referring to the act of allowing Liu to be with his brothers at a critical stage. ""The authorities think by doing this they could at least be accountable to the outside world and say Liu was with his loved ones at the very end.""Liu's two brothers, who were traveling from their homes in southern and northeastern China, were being closely monitored by state security agents along the way  making it difficult to maintain contact with them, Hu said.Beijing has come under criticism from Western governments for not fully releasing Liu, who was diagnosed with late-stage liver cancer in May while serving an 11-year sentence for inciting subversion by advocating sweeping political reforms that would end one-party rule. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, the year after he was convicted and jailed by a Chinese court.The office of the United Nations human rights chief on Friday also expressed concern about Liu's condition and noted that the Chinese government has provided no further information to the U.N. office for more than 24 hours.Spokeswoman Liz Throssell said at a briefing in Geneva that the U.N. should be granted access to both Liu and his wife.China's foreign ministry had no immediate response to a request for comment Saturday."

That dynamic may be on the verge of reversing with a turnaround in policy now underway in developed nations other than Japan, Mikihiro Matsuoka, chief economist of the Japanese unit of Deutsche Bank AG, wrote in a note dated July 10.The average of the standard deviation of stock-market capitalization as a percentage of GDP in seven major developed countries has been approaching the previous peaks of 2000 and 2008, Matsuoka highlighted.The first sign of the 2008 crisis was a suspension of redemptions at a hedge fund. This time around, signs of a problem may include a deterioration in the quality of securitized U.S. auto loan products, and/or the deterioration of the financing of emerging market countries following U.S. interest rate rises, he said.Read: Big Central Banks Face New Dilemmas as Markets RallyAnd, like the way that the first round of Federal Reserve quantitative easing was the most powerful, likewise, the first round of the withdrawal of monetary accommodation could well deliver a bigger negative effect on the financial market and the real economy than the ensuing second and third shots of monetary-policy turnaround, he wrote.Matsuoka said a number of factors have been preventing or postponing a large-scale and prolonged correction in asset prices:It would be better to assume that these four buffers will weaken over the long run, Matsuoka said. At the same time, he said its impossible to say now whether the market conditions he describes amount to simple froth, or something more worrying: We would never know if this is a bubble until it bursts."

The firm's biggest domestic rival, Suez (SEVI.PA), announced the $3.4 billion purchase of GE Water from General Electric (GE.N) in March. Asked whether Veolia could spend as much on an acquisition, its boss Antoine Frerot told Reuters the size of the group's balance sheet ""would allow it"".  Frerot, who earlier this year said he would favor organic growth for the business, laid out two conditions for any future large acquisition. ""It would need to create new large-size activities for the company and over a long period of at least 10 to 15 years,"" Frerot said in an interview at a business conference in the southeastern city of Aix-en-Provence.  ""If we found this, then obviously we'd have the means to do it,"" he said, declining to elaborate on possible targets. Veolia, which also cleans up nuclear facilities and treats low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste, could also benefit from a 50-billion-euro ($57 billion) upgrade of French nuclear sites operated by energy provider EDF (EDF.PA), Frerot said.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/10/news/economy/health-care-uninsured-rate/index.html?section=money_topstories,AMERICA'S UNINSURED RATE IS ON THE RISE,"The share of Americans who lack health insurance is on the rise, reversing years of declines since Obamacare was enacted.

Some 11.7% of Americans were uninsured in the second quarter of 2017, up from a record low of 10.9% at the end of 2016, according to the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index, released Monday. That's an increase of about 2 million people, said Dan Witters, the index's research director.

The uninsured rate has steadily drifted downward since the Obamacare exchanges opened and Medicaid expansion kicked in at the start of 2014. It had peaked at 18% in the third quarter of 2013.

Several factors could be driving the uptick, Gallup said. Premiums rose substantially in 2017 for those who don't qualify for federal subsidies, and many consumers had fewer choices on the exchanges because insurers bailed out of Obamacare this year.

Uncertainty in Washington, D.C. surrounding Obamacare's future may also be prompting Americans to drop coverage, especially if they question whether the penalty for not having insurance will be enforced under the Trump administration.

""There is enough uncertainty to make people wander away,"" said Witters.

Related: Senate health care bill would mean big coverage losses in these states

Some 20 million people gained coverage under Obamacare, driving the uninsured rate to record lows last year, according to government data.

The Senate is currently debating a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, with senators deeply divided over cuts to Medicaid, reductions to federal subsidies to help people pay for care and other provisions. The House passed its version in May. The Congressional Budget Office found that at least 22 million fewer people would be covered by 2026, as compared to current law, under the bills working their way through Congress.

The increase in the uninsured has been concentrated among young adults, ages 26 to 34, Gallup found. Their rate has jumped 1.5 percentage points since the end of last year. They may be most sensitive to rising premiums on coverage they may not use that much. Instead, they may prefer to pay the penalty.

This group had been among the largest beneficiaries of Obamacare since they were the group most likely to be eligible for subsidies. Their uninsured rate had fallen nearly 10 percentage points between the end of 2013 and 2016.

This demographic is also key to the health of the individual market since their premiums help offset the higher costs of those in their 50s and early 60s, who typically need more care. One of Obamacare's shortcomings is that it didn't attract as many younger enrollees as hoped.

The Gallup report also found that fewer people are buying their own policies this year. The share who pay for their own plan -- many of which are bought on the exchanges -- fell 0.7 percentage points since the end of 2016.

It had risen nearly 4 percentage points between 2013 and last year."

Andelman, a frequent contributor to CNN Opinion and columnist for USA Today, is the author of "" A Shattered Peace: Versailles 1919 and the Price We Pay Today ."" He formerly served as a foreign correspondent for The New York Times and Paris correspondent for CBS News. Follow him on Twitter @DavidAndelman . The views expressed in this commentary are his own.

PARIS President Donald Trump, back in Washington from the G20 summit and relaxing Sunday at his Virginia golf club, has managed to leave behind a succession of landmines likely to explode in the coming weeks and months. With each explosion, the United States is increasingly likely to find itself as a pariah nation on the global stage.

Some of these explosive issues had been long anticipated -- following weeks, even months, of vitriolic Trump tweets that effectively poisoned the atmosphere for many world leaders and especially for their top aides who were responsible for crafting the agenda and will be in charge of shepherding these issues going forward.

Let's take a closer look:

Climate change

The United States is as isolated as it has ever been on climate change, which is hardly surprising as Trump was the only leader to withdraw his nation from the Paris COP21 climate agreement, signed by 175 countries . The G20 final communique in Hamburg was the first formal indication that no one is prepared to follow Trump out the door.

Moreover, French President Emmanuel Macron used the G20 platform to call for a global climate summit on December 12, the second anniversary of its drafting, with the aim of moving the pact forward through public and private financing of projects worldwide.

Trade

With President Trump telling British Prime Minister Theresa May, as one senior government source told The Sunday Times of London , ""that the United Kingdom will thrive outside the EU,"" the pressure only intensifies for May to make good both on a hard Brexit and a rapid negotiation of a favorable trade pact with the United States.

At the same time, just as the G20 was about to get underway, the EU announced it had already negotiated its own trade deal with Japan, following the framework for a similar pact with Canada. Indeed, with Trump standing silently by, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called his new EU arrangement a ""model for the 21st century.""

Ironically, the United States has failed even to begin any meaningful bilateral negotiations for such free trade mechanisms with either the UK or Japan, though bilateral pacts are what Trump has advocated loudly and repeatedly. Now, benchmarks have been set for any such negotiations going forward -- yet another potential landmine for Trump's business agenda.

Next up? German Chancellor Angela Merkel suggested an EU-China investment treaty may not be far behind. Indeed, the day before the G20 got underway, with Merkel and Xi looking on, China signed a $22 billion deal to buy 140 planes from the European Airbus consortium. New aerospace jobs may now go to European workers.

Russia

Barely 24 hours after Trump and Putin glowed over a ceasefire in southwestern Syria, the fifth such agreement in the past six years went into effect. Still, both Russia and the United States are working out how to monitor and enforce it. Moreover, there's no hint here that Russia is any closer to lifting its support from the Bashar al-Assad regime, or that the United States is any closer to finding a path forward for its own interests.

And then there's the cybersecurity pact that Trump and Putin announced -- the creation of a somewhat vaguely defined joint unit to guard against the use of cyber tools in election hacking, and which Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio promptly denounced as ""partnering with Syrian President Bashar Assad on a Chemical Weapons Unit."" How long will that take to blow up, and how likely is it simply to give the Kremlin cover on cyber shenanigans in much of the world?

China and North Korea

Let's start with the White House press release calling Chinese President Xi Jinping the President of the Republic of China, which is the official name for Taiwan, just minutes after Trump was waxing eloquent about their ""wonderful relationship."" Both leaders tried to plaster smiles on their faces, but there is no getting around Xi's visit to Moscow en route to the G20, when leaders of both nations shook hands on an agreement that would ban North Korean missile tests as well as US-South Korean military drills.

The United States has suggested that this is a highly asymmetric agreement -- one that North Korea is likely to breach without warning and that leaves South Korea and Japan deeply vulnerable. It also takes no steps toward even more vital efforts to restrain North Korea's efforts to develop a deliverable nuclear weapon.

Mexico

All but lost in the excitement of meetings Trump held was his first face-to-face meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto since Trump took office. With the Mexican leader sitting by his side, Trump reiterated publicly , yet again, that Mexico will ""absolutely"" pay for the wall on its northern border. Pena Nieto failed to challenge this embarrassing boast, which promptly inflamed opinion back home over the ""cowardice"" of the Mexican leader in dealing with an American President who apparently has little appreciation or sensitivity for Mexican feelings. Clearly, the path forward for relations between these two neighbors has only been re-paved with ill intentions.

Effectively, Trump left the G20 in precisely the place he wanted, but as seen through a fun house mirror. By turning his weekend's focus to a succession of bilateral schmooze fests, he left the leadership of the rest of the world to the likes of Merkel, Xi , Macron, even Putin.

His ""America First"" philosophy has left a vacuum going forward that will only be filled by others with their own interests and motivations. In an increasingly globalized world, an American President is willingly contributing to a chasm increasingly impossible to bridge."

(CNN) Tupac Shakur lived much of his life in the limelight, but a letter that has surfaced from his past seems to offer rare insight into one of the late rapper's relationships.

In a note to Madonna, reportedly written by Shakur while he was serving time in prison in 1995, he acknowledges ending their romantic relationship because of her race.

""For you to be seen with a black man wouldn't in any way jeopardize your career, if anything it would make you seem that much more open and exciting,"" Tupac wrote. ""But for me at least in my previous perception I felt due to my 'image' that I would be letting down half of the people who made me what I thought I was.""

While CNN has not independently confirmed the letter's authenticity, the auction site allowed TMZ to photograph the note and publish excerpts.

Governing Council member Klaas Knot, speaking on Dutch television on Friday night, warned that the central bank is very close to the point of keeping quantitative easing for too long.Peter PraetThe remarks reflect the dissonance since the start of the year in the Governing Council over when officials should discuss winding down their 2.3 billion-euro ($2.6 billion) asset-purchase program. Praet has consistently called for patience, while colleagues such as Knot and Germanys Jens Weidmann have warned against leaving it too late, and Executive Board member Benoit Coeure has said a failure to be transparent can increase market volatility.Knot, speaking on Dutch TVs Nieuwsuur, noted that the last financial crisis was partly caused by too much money being pumped into the system, and so the ECB should be wary of going too far with stimulus.If we carry on with this policy for too long, that is absolutely a potential danger, he said. The difficulty is that one cannot determine objectively when the moment is when we have continued with this policy for too long. I think that we have gotten very close to that moment.Economic data on Friday highlighted the strength of the currency blocs upturn, with industrial production beating expectations in Germany, France and Spain -- three of the four largest economies. Still, the ECB doesnt foresee consumer-price growth returning to its goal of just below 2 percent on a sustained basis until at least late 2019. The Governing Council next meets to set policy on July 20.Inflation is picking up, but that is a process that is a long way from completion, Praet said. From an inflation perspective, we cannot be satisfied yet."
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-09/urgent-foreign-doctors-deem-ill-chinese-nobel-laureate-ok-to-travel,FOREIGN DOCTORS DEEM ILL CHINESE NOBEL LAUREATE OK TO TRAVEL,"Beijing (AP) -- Two foreign specialists who visited Liu Xiaobo said Sunday that the cancer-stricken Nobel Peace Prize laureate can safely travel abroad for treatment, apparently contradicting statements by Chinese experts who say a medical evacuation would be unsafe for China's best-known political prisoner.The American and German doctors, who saw Liu on Saturday, issued a joint statement saying that their home institutions  the University of Heidelberg and the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas  have agreed to accept Liu, but that any evacuation would have to take place ""as quickly as possible.""Liu was diagnosed in May with late-stage liver cancer while serving an 11-year sentence for inciting subversion by advocating sweeping political reforms that would end China's one-party rule. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, the year after he was convicted and jailed by a Chinese court.The differing opinions about the feasibility of Liu traveling could further complicate the tug-of-war over the 61 -year-old activist. For weeks, family and supporters have asked for Liu to be fully released and allowed to receive treatment abroad, arguing that authorities are keeping him in China only out of political considerations.Meanwhile, the Chinese government has maintained that Liu is receiving the best treatment possible at the First Hospital of China Medical University in the northern city of Shenyang. Chinese state media have labeled Liu a convicted criminal, and the government has warned other countries to stay out of China's internal affairs.Following international criticism, China allowed the two foreign experts, Dr. Markus W. Buchler of Heidelberg University and Dr. Joseph Herman of the MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas, to visit Liu.Buchler and Herman said in their statement Sunday that they ""acknowledged"" the quality of care Liu has received in Shenyang. But they said that Liu expressed a desire to leave China, and that they judged that he ""can be safely transported with appropriate medical evacuation care and support.""Hours after the foreign doctors announced their opinion, Jared Genser, a Washington-based lawyer who represents Liu internationally, said that any decision by Chinese authorities to still keep Liu would amount to ""intentionally hastening his death"" and ""refusing to honor the wishes of a dying man to receive the treatment he desires.""""The moment that Liu Xiaobo and (wife) Liu Xia were to be allowed by the Chinese government to travel, we have a medevac ready to take them abroad,"" Genser said in an email.Already criticized for letting an imprisoned Nobel laureate fall terminally ill on its watch, the Chinese government faces a public relations disaster whether Liu stays in the country or goes abroad.Hu Jia, a Chinese dissident and family friend, said that Beijing is afraid of letting its most potent opposition symbol go abroad as long as he is able to speak to the media.""As long as he can still talk, the global media will report and transmit his message to the world,"" Hu said. ""Every sound he utters will be recorded as a force for changing China.""Shang Baojun, a former lawyer for Liu who remains close to the family, told The Associated Press on Saturday that Liu was coherent enough during the visit with the foreign doctors to say that he wanted to go abroad for treatment, preferably to Germany, although the U.S. would also be fine. At times, Liu was lucid enough to communicate in English, Shang said.The hospital itself released a brief online statement late Saturday that quoted an unnamed Chinese expert as saying it would be unsafe for Liu to travel abroad. The hospital has previously said that Liu's liver function is deteriorating, and that blood clots are forming in his left leg and could potentially travel to the brain or the lungs, leading to death.Phone calls to the hospital's administration department and publicity office rang unanswered Sunday.The U.S. urged China to allow Liu to travel.""We continue to call on the Chinese authorities to grant Mr. Liu full parole and to release his wife, Liu Xia, from house arrest, and to allow them to travel to seek specialized care that would ease his suffering in his final days,"" said Mary Beth Polley, the spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.Hu agreed that Liu was almost certain to die soon regardless of where he was.""Letting him fly away from his hell would be a massive psychological boost, stronger than any medicine you can give him,"" Hu said. ""It will improve his final days, so he will die with dignity  and in the free world.""___Associated Press writer Gillian Wong contributed to this report."
http://cnn.com/2017/07/06/opinions/trump-poland-charles-crawford/index.html,WHY TRUMP WILL FEEL AT HOME IN EASTERN EUROPE,"Charles Crawford is a former British ambassador to Poland and has held other diplomatic postings in Eastern and Central Europe. The opinions in this article belong to the author.

What's happening here? Given Poland's grim historical experiences under Russian imperialism, shouldn't any sane Pole be more than a little uneasy about the new US President, thought by many to be much too close to Russia's Vladimir Putin?

Maybe. But Europe is a complicated place at the moment.

The European Union, in fact, contains two Europes.

""Western Europe"" is made up of countries that grew as plump, modern democracies under an American security umbrella and invented the EU.

Meanwhile, ""former communist Europe"" -- sometimes called ""Eastern Europe"" -- battled for decades to break from Soviet-imposed communism and find its own voice.

Many ""Western Europeans"" are comfortable with largely secular, post-modern, liberal-technocratic integration that dilutes national identity. Indeed, for some European federalists, diluting national identity is not a cost, nor even something to worry about: it is the whole point of the federalist policy.

By contrast, much of ""post-communist Europe"" likes the prosperity and opportunity that economic integration brings, but is far more cautious on anything affecting national identity.

The people of these countries suffered long and hard to keep their own identity under communism. It's little wonder they baulk at abandoning it in favor of mushy multi-culturalism, just because Germany and other elites like it.

The migration issue brings this to a head. Poles and other central Europeans look aghast at the appalling terrorist attacks by Islamist Jihadists in Manchester, London, Paris, Nice, Brussels and Berlin. They conclude that they oppose whatever policies have created these disasters. If that means denying entry into their countries to any categories of migrants that might bring those ideas with them, so be it.

JUST WATCHED Trump heads to summit amid disagreements with G20 nations Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump heads to summit amid disagreements with G20 nations 04:42

The logic goes: if such terrorist phenomena are a result of wider globalization, maybe we should have a bit less of that too?

The Polish government is currently dominated by JarosÃÂaw KaczyÃÂski (whose twin brother Lech was Poland's President when he died in the Smolensk air crash in 2010). KaczyÃÂski is adept at playing with these ideas and framing his policies accordingly.

Plenty of poorer Polish voters living away from the more liberal-minded cities feel marginalized or worried by the economic and cultural results of unrelenting ""integration"". They respond to blatantly patriotic pseudo-conservative slogans: Yes to Poland and everything Polish! Yes to lots more NATO! No to Brussels and Berlin! HELL NO to massed refugees from the Middle East!

In this complex political-psychological situation in Europe, both President Trump and President Putin offer in their very different ways rhetorical cover for defensive, populist instincts.

President Trump may be (to put it politely) quixotic and unpredictable. But he loves to talk in shamelessly sentimental terms about pride in one's country. He likes deals. He likes coal and coal miners -- Poland has coal mines threatened by EU climate policies. His crassly robust, no-nonsense approach to politics and life in general is as far from President Obama's lofty languid liberal detachment as can be imagined.

President Putin by contrast knows that he has nothing positive to offer central and eastern Europeans who have long memories of Soviet oppression. He makes the best of a bad job by offering blandishments for Russia's leadership in upholding conservative civilizational values: No decadence! No namby-pamby gay rights! No compromise with radical Islam!

This of course leads nowhere, but when attached to busy cunning meddling in Western social media it creates uncertainty and mistrust that gnaw away at the very idea of democracy.

In short, Europe finds itself, once again, pondering an uncertain future. Its social-democratic model of international integration represented by the European Union is struggling to hold firm against multiple challenges: mass migration from the Middle East and Africa; Brexit; deep financial stresses in the ill-conceived eurozone.

But above and beyond those acute practical problems, perhaps the very idea of bland liberal supra-nationalism as part of technological globalisation is running out of legitimacy.

Nestle, Europe's most valuable public company, announced a 20 billion Swiss franc ($21 billion) share buyback program last month coupled with a plan to increase leverage and prioritize acquisitions in high-growth areas as it battles slowing demand for packaged food. The move came just two days after the billionaire hedge fund manager urged Nestle to more aggressively improve returns as his Third Point fund revealed a $3.5 billion stake that made it Nestle's eighth-largest shareholder. But Nestle's plan did not address Loeb's calls for it to exit its $26 billion stake in French cosmetics giant L'Oreal (OREP.PA) or set a formal margin target of 18 to 20 percent by 2020, up from 15.3 percent in 2016. Unilever (ULVR.L) and Danone (DANO.PA) have recently set their own respective 2020 margin targets of 20 percent and more than 16 percent. Some analysts now expect Nestle to set, or at least imply, a long-term margin target at its Sept. 26 investor seminar, when new chief executive Mark Schneider will lay out his plans. ""Third Point's stake may add urgency to margin delivery and sharpens focus on the September investor days,"" Liberum analysts said.     Loeb's move on Nestle comes months after Unilever fended off a surprise $143 billion takeover approach from Kraft Heinz (KHC.O). Both events highlight the magnitude of the trouble rocking the packaged food sector, as a new generation of consumers flock to smaller brands, leaving companies racing to improve profits through cost cuts. Nestle has a cost-savings program but has not said how much of this will go toward raising its margins, which are at the low end of its peer group. Improved productivity was first on Third Point's wish list, and the source, who declined to be identified, said it was the most important.  Loeb, dubbed a ""constructivist"" for his increasingly cooperative approach, first met Schneider on June 2, the source said, adding that no other meetings are currently planned before the September seminar, which Third Point plans to attend. Third Point generally agrees with the direction Nestle is heading in under its new CEO, the first outside leader in nearly a century, said the source, but it wants to see greater urgency. Aside from the share buyback, Schneider, who became CEO in January, has already scrapped a long-term sales model and announced a review of Nestle's U.S. confectionery business.  Third Point, which has not commented publicly on Nestle's plans, may give an update in its quarterly letter due later this month, the source said, adding that its plan was to keep sharing its views and talking to the company.  It has suggested that Nestle review its portfolio, which includes more than 2,000 brands including Maggi, Gerber, Perrier and Nescafe. It wants a divestiture of the L'Oreal stake, and has floated an exchange offer whereby Nestle shareholders are offered shares of L'Oreal, maker of Maybelline make-up. Nestle has not commented on this, but behind closed doors, its board does not seem keen, the source said, confirming what another source had previously told Reuters. Nestle, which has owned the stake for more than four decades, has long touted it as strategic and value-creating, and a source last month told Reuters that view had not changed. After carefully assessing all companies in the sector, including Unilever, Third Point started buying Nestle shares earlier this year, when the stock was trading above 70 Swiss francs per share, the source said, noting that Nestle had the greatest opportunity for upside. The shares jumped 4 percent to a record high the day Third Point's letter was disclosed and the stock was trading at 82.90 francs per share at 1559 GMT, up 1.3 percent.  That stands to boost Third Point's performance, which is already outshining its rivals this year. For example, Loeb's Ultra fund, which is invested in Nestle, gained 0.9 percent in June, taking its year-to-date performance to 17.2 percent, said the source.  That compares to an average activist hedge fund performance of 1.27 percent in June and 4.21 percent for the year, according to industry tracker Hedge Fund Research. Since founding Third Point in 1995, Loeb has campaigned for changes at companies such as Yahoo Inc YHOO.O and Sothebys and famously brought his tactics to Japan via now-exited positions in Sony Corp (6758.T) and Seven & I Holdings (3382.T).

""I think President Putin did exactly what we thought he would do, which is deny it,"" Haley said

Washington (CNN) US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley says Russian President Vladimir Putin denied Moscow interfered in last year's US election in order to ""save face.""

""This is Russia trying to save face, and they can't, they can't,"" Haley told CNN's Dana Bash in an interview for ""State of the Union"" that will air in full on Sunday. ""Everybody knows that Russia meddled in our elections. Everybody knows that they're not just meddling in the United States' election. They're doing this across multiple continents, and they're doing this in a way that they're trying to cause chaos within the countries. ""

When asked about what happened behind closed doors during Trump and Putin's highly anticipated face-to-face meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, on Friday, Haley said Trump wanted to look Putin ""in the eye.""

""What he did was bring up right away the election meddling, and he did that for a reason,"" Haley said. ""One, he wanted him (Putin) to basically look him in the eye, let him know that, 'Yes, we know you meddled in our elections. Yes we know you did it. Cut it out.' And I think President Putin did exactly what we thought he would do, which is deny it.""

Asked why, if everyone knows Russia interfered in the US election, Trump hasn't said so in such an unequivocal way publicly, Haley reiterated that Trump's meeting was confrontational.

The European Union imposed the sanctions after Russia's 2014 annexation of the peninsula from Ukraine, a move it sees as breaking international law.  Siemens, which has repeatedly insisted it was not aware the turbines were destined for Crimea, said it would press criminal charges against those responsible for diverting the turbines.  ""Siemens has received information from reliable sources that at least two of the four gas turbine sets, which were delivered for the project in Taman, Southern Russia, have been moved to Crimea against our will,"" it said in a statement.  ""Over the last few months, our customer has confirmed to us numerous times in writing that a delivery to Crimea would not occur. As a consequence, Siemens will initiate criminal charges against the responsible individuals.""  Reuters reported last week that the Siemens turbines had been delivered to Crimea.  A Siemens spokesman said the customer in question was Russian state-owned engineering company Technopromexport, which bought the turbines from Siemens. Technopromexport had no immediate comment, and Russia's energy ministry declined to comment. Vladimir Putin, who is expected to seek reelection as Russian president next year, has vowed to ensure energy security for Crimea, but has no home-grown company that could easily supply such turbines. The Kremlin said on Monday the power turbines being installed in Crimea had been made in Russia using Russian components - an apparent reference to the fact that the turbines were produced at a factory in St. Petersburg. The plant's owner, Siemens Gas Turbine Technologies LLC, is 65 percent owned by Siemens and uses Siemens technology. Siemens - a multinational whose activities include trains,  factory automation and healthcare equipment - will mark 170 years' presence in Russia this year, and invested about 1 billion euros ($1.14 billion) there in the early years of this decade, mostly in energy. Joe Kaeser met Putin several times during his first year as chief executive, including a widely criticized visit to Russia shortly after the annexation of Crimea during which he reaffirmed his commitment to the country. Germany is still one of Russia's top trading partners. A spokesman for the German Economy Ministry, when asked about the Siemens affair on Monday, said that it was up to Siemens to ensure it respected the EU sanctions. The issue has been raised in diplomatic circles in Moscow, a Siemens source familiar with the matter said.  Three sources close to the matter told Reuters last week that Russia's ZAO Interautomatika had been hired to help install the turbines in Crimea. Siemens said on Monday it had expanded investigations by an internal taskforce to all of its Russian-based entities and relevant partners to ensure that no equipment or services could be supplied that could violate export control restrictions. ""This also applies to Siemens' minority stake in Interautomatika,"" it said, adding that Interautomatika had confirmed in writing Siemens' insistence that all relevant activities with respect to Crimea be immediately terminated. Siemens added that it would file lawsuits to halt any further deliveries to Crimea and to return already-dispatched equipment to its original destination. It said it was evaluating what additional actions were possible. The Siemens source had earlier told Reuters that the company was taking legal steps to address the issue.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-train-idUSKBN19V0ZF,NEW YORK COMMUTERS TAKE DISRUPTIVE TRACK REPAIRS IN STRIDE,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Commuters were warned to expect hell going to and from New York City, but on the first day of disruptive repairs at the nation's busiest rail hub on Monday many said their rides were no worse than usual for the crowded, delay-prone transit system. Some, noting the sunny weather, even enjoyed being diverted onto a free, specially arranged ferry across the Hudson River.  The three railroads that carry tens of thousands of people each day to and from Pennsylvania Station in midtown Manhattan have canceled some trains and rerouted others for the eight weeks the work on the tracks is expected to take. Some riders from New Jersey complained about lengthened commutes, while noting they were already used to delays after a string of derailments and stalled trains at the station this year that the repairs are intended to remedy. Many riders and transit officials attributed the relatively smooth start to a successful public awareness campaign, including numerous station attendants who answered questions, handed out pamphlets and herded disoriented passengers. ""Tickets out!"" one attendant bellowed at New Jersey's Hoboken Terminal, on the opposite side of the Hudson River from Manhattan. ""This way to the 39th Street ferry!"" shouted another. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had predicted a ""summer of hell"" for commuters as the repairs continued through to Sept. 1. Bill McLeer, who works in data analysis and was waiting in an unusually subdued Penn Station for a train home to Mount Laurel in New Jersey, called the governor's warning ""completely overblown."" And some commuters relished a free ride on a ferry that normally costs $9.   ""It's my first time,"" said David Lawner, a database administrator from West Orange, New Jersey, as he marveled at the warm breezes of the ferry's open-top deck. ""Isn't this relaxing?""   Another ferry rider, Kathleen Lynn, was less rhapsodic. ""It's going to add 20 minutes,"" said Lynn, a Summit, New Jersey, resident who works in financial services. ""Or an hour. Depends on whether everything hooks up."" Penn Station, an underground maze of low ceilings and mediocre dining spots built in the 1960s, serves about 95,000 New Jersey Transit customers and about 116,000 Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) customers on an average weekday, according to 2016 data. Amtrak, the national passenger rail corporation and the station's owner, says an average of 28,000 rides a day on its intercity services begin or end in Penn Station. The commuter crunch highlights lagging investment in U.S. infrastructure, and especially in New York City, which is dependent on mass transit.  Even so, Amtrak reported most of its trains ran on time or close to it, and the Penn Station departures board showed no delays during the evening rush. ""We've had a good commute this morning,"" Amtrak's president, Charles ""Wick"" Moorman, said in an interview. ""It's the first morning of a long process, but right now we feel good."" Joe Lhota, who oversees the LIRR as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's chairman, praised riders, saying ""they did everything perfect today."" ""Tomorrow is another day, we start afresh,"" he told reporters during the evening rush. ""We're expecting thunderstorms in the morning.""

http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/01/health/sad-clown-standup-comedy-mental-health/index.html,THE SAD CLOWN: THE DEEP EMOTIONS BEHIND STAND-UP COMEDY,"CNN's ""The History of Comedy,"" an original series exploring what makes us laugh and the comedians who've influenced culture, airs Sundays at 10 p.m. ET/PT beginning July 16.

(CNN) Comedians used to tell a joke that goes like this:

""A comedian walks into a psychologist's office. The psychologist says, 'lie down and tell me everything you know.' ""

The punch line: ""I haven't been able to get an appointment since. He's been doing my act in Philadelphia.""

The material that comes from a counselor's couch often makes great fodder for a comic's act. It's the sad clown paradox: The men and women who make people laugh for a living often struggle with mental health challenges offstage that are hardly a laughing matter.

It's unclear how many comedians struggle with mental challenges such as depression, but many of the most familiar names have talked and joked about the issue: Robin Williams, Sarah Silverman, Stephen Fry, Spike Jones, Woody Allen, Richard Pryor, Ellen DeGeneres. It's no accident that the Laugh Factory in Hollywood has an in-house psychologist.

""I despised myself from pretty much close to getting out of the womb,"" comedian Richard Lewis said in the documentary. ""I was always wrong. Let's start with that. When you are always wrong, you seek an audience to disprove that theory.""

It's unclear in scientific literature whether this is true for all comedians. Does one need a mental struggle to be funny? Or is it that some comedians better understand these challenges and can speak to them without experiencing the struggle themselves?

What we do know is that analyzing humor is a lot like dissecting a frog, the old joke goes: No one laughs, and the frog dies. Yet in increasing numbers, scientists are trying to understand what motivates the professional jokers to want to make us laugh, even if they can't always do it for themselves.

The research is laughably contradictory.

Legendary psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud theorized that comedians often tell jokes as a kind of relief system from some kind of anxiety.

More recently, an often-quoted study from 1975 (PDF) theorized that humor can leave the comedian with a feeling of control over a situation in which they would otherwise be powerless.

""One can note here the plethora of jokes about doctors, psychiatrists, undertakers, sex and mothers-in-law,"" study author Samuel James wrote. If a comedian did struggle with their own mental health, the jokes could act like a salve for a physical wound.

That 1975 study focused on 55 full-time comedians who were highly successful. They had national news coverage and had a salary well over six figures. Despite their enormous success, James found, 80% of them had sought some kind of therapy.

The majority of those comedians had a few personality traits in common. They had higher-than-average to well above-average intelligence; other studies have linked high intelligence to depression.

The study participants felt as if they understood themselves fairly well and had good relationships, yet they often felt ""misunderstood, picked on or bullied."" They were also more likely to be ""angry, suspicious and depressed"" compared with those outside that profession.

Humor can also decrease social distance between people.

more often reported being close with their mothers but had more distant and disapproving fathers. Other studies have The comicsmore often reported being closewith their mothers but had more distant and disapproving fathers. Other studies have found the opposite parental relationship in comedians.

study titled Mental illness is often linked to suicide, but scientists agree that despite high-profile cases such as Williams', there isn't a disproportionate number of suicides in the profession. However, comedians don't live as long as their less-funny peers, according to a 2014study titled ""Does comedy kill?"" It merely adds up numbers but doesn't get at the reasons behind them.

From television to film, and from comedy to drama, Williams set a standard that only he could reach. Versatile, boisterous and surprising, his comedic style cracked up and comforted generations. In August 2014, those generations mourned the loss of a comedic genius who changed the way we interpret, think about and enjoy comedy, much like these talents that follow: Hide Caption 1 of 19 Photos: Comedic geniuses who left us too soon We didn't have John Belushi for long, but when we did? It was epic. One of the first ""Saturday Night Live"" stars, Belushi gave us a master class in televised sketch work, rolling out impersonations of everyone from Truman Capote to Elizabeth Taylor. And when Belushi transitioned to the big screen with 1978's ""Animal House,"" his role as the filthy frat boy Blutarsky became a cinema classic. It looked to his amazed fans that Belushi was just getting started, but in his private life the actor was also struggling with substance abuse. In March 1982, he overdosed at the age of 33. Hide Caption 2 of 19 Photos: Comedic geniuses who left us too soon The world still hasn't come to terms with the loss of Andy Kaufman. Given that Kaufman was a sublime comedian and consummate prankster, there are those who still cling to the hope that the actor/performance artist faked his own death. But as far as we know, comedy lost a great in May 1984, when a 35-year-old Kaufman died of a rare form of cancer. Rather than stew on the ""what ifs,"" we'll instead say to Kaufman, ""tank you veddy much."" Hide Caption 3 of 19 Photos: Comedic geniuses who left us too soon Good luck finding a comedian today who doesn't count Richard Pryor as an influence. Unflinchingly honest and as foul-mouthed as he was funny, Pryor's uncanny observations and impeccable delivery turned the Illinois native, who had a notoriously tough childhood, into a legend. He took his talent from the comedy stage to the screen and back again during his career, and still performed even after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1986. Pryor died in December 2005, but his influence as a singularly gifted, uproarious storyteller lives on. Hide Caption 4 of 19 Photos: Comedic geniuses who left us too soon Knowing that we'd never get to see Chris Farley's infectious smile again was very tough to swallow upon his death in 1997. It felt like we'd just gotten to know the uncontainable comedian, who got his start on ""Saturday Night Live"" in 1990. Farley's career hurtled to the top of the comedy food chain, as he became an integral part of ""SNL's"" cast and starred in movies of his own. Yet in his personal life, Farley was struggling with alcohol and substance abuse. The actor, seen here with filmmakers Tyron Montgomery (left) and Thomas Stellmach (right) at the 69th Academy Awards in March 1997, died that December from an overdose. He was 33. Hide Caption 5 of 19 Photos: Comedic geniuses who left us too soon It takes a special kind of creative to dream up the zany world of Pee-wee Herman, as comedic actor/writer Phil Hartman (right) did with Paul Reubens in the '80s. Hartman served as Captain Carl before his memorable work on ""Saturday Night Live."" From there, he built a career that included work on standouts like ""The Simpsons"" and ""NewsRadio."" But tragedy in 1998 brought Hartman's career to an abrupt end; the actor, seen here co-starring with Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1996 movie ""Jingle All The Way,"" was shot to death by his wife, Brynn Hartman, who killed herself hours later. Hide Caption 6 of 19 Photos: Comedic geniuses who left us too soon The death of John Candy was like the death of childhood for many of his fans, who grew up watching him in classic comedies like 1987's ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles."" Candy's rÃÂ©sumÃÂ© reads like a list of pop culture's favorite films: ""Blues Brothers,"" ""Stripes,"" ""National Lampoon's Vacation,"" ""Splash,"" ""Spaceballs"" and ""Home Alone,"" all made between 1980 and 1990, not to mention his ensemble work on the Emmy-winning TV series, ""SCTV,"" or his starring role in 1993's ""Cool Runnings."" His comedy was gentler and more accessible than some of his raunchier brethren, but it was just as enthralling. A prolific actor, Candy, who struggled with his weight throughout his career, was at work on 1994's ""Wagons East"" when he died in his sleep on the set. He was 43. Hide Caption 7 of 19 Photos: Comedic geniuses who left us too soon Bill Hicks was never afraid to deliver a controversial message -- his gift was that he could make you belly laugh while doing so. Hicks' time in the spotlight was brief, but he honed his craft since he was a kid, and grew to be known in the '80s as a dark comedy giant and social critic, with frequent appearances on David Letterman's late-night programs. But before Hicks could gain his footing with an even broader audience, he died of cancer in 1994. He was 32. Hide Caption 8 of 19 Photos: Comedic geniuses who left us too soon It didn't matter if Mitch Hedberg was talking about koala bears or candy bars; when he stepped to the stage, he had your attention. The comedian once dubbed ""the next Seinfeld"" had reached cult status in the late '90s and was approaching mainstream popularity when he died suddenly in March 2005 of a drug overdose at age 37. Hide Caption 9 of 19 Photos: Comedic geniuses who left us too soon Patrice O'Neal is another stand-up comedian whose staunch frankness is missed to this day. At turns brilliant and gleefully brash, O'Neal was a comics' comic -- the kind of sharp storyteller who could enrapture even those who did stand-up for a living. His views and comedy were controversial, to be certain, but they were also a welcome challenge. O'Neal, seen here in September 2011, died from complications of a stroke that November at age 41. Hide Caption 10 of 19 Photos: Comedic geniuses who left us too soon By the time ""The Bernie Mac Show"" made its way to Fox in 2001, the comedy's tart-tongued star had been making audiences laugh for close to a decade, stretching all the way back to HBO's ""Def Comedy Jam."" But that sitcom gave Bernie Mac an even bigger platform for his distinctive delivery, snowballing an already successful career into stardom territory with movies like the ""Ocean's Eleven"" franchise, ""Guess Who"" and ""Transformers."" Mac's seemingly unstoppable rise was cut short in 2008 when the comedian died of complications from pneumonia at the age of 50. Hide Caption 11 of 19 Photos: Comedic geniuses who left us too soon Another original ""Saturday Night Live"" cast member, Gilda Radner, gave us the gift of characters like Roseanne Roseannadanna and her unforgettable spin on Barbara Walters, Baba Wawa. For anyone who thought comedy was a boy's game, Radner was there to prove them wrong, hanging in league with co-stars like John Belushi. Radner was poised to shine on film, with movies like 1982's ""Hanky Panky,"" but she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1986, and passed away three years later at the age of 42. Hide Caption 12 of 19 Photos: Comedic geniuses who left us too soon It's only right that John Ritter signed his autographs ""with love and laughter,"" as that's what he brought to audiences during his decades-long career. With the start of ""Three's Company"" in 1977, Ritter became the roommate everyone wished they had as the secretly hetero Jack Tripper. He starred in movies and did voice work, but it seemed to be the sitcom Ritter loved most. At the time of his shocking death in 2003, Ritter was starring on ABC's ""8 Simple Rules."" His passing, caused by an aortic dissection, felt like a sucker punch for all of us hoping to see his charming smile for years to come. Hide Caption 13 of 19 Photos: Comedic geniuses who left us too soon Madeline Kahn has been called "" a kind of toy person: diminutive, delightful, sexy, impish, cute and capable of squirting vinegar in your eye. '' Or, according to Mel Brooks, ""one of the most talented people that ever lived."" And he would know, as he directed Kahn in four classic films: ""Blazing Saddles"" (pictured here with Harvey Korman), ""Young Frankenstein,"" ""High Anxiety"" and ""History of the World Part 1."" Whether her quirky comedy was featured on Broadway, film or TV, Kahn shone bright. Like, flames. Her light dimmed too soon when she died of ovarian cancer at 57. Hide Caption 14 of 19 Photos: Comedic geniuses who left us too soon Counterculture comedian, social satirist and expletive enthusiast, Lenny Bruce (seen here circa 1965), knew how to talk dirty and influence people. He kept his audience in rapt attention while speaking frankly -- often in a stream of consciousness -- about taboo subjects such as religion, politics and sex. But not everyone was amused. Bruce was arrested several times for obscenity in his act, ultimately leading to a conviction at trial following a 1964 charge. The good news is he was granted a full pardon. The bad news is that it came in 2003, 37 years after Bruce died of a drug overdose in his Hollywood house at the age of 40. Hide Caption 15 of 19 Photos: Comedic geniuses who left us too soon Greg Giraldo was such a talented insult comic, he could eviscerate you on stage or at a roast, and you would probably ask for more so you could revel in his acerbic wit. But in an all-too-familiar story, Giraldo -- a recovering alcoholic -- died of an accidental prescription pill overdose at 44. Fellow comics paid tribute to Giraldo in sincere tweets of mourning (Sarah Silverman and Patton Oswalt) to the appropriately tasteless. At a roast for Jim Florentine shortly after Giraldo's death, roastmaster Rich Vos said, ""I wasn't the first choice to host. Greg Giraldo was asked, but he said he'd rather be dead than host this .""

Gordon Claridge , a psychologist who is retired from the University of Oxford, is still gathering data about comedians to better understand their personalities.

He has found that comedians seem to have two competing personality traits: introverted anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure) and extroverted impulsiveness. Although they are similar to actors, who remain extroverted, open and interested in understanding the world around them, comedians have introverted traits that make them asocial and a little emotionally flat. Some also suffer from clinical depression.

That personality split with their impulsive, extroverted tendencies may be behind their funny perspective on the world.

""We found a rather curious set of conditions out there,"" Claridge said. ""Comedy may partly be a form of self-medication, something we don't see at all with other artists.""

In the CNN documentary, comedian Patton Oswalt agrees: ""A lot of comedians are people that are very introverted, very shy, very sensitive to humiliation. The only way to combat it is to go to the one place where you are stripped bare.""

has limitations in that it focused only on male comedians. Claridge's studyhas limitations in that it focused only on male comedians. Other studies contradict his research, finding that there is no more depression among comedians than non-comics.

Claridge has gathered data about female comedians and will investigate whether they will have similar personality traits.

When he has presented his work to comedians, they've said that his findings were obvious from the people they knew on the circuit.

""My dad's humor came from life, and I don't think Dad had a choice,"" Pryor's daughter Rain Pryor said in the documentary. ""You either laugh your way through it, or you die through it.""

If comedians truly do have competing personality traits, humor may be their way of forcing their introverted selves to interact.

And despite the perception given by comedians like Woody Allen, they are not typically neurotic, studies show. They score high in creativity and openness, although they tend to display lower conscientious and agreeable behavior than other performers (PDF) and writers, and they tend to be more critical and suspicious. This may give them the distance they need to observe human behavior with a comic eye.

A survey of comedians for a study in 2014 found that some standup artists did it largely for what one comedian in the study said was the ""validation via the audience. We are trying to fill a hole."" That research concluded that comics have a kind of ""paradox of identification.""

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-06/if-you-can-t-afford-a-porsche-911-buy-the-mazda-mx-5-rf,Missing,"The Mazda MX-5 RF is not a luxury car.That doesnt mean its inferior. On the contrary, its an affordable toy with some trappings of luxury pared down to size, like a tasty slider on a silver platter. Its not the whole thing, but with this sample size, you still get a satisfying taste of something meaty.If you cant afford the $110,300 Porsche 911 Targa, the German brands legendary see-through hard-top, the $31,555 Mazda MX-5 RF is a logical alternative. Its the best of any in its reasonably priced set.  Mazda introduced the fourth generation of its tiny two-door in 2014. The RF, or retractable fastback version, is new this year.By retractable fastback, Mazda means that the hard top automatically folds back and down under the trunk, flanked by pillar-like beams on either side of the middle of the car. The idea was to make an open-top Miata that would hold the driving thrill of such a nimble, rough-and-ready car while giving it the cachet of a true hardtop. (By cachet, I mean a better, more quality look, a tighter fit to the car, and a quieter interior cabin.) With the top down, it looks kind of like those old T-bar Porsches from the 1970s, which is great.  The hardtop adds 113 pounds to the soft-top original version. What you gain in general practicality and a newly staunch demeanorboth from behind the wheel and from the overall appearance of the carfar outweigh the negligible loss of agility.The caveat here is that, despite the fact that Mazda now offers an automatic version of the MX-5 RF, you must buy the manual 6-speed in order to enjoy the full benefits of its graces. You wouldnt eat a mini-hamburger without any toppings, would you? It needs a little dressing to enhance the flavor.In the same way, the MX-5 RFs four-cylinder, 155 hp engine needs the thrill of a stick shift to activate full enjoyment of the rear-wheel drive. The movement through the gears is crisp, short, and direct. An automatic transmission simply doesnt offer the same driving engagement, and how could it? Its a computer working the car for you. For many buyers, the MX-5 may be the first introduction to a manual transmission and to rear-wheel drive. Its worth doing them together on a vehicle so well-suited to zippy driving: They display their flavor most fully when theyre mixed.This is where Mazda separates itself from the pack ($25,495 Subaru BRZ; $26,255 Toyota 86; $21,600 MINI Hardtop). While those can drag (BRZ) and lurch a bit around corners (MINI), the MX-5 stays light on its feet and connected to the road, with seamless transitions through first, second, and third gear on the way to a 6.1-second 60 mph sprint time. It doesnt have a bracing sprint time, but driving it is fun. (Thats not a word I use to describe many cars, which can be alternately thrilling, angry, fast, smooth, powerful, or any other of dozens of specific descriptors. This one, simply put, is fun.)Its nowhere near as fast as the 4.5-second 911 Targa, but, then, that one costs nearly $80,000 more. Top speed on the MX-5 RF is 135 mph.Here is where the MX-5 actually beats the 911 Targa: At 2,445 pounds compared with the 911s 3,461 pounds, its lithe body imparts such a feeling of ease when you drive it that you really dont think about driving it at all. (This also lends it superior efficiency, at 33 mpg on the highway, to the 911 as well.) It conjures the uncanny duality of being totally engaged (manual transmission, after all) but also freed from the physical constraints that so dearly cling to heavier, larger cars: I know I dont have to mention that parking such a small bauble is a joy. With the MX-5, all those spots that were almost big enough to fit your expensive sedan open up in blessed welcome.The MX-5 RF has some options, though their cost doesnt amount to much more than base MSRP, and many nice thingslike Bluetooth, heated seats, and a 7-inch color touch-screen displaycome free. Brembo front brakes, a rear lip spoiler, 17 forged dark alloy wheels, a rear bumper skirt, and door sill trim plates, add $5,000 or so to the final cost. The MX-5 is more expensive than its nearest competitors, but not by much.So, whats not to like with MX-5 RF? Nothing, really. But dont expect a roof that retracts when the car is traveling at anything more than the most excruciating snails crawl (6 mph and under), and dont expect a throaty engine roar when you hit the gas. Dont expect multi-zone climate control, generous visibility, interior Alcantara finery, or even a back seat. (The trunk makes a great sandwich holder, though.)Do expect to get attention for driving something cool. With angled LED headlights and a reserved front grille and fascia that accentuate its cute trim body and flying buttress-flanked sides, it communicates that its buyer has more discernment than those who own the standard-issue MX-5 Miata.  Call it the sports car in one perfect bite. "

The discovery yields the oldest known collection of Madeira in the United States

(CNN) Museum workers in New Jersey broke through a Prohibition-era wall and a locked wooden cage to discover over 50 bottles and 42 demijohns of rare Madeira wine dating back as early as 1769.

Liberty Hall Museum at Kean University in Union, New Jersey, says the discovery yields the oldest known collection of Madeira in the United States.

""We had no idea the old bottles were there,"" said John Kean, first cousin to New Jersey's former governor and president of the museum. ""We knew there would be wine, but had no idea as to the date. That was a major surprise.""

Historians and museum workers have been renovating Liberty Hall Museum, originally just called Liberty Hall, which was home to New Jersey's first elected governor and signer of the Constitution, William Livingston.

The house was built in 1772, just prior to the American Revolution, and originally had 14 rooms. The estate changed ownership in 1811 to the Kean family and eventually became the 50-house mansion that stands today.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/10/news/economy/tax-reform-deductions/index.html?section=money_topstories,THE DEDUCTIONS THAT MAY BE KILLED BY TAX REFORM,"Real tax reform remains a very big IF. But ... if ... Congress and the Trump administration slash rates and overhaul the tax code, most itemized deductions taxpayers can claim on their tax returns would probably go away.

Why? Because both the White House and House Republicans have proposed getting rid of them except those for mortgage interest and charitable contributions.

Such a change would affect the 30% of federal tax filers who today choose to itemize because their deductions combined exceed the value of their standard deduction (currently, $6,300 for single filers and $12,600 for joint filers).

The vast majority of households making more than $200,000 itemize. And high-income filers get the most value from itemized deductions.

Nevertheless, there's a notable number of itemizers farther down the income scale as well. The Tax Foundation found that itemizers include: 39% of those with adjusted gross incomes between $50,000 and $75,000; 56% of those with AGIs of $75,000 to $100,000, and close to 77% of filers making between $100,000 and $200,000.

Any tax reform the current Congress might pass could entail a big cut in rates and a larger standard deduction. Details are still not set.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said eliminating most itemized deductions would help ensure the rich don't get much, if any, of a net tax cut. But killing itemized deductions would affect a lot of filers in the middle and upper-middle income ranges, too.

Here are some key deductions that could get the ax.

State and local tax deduction

Itemizers are allowed to write off their state and local income taxes or general sales taxes, plus their property taxes. This is largest itemized deduction for all itemizers, who typically live in high-tax states such as New York and California.

There is, however, resistance to getting rid of this deduction from lawmakers in states most affected by it.

Medical expenses

Today you may deduct the amount of your medical expenses that exceed 10% of your adjusted gross income. That's a tough threshold for most people to meet in any given year. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that just 4% of households claim it and their average savings from it amount to less than $1,500 per return.

While tax reform proposals would get rid of this deduction, Republican bills in the House and Senate to repeal-and-replace Obamacare would preserve it and lower the threshold for eligibility.

Investment interest

While interest payments on personal debt (such as credit cards and car loans) are not deductible, interest paid on loans for income-producing investments is.

So getting rid of that deduction would affect anyone who, for instance, buys stocks on margin, according to Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.

Those who would not be affected are those who pay interest on loans to support their businesses. That would still be deductible as a business expense on Schedule C.

Miscellaneous expenses

This is a catch-all category that includes tax preparation fees and unreimbursed employee expenses such as union dues, travel for work or job-related courses. Also: expenses for income-generating hobbies and gambling losses, among others.

So, for instance, today you may be able to deduct the cost of that business trip your employer failed to cover. That option would disappear and you'd have to fight your boss for reimbursement.

But there's a catch to such deductions: Specific rules govern whether any given expense is eligible. And you can only deduct some of the eligible miscellaneous expenses to the extent that, combined, they exceed 2% of your AGI.

Others, such as gambling losses or casualty and theft losses from income-producing properties, are not subject to the 2% threshold."
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britainfire-regulations-insight-idUSKBN19U07B?il=0,SILENCE OVER WHETHER GRENFELL TOWER MATERIALS PASSED SAFETY TEST,"LONDON (Reuters) - The cladding system used on London's Grenfell Tower would only have met British regulatory standards if the two main materials had passed a key safety test together, according to a Reuters analysis of the building code and data on the materials.     Three weeks after the June 14 fire, neither the two companies involved in the cladding on the Grenfell Tower nor the local authority which enforces the building codes have addressed questions from Reuters about whether that test was ever conducted and its outcome. The test is required to show whether both materials when used together were sufficiently resistant to combustion.  Without proof that it had been carried out, the cladding system would not have met building regulations.     The cladding work carried about by Rydon Group Ltd, the main contractor on the 2014-2016 refurbishment of the building, and its subcontractor Harley Facades involved attaching insulation boards to the tower's concrete facade and covering them with aluminum composite panels.      France's Saint Gobain said the insulation used was its brand of polyisocyanurate (PIR) called Celotex RS5000.     The aluminum panels, which had a polyethylene plastic core were called Reynobond PE, and made by New York-based ArconicInc, previously known as Alcoa Inc.     If all the elements of the insulation system had achieved a separate and demanding government standard called ""limited combustibility"", in separate tests, then a combined test would not have been necessary, according to the building regulations.      But Reynobond PE and Celotex did not meet the combustibility test by themselves, according to safety experts and product specifications published by the manufacturers.       This meant that the two materials combined would need to pass another test known as the BS 8414 test, according to the building regulations. This involves setting a fire under a three-storey mock-up of the proposed wall construction.      Both standards, set out in the guidelines to the building code, aim to prevent a fire spreading quickly from inside and up the exterior walls, something that happened at Grenfell Tower.     In a June 29 email, a spokeswoman for Rydon Group Ltd says it met all building regulations but did not say if the BS 8414test stipulated in the building codes had been conducted.        The building control department of the local Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea council (RBKC), which is responsible for checking that the building and plans are consistent with regulations, declined to say if it had checked the tests had been carried out.        Police think the cladding system at Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of last month's fatal fire. They have said they are investigating possible criminal behavior and the role of all the companies involved in the building.      The Department for Communities and Local Government, the government department which is responsible for setting the regulations enforced by building control, has said the cladding system used at Grenfell did not comply with the building rules it oversees. It has not said why and declined to answer detailed questions on its legal reasoning.    (Link to graphic of Grenfell Tower cladding system:tmsnrt.rs/2t97Ugs)            The test used to assess combined materials must be commissioned from a government approved independent testing agency. Reuters was unable to determine which, if any lab was used.     Rydon, which had a turnover of 249 million pounds last year,  told Reuters the materials it used were suitable for use in tall buildings.     Laboratory testing of the fire resistance of the cladding system used at Grenfell Tower was carried out prior to installation. Please see attached BBA certificate, the spokeswoman said in the June 29 email.     The certificate Rydon provided showed the panels met a separate standard on the surface spread of fire.      Asked specifically about the BS 8414 test, the Rydon spokeswoman said: More technical questions would be better directed at Harley as its their area of expertise.     Executives and a spokesman at Harley, a small company with few assets, declined to comment for this story. It said in a statement on its website last month it was not aware of any link between the fire and the exterior cladding to the tower.     An official at RBKC, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, declined to provide details of the specification it approved or what checks it conducted to ensure the actual construction met the approved plan, citing the ongoing police investigation into the fire.     A spokeswoman for Saint Gobain said its BR 135combustibility certification of Celotex was based on tests conducted with a non-combustible cement façade panel. She declined to say if Celotex had ever passed the BS 8414 test with a flammable façade panel such as Reynobond PE.

As the light brightens, the shower tap opens and the water reaches the desired warmth just as the first whiff of espresso wafts in from the kitchen down the hall.The device is guiding not only how the power is being used, but also where and how its being generated. Since its gusty in Scotland, this mornings supply is coming from tethered drones that turn wind into electricity and send it down a patchwork of interconnected local grids that can operate outside the old network with the swipe of a finger. The forecast is for calm up north, so solar panels down south in Spain will pick up the slack in the afternoon.The best part is the bill, which greater competition and efficiency has driven down to just 5 pounds a month, wired automatically to a Google Inc. unit that aggregates and distributes power based on algorithms that learn from inputs like targeted usage and tolerance for non-renewable sources. A Tesla Inc. battery tucked in a closet and fed by a photovoltaic module on the balcony kicks in when fully charged, providing self-sufficiency for days at a time.Fully smart systems that optimize each stage of the process are evolving the world over, but nowhere are utilities embracing the transition more urgently than in Europe, where political leaders and regulators view man-made climate change as settled science. Beyond the environment, at stake is the fate of an industry thats rushing to shed an outdated business model and fend off deep-pocketed disrupters like Google and Amazon.com Inc., as well as upstarts anxious to capitalize on a new generation of ecologically conscientious consumer.The conventional utility model is dying, says Peter Terium, chief executive officer of Innogy SE, a unit of Essen, Germany-based RWE AG. If you dont adapt now, its hard to see how youre going to survive.RWE is one of two major European utilities to separate its traditional, commodities-based business from its renewables or network businesses in the past 18 months. In both cases the more technology-focused company immediately became more valuable. Innogys market value, about 19 billion euros ($21.6 billion), is almost double RWEs, while EON SE is worth almost triple its new Uniper unit, which represents the German utilitys conventional coal, natural gas generation and commodities trading business.In part its a bet on the view that in the future, as the proliferation of renewables and technology makes it possible to produce power on a smaller, cleaner scale, the money wont be in big power plants anymore. The future of energy will look more like customer-focused data management, an area where tech companies already excel.The trend was reflected in a global survey of industry executives that PriceWaterHouseCoopers LLP conducted two years ago, when more than half said they wouldnt rule out descending into a corporate death spiral.Though theyve diversified into other areas, most integrated utilities still get a large part of their revenues by burning fossil fuels at massive power plants and selling the energy, iterations of Thomas Edison-built stations that first came online in the 19th century. But between now and 2040, 72 percent of the $10.2 trillion the world will spend to add capacity will go toward doubling renewables share of the mix to about one-third, Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates in an outlook published last week.Driving the change are millennials, a generation of people who reached adulthood in the early 21st century and are demanding both cleaner energy and better ways to use it. For EON, venture capitalism is a way forward. The company, which like RWE is based in Essen, was an early investor in Thermondo GmbH, a Berlin start-up that bills itself as hastening the switch to a newer, more decentralized energy system with lower carbon emissions. Thermondo, which started as an online boiler brokerage, has since expanded into solar, fuel cells and will offer home batteries in the future. It now has 150 workers and has served 6,000 customers.As carbon-free generation increases and companies like Tesla Inc. and Daimler AG improve battery storage and efficiency, microgrids are starting to eat away at the old utility model. By 2040, half of Europes electricity supply will come from variable renewables, BNEF estimates show. Decentralized energy, the kind that weakens demand for big power plants, will account for a third of the capacity in Germany by the same year, the outlook shows.Technology is also winning government support. At one of Britains latestpower auctions, a held to prevent electricity blackouts, a record 2.7 percent of new capacity was awarded to tech companies. What Boston-based EnerNOC Inc. and other winners offered was software that finds more efficient ways to turn off or delay extraneous power usage.One millennial, 27-year-old Simon Phelan, quit his job at Jon Moultons Better Capital PCC Ltd. in London to start his own version of Thermondo called Hometree Marketplace Ltd.Hometree, which raised 2.5 million pounds from Moulton and other investors, declined investment offers from five major European utilities, Phelan said, without naming them.He has already convinced fellow millennial Ed Ward, who turned to Hometree out of frustration with his longtime provider, British Gas.BG was trying to give me a boiler that was too massive, as if I wanted to add a million stories to my house, Ward said. Why would I need that?A spokeswoman for British gas, Bieneosa Ebite, said the company works with leading manufacturers to offer choice to its customers and only installs energy-efficient boilers so customers use less energy and save money.British Gass parent company, Centrica Plc, has already sold at least 500,000 units of its Hive device, which controls heating and lighting either manually or by voice. Centrica says the Hive learns and can sometimes warn owners of a looming boiler breakdown. It said it could get 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) in sales from the connected home unit by 2022. Gross segment revenue for the division was 33 million pounds last year.The devices success prompted Hometrees Phelan to poach Andreu Tobella, head of product for Hive, from Centrica last year.Incumbents like EON and British Gas have several institutional advantages over tech giants and start-ups, most notably scores of engineers who can reliably solve customer problems like gas leaks an power outages, according to Elchin Mammadov, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in London. But what Google, Amazon and the other tech companies that are moving into distribution -- and possibly even generation -- do have is climate awareness and cutting edge software, which may be two major selling points for millennials.Anything thats new, anything related to technology that they can try, they will, said Karla McCormick, an assistant professor who tracks consumer trends at Florida State University in Tallahassee. And what a company stands for is huge. If they dont agree with what a company stands for, they wont trust it."

Beheadings are not uncommon in Somalia, where the extremists carry them out on people who are believed to be enemies and to terrorize local populations.This East Africa country has seen an increase in attacks claimed by al-Shabab in recent weeks, posing a security threat ahead of next month's presidential election.Al-Shabab has vowed retribution on Kenya for sending troops in 2011 to Somalia to fight the group, which last year became the deadliest Islamic extremist group in Africa.Saturday's attack occurred in the Pandaguo area, where al-Shabab fighters engaged security agencies in a daylong battle three days ago. A police report said about 15 al-Shabab fighters attacked Jima village and seized men, killing them with knives.Al-Shabab in recent months has increased attacks in Kenya with homemade bombs, killing at least 46 people in Lamu and Mandera counties.The increase in attacks presents a huge problem for Kenya's security agencies ahead of the Aug. 8 presidential election, said Andrew Franklin, a former U.S. Marine who is a security analyst. On election day security agencies will be strained while attempting to stop any possible violence and al-Shabab could take advantage, he said.There was no immediate government comment on the latest attack.Acting Interior Minister Fred Matiangi issued a dusk-to-dawn curfew for parts of Garissa, Tana River and Lamu counties. Mandera County already was under a curfew following earlier al-Shabab attacks. All are close to the Somali border.President Uhuru Kenyatta has not issued any statement on the recent surge in al-Shabab attacks.Kenya is among five countries contributing troops to an African Union force that is bolstering Somalia's fragile central government against al-Shabab's insurgency. Of the troop-contributing countries, Kenya has borne the brunt of retaliatory attacks from al-Shabab.___Associated Press writer Abdi Guled in Hargeisa, Somalia, contributed to this report."
http://cnn.com/2017/07/06/entertainment/asian-actors-hollywood/index.html,"BEYOND 'NERDS' AND 'NINJAS,' SLOW PROGRESS FOR ASIAN ACTORS IN HOLLYWOOD","(CNN) Like any actor, Lewis Tan likes to play the central character in a story.

""Asian actors want to play the lead, the romantic character, the hero, just like everyone else,"" Tan told CNN.

And like most Asian and Asian American actors, Tan has had to battle stereotypes.

""We're cast as ninjas, monks, nerds, the third, fourth, fifth best friend who is a nerd, killers, doctors and for women, the sexy Asian woman who's dating a white guy,"" Tan quipped.

The actor, who is of Chinese, Singaporean and British descent, most recently starred as Zhou Cheng in the Netflix series ""Iron Fist.""

The action-packed show follows the adventures of a martial artist who possesses a mystical force.

Yet the central role went to white actor, Finn Jones, to the dismay of some viewers who wanted to see Tan in the part even though the character in the comic ""Iron Fist"" isn't Asian.

Regardless, Tan considers his role on the show a win.

""It's an exciting time in a lot of ways because things are opening up,"" Tan said. ""There was a time when things weren't as open for [Asian actors], so it's exciting for me to see actors being booked and called in for roles.""

To date, the call for increased diversity in the film and television industry has primarily focused on opportunities for African American, Latino and LGBT creatives, with artists of Asian descent somewhat ignored.

That felt evident to some at the 2016 Academy Awards.

Even as #OscarsSoWhite took center stage, host Chris Rock made a joke using three Asian child actors that resulted in two dozen Asian members of the Academy crafting an open letter demanding an apology.

""In light of criticism over #OscarsSoWhite, we were hopeful that the telecast would provide the Academy a way forward and the chance to present a spectacular example of inclusion and diversity,"" the letter read. ""Instead, the Oscars show was marred by a tone-deaf approach to its portrayal of Asians.""

There has been some notable progress with portrayals in Aziz Ansari's critically acclaimed Netflix series ""Master of None"" and ABC's sitcom-hit ""Fresh Off The Boat,"" but other projects showcase the challenges many Asian performers still face.

Actors Daniel Dae Kim and Grace Park departed the CBS drama ""Hawaii Five-0"" last week over a reported pay disparity between the actors and their white co-stars.

""The path to equality is rarely easy,"" Kim wrote in a Facebook post about leaving the show. ""But I hope you can be excited for the future. I am.""

""As an Asian American actor, I know first-hand how difficult it is to find opportunities at all, let alone play a well developed, three dimensional character like Chin Ho,"" he also said. ""I will miss him sincerely.""

Tan, who spoke to CNN prior to Kim and Park leaving their show, said while he'd like to see even more opportunities for actors of Asian descent, he applauds the inclusion of people of color period.

""I want to see everyone rise,"" he said. ""I think we all will have our time, if we push it, if we do the work and if we make our voices heard."""
http://cnn.com/2017/07/11/politics/donald-trump-russia-controversies-dominate-again/index.html,DONALD TRUMP RUSSIA CONTROVERSIES DOMINATE AGAIN,"Washington (CNN) Any hope that President Donald Trump's direct talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin about Russia's interference in the 2016 election might help get him and the White House out from under the mountain of suspicion he has faced since coming into office had evaporated by Monday afternoon -- and got buried by Monday night.

The political points he might have earned were quickly knocked off the board as he and a string of top aides acquiesced to the Kremlin's claims that Trump accepted Putin's denial of election interference. (Only the president's chief of staff Reince Priebus, who was not present for the Putin meeting, refuted the Kremlin account.) By Monday night, the White House once again found itself firmly under the storm of Russia controversies after a series of New York Times reports tied Trump's eldest son to alleged Russian government attempts to influence the election.

By the time the White House's No. 2 spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders stepped up to the podium Monday, concerns over the Trump-Putin meeting were amplified by the revelation that the president's eldest son had met during the campaign with a Russian lawyer whom the younger Trump was told had dirt on Trump's Democratic rival, according to the Times.

The Times reported later Monday that the younger Trump was told in an email before the meeting that the information was derived from a Russian government effort, citing three people with knowledge of the email. A lawyer for Trump Jr. Called it ""much ado about nothing.""

The White House tried to veer away from those controversies, drawing attention to administration nominees they say Senate Democrats are blocking and presenting a rosy picture of efforts to rally Senate Republicans around health care reform legislation.

But the Russia controversies once again commanded the spotlight.

Kremlin questions pile up

Sanders -- speaking once again off-camera -- was deluged with questions that underscored the rollicking 72 hours of fallout from Trump's encounter with the Russian leader, a period marked by clashing accounts of that meeting, eyebrow-raising Trump tweets and criticism from fellow Republicans aimed squarely at Trump.

Following the treasury secretary and national security adviser's lead, Sanders declined to contradict the Kremlin's account that Trump ""accepted"" Putin's denial of election-meddling.

""The President heard Putin's denial,"" Sanders said. ""He heard his answer and he moved forward with places that they thought they could work together.""

The lack of pushback on the Kremlin's account sent a stark message from the White House: That Putin's denials are at least on par with the US intelligence community's conclusions that Putin directed a campaign to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.

And Sanders again opened the door to the ""impenetrable Cyber Security Unit"" that Trump raised and killed in the space of a day on Twitter amid widespread criticism from Republicans like Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who mocked the irony of collaborating with Russia on cybersecurity.

""Discussions may still take place,"" Sanders said, after noting the ""need to have conversations with our adversaries.""

And after a brief attempt to swat away criticism surrounding the revelation that Donald Trump, Jr. had met -- alongside Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort -- with a Russian lawyer, Sanders said she'd have nothing further to add on the matter.

That story is not likely to be short-lived. It has already prompted calls from members of Congress for further scrutiny and is likely to add to the pile of Russia-related questions that Trump's nominee for FBI Director Christopher Wray will face Wednesday when he heads to Capitol Hill for his first confirmation hearing.

The barrage of questions on Russia-related matters was nothing new to a White House that has been buried week-after-week by developments in the investigation into ties between Trump campaign associates and Russia, and scrutiny over Trump's relatively amiable posture toward Russia.

And once again, the barrage was also a sign of a missed opportunity.

""If Trump had said to Putin -- and afterwards to the public -- that interference is absolutely unacceptable, that we won't allow it and will take steps to prevent it in the future, he might have begun to get ahead of this issue. But he bungled it badly,"" said Stephen Sestanovich, a Columbia University professor who served as ambassador-at-large for the former Soviet Union in the Clinton administration.

""By showing he can't handle Putin, he may even have made his problem worse,"" said Sestanovich, also a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Trump tweets, but not seen

Trump, meanwhile, remained behind closed doors on Monday -- continuing to avoid the press after he bucked the precedent set by the last two presidents and declined to hold a news conference at the G20 summit.

He did take to Twitter -- not to reaffirm his support for the US intelligence community's assessment of Russian meddling -- but to say he and Putin discussed the Democratic National Committee's refusal to turn over its hacked server to the FBI for inspection.

The latest drop in what's become a squall of Russia-related controversies once again clouded the White House's efforts to make progress on policy fronts.

As the Senate returned from recess facing daunting odds of passing health care reform, the White House was once again mired in controversy rather than working to publicly sell the health care bill.

But even as the number of Senate Republicans opposed to the health care bill backed by the White House rose to 10 after senators returned home to face their constituents, Trump had no public events on his schedule Monday and is not expected to make a public push on health care before leaving for France later this week.

The lack of any public advocacy from the president came even as the White House's director of legislative affairs Marc Short said Monday that ""there's more we could do to educate the public.""

""It's a fair point that the Democrats were more organized in their messaging on the bill than collectively Republicans have been,"" Short said, acknowledging the current bill's abysmal approval rating.

The lackluster public engagement from the President -- who has continued to speak directly with Senate Republicans, according to White House officials -- has left many Republicans scratching their heads or questioning Trump's commitment to the legislation's passage.

Doug Heye, the former communications chief to former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, noted that Trump could ""be very influential"" in pressuring several GOP opponents of the current bill who represent states he won handily in 2016 if he headed to those states to boost the health care bill, similarly to how President Barack Obama rallied support for the Affordable Care Act before it passed.

""The only dynamic between where we are now and the past Republican struggles to pass any healthcare legislation is that we've got a Republican in the White House,"" said Heye, a CNN political commentator. ""Whether that's Donald Trump or Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio -- that should be enough. If there's a fully engaged effort, that should be enough to get it over the finish line.""

Trump has held some public events at the White House to push the health care bill, he has held no public events outside the White House aimed solely on selling the legislation and raising pressure on fellow Republicans.

While White House officials considered such rallies to push the health care bill, a White House official told CNN aides to the president moved away from that idea -- seeking to put some distance between the president and the increasingly unpopular bill."
http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/08/us/man-proposes-while-arrested-trnd/index.html,MAN PROPOSES TO GIRLFRIEND WHILE ARRESTED,"(CNN) An Oklahoma couple is showing the world that ""through thick and thin"" starts before marriage.

Police officers were arresting Brandon Thompson, 35, at his Muskogee home on July 4 when he made an odd request. He wanted to propose to his girlfriend, Leandria Keith. A police body camera caught the moment Thompson got down on one knee.

""I didn't want to part ways with her not showing exactly how I feel for her,"" Thompson told CNN by phone. ""I want her to be my wife for the rest of my life.""

'You want to do what?'

The family was celebrating Thompson's birthday and Independence Day -- which fall on the same day -- in their front yard when police officers showed up. Officer Bob Lynch had seen Thompson earlier in the day and recognized him from the several felony warrants out for his arrest, so he followed him to the home.

The officers were in the process of detaining Thompson in the front yard when the suspect made his request.

""I asked the officer if I could propose,"" said Thompson. ""The officer said, 'You want to do what?' and I said, 'I want to propose to her.'""

Lynch and his partner, Officer Lincoln Anderson, agreed to let him do it.

""It took us by surprise that he asked if he could do it,"" Anderson, who is also the Muskogee police spokesman, told CNN via Facebook.

The bodycam video shows Thompson asking his mother if he should ""do it now"" and told her to get the ring. That is when he got down on one knee.

""I love you,"" Thompson is heard saying. ""Will you be my wife, please?""

Keith said yes. The officer wearing the bodycam is then seen switching Thompson's handcuffed hands from his back to his front so he could place the engagement ring on Keith's finger.

""I was shocked,"" Keith told CNN.

The couple has been together since May 2016. They told CNN they will set a date for their wedding once Thompson's legal troubles are resolved.

""When you're in love with somebody and you know that you want to spend the rest of your life with them, you just want them to know how you feel,"" said Thompson. ""I wanted a new start for me and with the police taking me to jail I didn't have to worry about my warrants anymore.""

'I'm tired of running'

Brandon Edward Thompson, 35, proposed to his girlfriend while being arrested.

Thompson said he has been ""doing a lot to turn his life around."" He has been coaching a peewee football team, which gives him an opportunity to give back to the community, he said.

""So many young kids grow up without fathers and don't have the correct type of guidance,"" said Thompson. ""I've been down that road before. I don't want them to make the same mistakes I've made.""

Muskogee County District Court documents show Thompson had six felony warrants out for his arrest. Anderson told CNN that the bench warrants were for failure to appear in court or failure to pay.

""He told me two weeks before, 'Mama, can I come home because I'm tired of running,'"" Thompson's mother, Judy Peal, told CNN. ""When the police arrived I told him, 'Place your hand in your mother's hand and we'll walk out.'""

The bodycam video shows Thompson promising his mother and new fiancÃÂ©e that he will turn his life around and ""get a job.""

Keith pulled the couple's savings together to bail Thompson out of jail. He was released the day after his arrest.

Thompson's next court appearance will be July 17.

'Police officers are human'

Anderson says he hopes that allowing Thompson to propose will show people the human side of policing.

""We all want to see someone get their life on track,"" said Anderson. ""Hopefully it will help him make the choices it will take to support his future wife and his kids. And if by letting him take a moment before going to jail to do what he did, then we did our jobs.""

Peal told CNN the police officers were ""wonderful"" for letting her son propose to Keith while under arrest.

""Police officers are human. We care about the city we serve and the people in it,"" said Anderson. ""Sometimes the smallest gesture of kindness is the biggest influence in someone's life."""

A large shock such as recession or war is usually required.Thats generally been the case for the 14 similar low volatility regimes since 1928, at least in equity markets, Goldman Sachs strategists Christian Mueller-Glissmann and Alessio Rizzi said. These periods on average lasted nearly two years, featured short-lived spikes and realized S&P 500 volatility was usually at or below 10.Swings picked up across assets in the past week and investors are positioning for a shift higher, in part because of fears of central bank tightening, the strategists wrote in a July 3 report. But a sustained breakout is unlikely without an escalation in uncertainty or recession risk, they said.Volatility spikes have been hard to predict as they often occur after unpredictable major geopolitical events, such as wars and terror attacks, or adverse economic or financial shocks and so-called unknown unknowns (e.g. Black Monday in 1987), London-based Mueller-Glissmann and Rizzi said. Recessions and a slowing business cycle have historically resulted in a high vol regime across assets.Goldman Sachs puts the chances of a recession in the next two years at 25 percent.Low volatility isnt unusual and tends to stem from a favorable macroeconomic backdrop with strong growth but anchored inflation and rates, similar to a Goldilocks scenario, Mueller-Glissmann and Rizzi said. Markets have reflected this since January, with equities reaching record highs, strong global growth and declining bond yields, they said.The risk investors face near-term is a consolidation but no transition to sustained high volatility, and to guard against this, Mueller-Glissmann and Rizzi recommend protection through put spreads."

Trump's pledge came during a working session of the G20 summit of world leaders in Hamburg, providing a ""godsend"" to the United Nations' World Food Programme, the group's executive director, David Beasley, told Reuters on the sidelines of the meeting. ""We're facing the worst humanitarian crisis since World War Two,"" said Beasley, a Republican and former South Carolina governor who was nominated by Trump to head the U.N. agency fighting hunger worldwide. The new funding brings to over $1.8 billion aid promised by the United States for fiscal year 2017 for the crises in the four countries, where the United Nations has estimated more than 30 million people need urgent food assistance. ""With this new assistance, the United States is providing additional emergency food and nutrition assistance, life-saving medical care, improved sanitation, emergency shelter and protection for those who have been affected by conflict,"" USAID said in a statement. Rob Jenkins, acting head of the USAID's bureau of democracy, conflict and humanitarian assistance, said of the funding, over $191 million would go to Yemen, $199 million to South Sudan, $121 million to Nigeria and almost $126 million for Somalia. Conflict in all four countries had made it difficult to reach some communities in need of food, he noted. ""We're in a dire situation right now,"" said Jenkins, adding that USAID was also concerned with the situation in southern Ethiopia. ""The situation in southern Ethiopia fortunately does not rise to the dire situation of the other four, but the situation is deteriorating and might very well be catastrophic without additional interventions,"" he said, adding that Washington had already provided some $252 million this year to Ethiopia, ""but the needs continue to grow."" Beasley said the U.S. funding was about a third of what the WFP estimated was required this year to deal with urgent food needs in the four countries in crisis as well as in other areas. The WFP estimates that 109 million people around the world will need food assistance this year, up from 80 million last year, with 10 of the 13 worst-affected zones stemming from wars and ""man-made"" crises, Beasley said. ""We estimated that if we didn't receive the funding we needed immediately that 400,000 to 600,000 children would be dying in the next four months,"" he said. Trump's announcement came after his administration proposed sharp cuts in funding for the U.S. State Department and other humanitarian missions as part of his ""America First"" policy. Beasley said the agency had worked hard with the White House and the U.S. government to secure the funding, but Trump would insist that other countries contributed more as well. A WFP spokesman said Germany recently pledged an additional 200 million euros for food relief. Additional reporting by Lesley Wroughton in Washington; editing by John Stonestreet"

SAN DIEGO -- San Diego firefighters who helped deliver a child in Sorrento Mesa received a visit Thursday from the newborn and his grateful parents.

According to the San Diego Fire-Rescue Department, Tom Judge was driving wife Sydney to a hospital around 9:30 p.m. on June 12 when she told him to pull over and call 911 because the baby was coming. Firefighters and paramedics from a nearby station responded to a commercial area at Oberlin Drive and Scranton Road, where the Judges were waiting.

Heston was delivered in the back seat of the Judge's car. He and Sydney were then taken by ambulance to Sharp Mary Birch Hospital.

She said they didn't realize how close they were to a fire station.

Vivendi, meanwhile, is unhappy with recent politically charged comments by Cattaneo that didnt meet the companys standards, the people said. Cattaneo may leave Telecom Italia after reporting first-half results on July 27, two of the people said.Flavio CattaneoA spokesman for Milan-based Telecom Italia denied there were tensions between Cattaneo and Vivendi and said there arent any discussions with the French media conglomerate about the CEOs departure. A spokesman for Vivendi also denied any strain in the relationship with Cattaneo.Vivendi aims to name its chief convergence officer, Amos Genish, as one of the executives to run Telecom Italia, though he wont be CEO, one of the people said. Naming Genish, a Brazilian, as general manager, with all the powers necessary to lead the company, would be less politically problematic than appointing him as CEO, since hes not Italian.Genish has a successful track record as a telecom executive, most recently as CEO of Telefonica SAs Brazilian unit. Before that, he was co-founder and CEO of GVT Holding SA, a Brazilian telecommunications company that was controlled by Vivendi for a time.Cattaneos contract calls for him to get about 40 million euros ($45.6 million) in shares and cash if he leaves the company, according to a special award clause he arranged with the company when he was hired as CEO.No final decisions have been made, and Cattaneo and Vivendi could resolve their differences and decide he should stay as Telecom Italias chief, the people said.In the last few weeks, Cattaneo and Telecom Italia clashed with the Italian government over telecommunications coverage in rural areas. The government engaged Open Fiber, a joint venture between Italys state lender CDP and Enel SpA, to build a new national fiber network.Telecom Italia is competing in the ultra-broadband segment in rural areas through a project called Cassiopea, a plan that could damage the governments effort to boost local investments, Claudio De Vincenti, minister for territorial cohesion and southern Italy, said in an interview last month with Corriere della Sera.In a hearing June 28, Cattaneo told lawmakers that public tenders for fiber networks in rural areas have been designed to ensure victories for Open Fiber. Italys minister for Economic Development Carlo Calenda called Cattaneos comments were unacceptable.Vivendi, which owns about 24 percent of Telecom Italia, recently won European Union approval to control the phone carrier and installed its CEO, Arnaud de Puyfontaine, as executive chairman of the former Italian monopoly in early June. The Paris-based company, led by billionaire Vincent Bollore, is pushing to create the dominant media group in southern Europe, with assets including pay-TV provider Canal Plus and record label Universal Music Group.Telecom Italia shares have declined about 16 percent since Cattaneo took the helm in March 2016, despite moves by the former chief of power network operator Terna SpA to trim costs and invest in more lucrative broadband services."
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-jawbone-failure-idUSKBN19V0BS,JAWBONE'S DEMISE A CASE OF 'DEATH BY OVERFUNDING' IN SILICON VALLEY,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Consumer electronics company Jawbone had more than enough money to take on Fitbit and other health-tracking devices in the ""wearables"" market.  That may have ended up being its biggest problem. Top-tier venture capital firms Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, Khosla Ventures and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and then a sovereign wealth fund, invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Jawbone, lifting its valuation to $3.2 billion in 2014. Ultimately, all that money couldn't save San Francisco-based Jawbone, which began liquidating proceedings in June after its fitness-tracker product failed to take off. It now ranks as the second largest failure among venture-backed companies, based on total funding raised, according to the research firm CB Insights. Jawbone's fall after raising more than $900 million provides a stark example of how the flood of cash pouring into Silicon Valley can have the perverse effect of sustaining companies that have no future, technology executives and financiers say. The irony is Jawbone could have been a suitable acquisition target some years ago, these people say, had it just kept its valuation lower by raising less money from venture capital and sovereign wealth funds.  ""They are basically force-feeding capital into these companies,"" said Sramana Mitra, a tech entrepreneur and consultant, and founder and CEO of startup accelerator One Million by One Million. ""I expect there will be a lot more deaths by overfunding."" The Jawbone case also underscores the risks that non-traditional startup investors such as sovereign wealth funds face as they ramp up investments in Silicon Valley. The Kuwait Investment Authority led a $165 million investment in Jawbone just last year, when its prospects had already dimmed to the point that most of its original investors were unwilling to put up new funding. These funds, which mange funds of hundreds of billions of dollars, invested $12.7 billion in private tech companies last year, up from $2.2 billion the year before, according to CB Insights. Startup failures are not uncommon, but a billion-dollar company that has raised huge pools of money going belly up remains a rarity. Jawbone ranks behind the solar technology company Solyndra, which became the largest failure among venture-backed companies when it filed for bankruptcy in 2011.  Other recent big-dollar failures include used car marketplace Beepi, which closed after raising about $150 million.  Some investors say failures like Jawbone won't seriously dent startup funding in the near term. Venture capitalists last year raised $41 billion, a record.  ""Everyone is trying to find a way to play in the tech economy,"" said Rich Wong, a partner with Accel venture firm. ""It's inevitable"" that there will be big-ticket failures. But the Jawbone situation could give pause to investors considering nine-figure investments in unproven firms, say venture capitalists.  Since Jawbones downround last year, a number of other startups - including human resources software firm Zenefits, food subscription company HelloFresh and ride service Ola - have had their valuations slashed because of poor performance and waning investor enthusiasm, contributing to heightened caution in the startup industry over the last several months.  The quarterly number of startup financing deals continues to drop from its high in 2015, although with so much cash, investors arent shy to write large checks for the select companies they believe will succeed. Ride-services firm Lyft, for instance, raised $600 million in April. Jawbone's liquidation was first reported last week by technology news site The Information and independently confirmed by Reuters. A spokesman for Jawbone declined to comment. Co-founder and chief executive Hosain Rahman did not respond to email from Reuters, and its VC investors declined to comment.  Alex Asseily, Jawbone's co-founder who resigned as board chairman and director in January 2015, told Reuters ""it's saddening to see Jawbone end this way.""         Jawbone launched in 1999 under the name AliphCom. It cycled through several products, including Bluetooth headsets and speakers, and in 2011 landed on stylish wearable devices to track exercise, sleep and other health data. Along the way, Jawbone burned through more than $500 million in equity and raised more than $400 million in debt, the lion's share from BlackRock, according data provider PitchBook Inc. But the company barely made a dent in the wearables market, with well below five percent market share, and was vastly outperformed by Fitbit, Samsung and others, according to analyst Jitesh Ubrani of International Data Corp.  Still, Jawbone raised $147 million in September 2014, bumping its valuation $3.2 billion, according to Pitchbook. In November of the following year, Jawbone laid off 15 percent of its staff amid financial troubles. By December 2015, BlackRock had marked down the company's shares by 69 percent, according to Pitchbook.  Then, in 2016, the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) invested in Jawbone for the first time, leading a $165 million round that halved Jawbone's valuation to $1.5 billion. The KIA did not respond to requests for comment. Sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East and Asia have in recent years become far more active in investing directly in start-ups, rather than simply investing in venture capital funds.  Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and the Qatar Investment Authority, for instance, both have big stakes in Uber.  Because they have so much more money than traditional venture firms and are less experienced as tech investors, sovereign wealth funds are often called upon to co-invest or lead a risky funding round, say people who invest alongside these foreign funds. Such large fundraising rounds can ""create this artificially bloated valuation that doesn't compute with the revenue,"" Mitra said. They can also be a false signal to investors, who often look at how much money a company has raised as a signal of its success, when ""in fact, it's the opposite,"" said Rebecca Lynn, a partner at Canvas Ventures. Jawbone tried to sell itself in 2016, but was unable to find a buyer, according to investors with knowledge of the matter. It has been sued by vendors who allege the company owes them hundreds of thousands of dollars. Reporting by Heather Somerville; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Edward Tobin"
http://cnn.com/2017/07/05/americas/venezuela-indepedence-day-clashes/index.html,VENEZUELAN LAWMAKERS INJURED IN CLASH AT NATIONAL ASSEMBLY,"(CNN) Armed with pipes, sticks and stones, supporters of embattled Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro stormed the country's National Assembly in Caracas Wednesday and attacked opposition lawmakers, witnesses said.

The Independence Day clashes in the opposition-controlled chamber were the latest outbreak of violence in a country struggling with a deepening economic crisis and sometimes bloody street protests calling for a change of government.

Video and images from the scene showed government supporters -- some wearing bandanas and carrying Venezuela's tricolor flag -- storming the assembly building and pushing open its massive wooden doors.

Inside, blood stained the floors and walls of the assembly hall as wounded lawmakers were tended to by colleagues.

Venezuelan lawmakers Luis Stefanelli, left, and Jose Regnault stand in a corridor of the National Assembly after Wednesday's crash with demonstrators in Caracas.

At least seven legislative employees and five lawmakers were injured, according to National Assembly President Julio Borges.

Journalists inside the assembly building said they had also been assaulted.

The US State Department issued a statement Wednesday night calling the clash ""an assault on the democratic principles cherished by the men and women who struggled for Venezuela's independence 206 years ago today.""

The statement called on the Venezuelan government ""to immediately provide for the protection of the National Assembly, ensure those injured in today's attack are able to receive medical attention, and bring the attackers to justice.""

Opposition lawmaker Americo De Grazia is led away by bodyguards and a National Assembly employee after he was injured by government supporters.

Before ending a military parade on the 206th anniversary of the signing of the declaration of independence, Maduro condemned the violence and said ""strange facts always occur with the opposition."" He also ordered an investigation.

""I will never be complicit to any act of violence,"" he said. ""I want peace for Venezuela. I do not accept violence from anyone.""

Lawmakers pledge vote will go ahead

Despite the violence, lawmakers vowed to proceed with a scheduled session to discuss an unofficial plebiscite -- a national vote that would be a move toward an election seeking to oust Maduro.

National Assembly vice president and opposition leader Freddy Guevara told state-run TV station Capitolio that the session would go ahead as planned on Wednesday.

Opposition deputy Armando Armas is assisted after being injured by supporters of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

The July 16 plebiscite will pose questions on the level of confidence in Maduro and seek public input on his rewriting of Venezuela's constitution.

Guevara, told CNN en EspaÃÂ±ol that lawmakers Armando Armas and AmÃÂ©rico de Grazia were injured in the confrontation with Maduro loyalists. Lawmakers Nora Brancho, Luis Carlos Padilla and Leonardo Regnault were also injured, according to a Twitter post from the assembly.

Assembly member Armando Armas, his head and white shirt bloodied, posted a video on Twitter with the message: ""We were elected to defend the country. Today, July 5, barbarity wants to impose itself before civility. Down with the dictatorship!""

""We will defend Venezuela at all costs, even with our lives,"" he said.

Assault follows continuing unrest

In April, amid widespread criticism, the Supreme Court revoked a ruling transferring all National Assembly powers to the court, which is stacked with government loyalists. The opposition had called the move a coup.

The latest assault on the National Assembly follows several tumultuous days for the troubled nation.

JUST WATCHED Maduro: Helicopter attacked Supreme Court Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Maduro: Helicopter attacked Supreme Court 01:26

No one at the Supreme Court was injured and military forces did nothing to intervene -- even though Perez was flying in plain sight. Government critics said it was a stunt orchestrated by Maduro to justify using a heavier hand on protesters. Maduro condemned the attack and denied any involvement.

On Wednesday, Perez appeared in a video saying the goal of his mission was achieved, which was to damage the Justice Ministry and Supreme court without causing collateral damage.

""We are not assassins, like you, Mr. Nicolas Maduro,"" he said.

""Once again we are in Caracas, ready and willing to continue our struggle for the liberation of our country,"" Perez said in the video, wearing a military uniform, with a Venezuelan flag and a rifle as a backdrop.

Maduro last week also clashed with his attorney general, Luisa Ortega, who broke government ranks this spring and has lambasted Maduro for alleged human rights abuses. The Maduro-backed Supreme Court froze Ortega's assets and ordered her not to leave the country as she may face a trial.

""I have committed no crime nor errors and I am not going to submit to this unconstitutional and illegitimate court,"" Ortega said at a news conference Tuesday, explaining why she did not attend a Supreme Court hearing.

More than 85 have died in street violence

Opposition lawmakers were physically pushed around last week at the National Assembly by the national guard, which is controlled by Maduro.

Near daily clashes between government forces and protesters have paralyzed the country for months. More than 85 people have died since the beginning of this latest round of civil unrest, according to the attorney general's office.

With unemployment set to surpass 25% this year and severe food shortages, some Venezuelans have opted to leave the country.

They are crossing the border into Colombia after enduring months without basics such as milk, eggs, flour, soap and toilet paper.

Venezuelans are also struggling with a shortage of medicine, and some are also taking their sick to Colombian hospitals.

And this is my wallets savings.Hidden identities are a popular feature of the twilight world of virtual money. Now that the total value of cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin and ether, soared June 6 to more than $100 billion, approaching the market value of McDonalds Corp., concerned regulators say it might be time to link wallet IDs with actual humans.  Secrecy persists from the days, earlier this decade, when Ross Ulbricht, going by the nom de guerre Dread Pirate Roberts, used bitcoin to launder money and traffic in narcotics, activities for which he started serving a life term at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York.Thats not to say that 0x00A651D43B6e209F5Ada45A35F92EFC0De3A5184 or any other entities are doing anything illegal. But opacity may be worsening jagged price movements. The value of ether, for example, rose from about $8 a unit at the start of the year to crest at $400 in June before settling around $250 today. A lack of transparency could also be stifling the mainstreaming of online money, according to draft legislation issued by the European Parliament in March.The credibility of virtual currencies will not rise if they are used for criminal purposes, the draft said. In this context, anonymity will become more a hindrance than an asset for virtual currencies and their potential future popularity.Pseudonymity has always been a big part of the markets allure.

That allows for the use of smart contracts, or pieces of computer code that make the terms of such agreements operate automatically. The blockchain has the potential to reshape business and finance by enabling immediate settlements of activities such as bank transfers and securities trades.JPMorgan Chase & Co., BP Plc, Microsoft Corp. and ING Groep NV are among those experimenting with it.The current value of all the ether held, $23 billion, means dozens of electronic wallets have accrued nine-figure positions.

He said last month that he has 10 percent of his net worth invested in virtual money. Thats a stake worth at least $90 million, given a net worth calculated at $925 million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Novogratz declined to comment.Cryptocurrencies could become a $5 trillion industry, but they need to develop sound business principles to satisfy regulators and lend legitimacy, Novogratz said June 27 at a fintech conference in New York.Lubin, the former chief operating officer for Ethereum Switzerland GmbH, which developed the software, could hold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ether, several investors said. The Canadian entrepreneur didnt respond to requests for comment on his holdings.The long-range vision is moving the fundamental transactional elements of our society from analog, friction-filled systems to natively digital frictionless systems, Lubin told Bloomberg Radio June 21.Buterin said in a Reddit post last month his ether holdings equal what would amount to about $117 million today, according to calculations by Bloomberg.Like bitcoin, ether is struggling to overcome a reputation sullied by cyberattacks and technology bottlenecks. A flash crash last month saw the price of the cryptocurrency tumble to just 10 cents before rebounding to about $300.A lot of lessons will be learned, said Peter Denious, head of global venture capital at Aberdeen Asset Management in Stamford, Connecticut. A lot of money will be lost before a lot of money can be made.0x00A651D43B6e209F5Ada45A35F92EFC0De3A5184 couldnt be reached for further comment."
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attack-ukraine-germany-idUSKBN19S1EU,"GERMANY SAYS CYBER THREAT GREATER THAN EXPECTED, MORE FIRMS AFFECTED","HAMBURG (Reuters) - Germany's BSI federal cyber agency said on Friday that the threat posed to German firms by recent cyber attacks launched via a Ukrainian auditing software was greater than expected, and some German firms had seen production halted for over a week. Analyses by computer experts showed that waves of attacks had been launched via software updates of the M.E.Doc accounting software since April, the BSI said in a statement. That meant that companies that used the software might have been infected by the malicious software, even if there were no obvious signs of a breach, BSI said. Data backups carried out after April 13 should also be viewed as compromised. ""Some German firms have seen production and other critical processes laid still for over a week,"" BSI President Arne Schoenbohm said. ""It has resulted in millions of euros of damage, and this in a case where Germany got off lightly."" BSI last week said more than a dozen German companies had been affected by the virus which has been dubbed ""NotPetya"" by some experts, all via a subsidiary in Ukraine. The Ukrainian software firm used to launch the global cyber attack this week said all computers sharing a network with its infected accounting software had been compromised by hackers. The German statement added to the growing conviction among experts that the global attack was more harmful than initially believed. The virus took down thousands of computers in dozens of countries, disrupting shipping and businesses.  German security officials are still investigating the origin of the virus and do not have reliable data to confirm a claim by the Ukrainian government that Russia was behind the attack. Chancellor Angela Merkel is hosting Russian President Vladimir Putin and other world leaders in Hamburg this week, but there has been little public discussion about cyber security. Schoenbohm said the latest attacks were at least harmful as the WannaCry ransomware attacks seen in May. The agency said it had information making clear that significant efforts were required to restore business processes once infected. ""We must continue to increase Germany's resilience in the wake of cyber attacks,"" Schoenbohm said. The agency urged German companies to separate networks that had the M.E. Doc software installed, to increase network surveillance and to look for any signs of compromise. Password changes and software updates for all infected networks were crucial, the agency said, noting that companies should also review administrative settings for networks.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-idUSKBN19U0CT,IRAQI PRIME MINISTER CONGRATULATES ARMED FORCES FOR MOSUL 'VICTORY',"MOSUL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi arrived in Mosul on Sunday and congratulated the armed forces for their ""victory"" over Islamic State after nearly nine months of urban warfare, bringing an end to jihadist rule in the city.  Islamic State's defeat in Mosul three years after taking the city is a major blow for the hardline Sunni Islamist group, which is also losing ground in its operational base in the Syrian city of Raqqa from where it has planned global attacks. The group, however, still controls territory in Iraq and is expected to revert to more conventional insurgent tactics such as bombings as its self-proclaimed caliphate falls apart. The battle for Mosul - by far the largest city to fall under the militants' control - has left large areas in ruins, killed thousands of civilians and displaced nearly 1 million people. ""The commander in chief of the armed forces (Prime Minister) Haider al-Abadi arrived in the liberated city of Mosul and congratulated the heroic fighters and Iraqi people for the great victory,"" his office said in a statement. State television later showed Abadi touring Mosul on foot alongside residents of Iraq's second-largest city.  Air strikes and exchanges of gunfire could still be heard in the narrow streets of Mosul's Old City, where the group has staged its last stand against Iraqi forces backed by a U.S.-led international coalition. Abadi met commanders in west Mosul who led the battle, but he has yet to issue a formal declaration that the entire city has been retaken from the group which is also known as ISIS. Abadi's spokesman, Saad al-Hadithi, said victory would not be formally declared until the few remaining Islamic State militants were cleared from Mosul. Still, France and Britain, members of the coalition that has conducted air strikes and provided training and assistance to Iraqi forces on the battlefield, welcomed the defeat. ""Mosul liberated from ISIS: France pays homage to all those, who alongside our troops, contributed to this victory,"" French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted. ""I congratulate Prime Minister Abadi, and the Iraqi forces who have been fighting on the ground with great bravery and care against a brutal opponent,"" British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said in a statement. While celebrating ""the removal of the death cult from Mosul"", Fallon said the military operation was not over. ""This barbaric group remains dug in west of the Euphrates and clearing operations in and around Mosul will be needed because of the threat from improvised explosive devices.""     In Washington, National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton, when asked whether the battle for Mosul was complete, replied: ""Situation not resolved, but we are monitoring."" Iraq still faces uncertainty and long-term stability will be possible only if the government contains ethnic and sectarian tensions which have dogged the country since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003. The fall of Mosul exposes fractures between Arabs and Kurds over disputed territories, and between Sunnis and the Shiite majority.        The group vowed to ""fight to the death"" in Mosul, but Iraqi military spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Rasool told state TV that 30 militants had been killed attempting to flee by swimming across the River Tigris that bisects the city.     Cornered in a shrinking area, the militants resorted to sending women suicide bombers among the thousands of civilians who are emerging from the battlefield wounded, malnourished and fearful, Iraqi army officers said. The struggle has also exacted a heavy toll on Iraq's security forces.  The Iraqi government does not reveal casualty figures, but a funding request from the U.S. Department of Defense said the elite Counter Terrorism Service (CTS), which has spearheaded the fight in Mosul, had suffered 40 percent losses.         The Department of Defense has requested $1.269 billion in U.S. budget funds for 2018 to continue supporting Iraqi forces, which collapsed in the face of the few hundred militants who overran Mosul in 2014. Backed by coalition air strikes, an array of Iraqi forces gradually clawed back territory from Islamic State until reaching Mosul, the group's de facto capital in Iraq, last October.     It is almost exactly three years since the ultra-hardline group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, proclaimed a ""caliphate"" spanning Syria and Iraq from the pulpit of Mosul's medieval Grand al-Nuri mosque.     Abadi declared the end of Islamic State's ""state of falsehood"" a week ago, after security forces retook the mosque - although only after retreating militants blew it up.     The United Nations predicts it will cost more than $1 billion to repair basic infrastructure in Mosul. In some of the worst affected areas, almost no buildings appear to have escaped damage and Mosul's dense construction means the extent of the devastation might be underestimated, U.N. officials said.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-cyber-idUSKBN19U0P4?il=0,TRUMP BACKTRACKS ON CYBER UNIT WITH RUSSIA AFTER HARSH CRITICISM,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday backtracked on his push for a cyber security unit with Russia, tweeting that he did not think it could happen, hours after his proposal was harshly criticized by Republicans who said Moscow could not be trusted. Trump said on Twitter early on Sunday that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed on Friday forming ""an impenetrable Cyber Security unit"" to address issues like the risk of cyber meddling in elections. The idea appeared to be a political non-starter. It was immediately scorned by several of Trump's fellow Republicans, who questioned why the United States would work with Russia after Moscow's alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. ""It's not the dumbest idea I have ever heard but it's pretty close,"" Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" program.  Ash Carter, who was U.S. defense secretary until the end of former Democratic President Barack Obama's administration in January, told CNN flatly: ""This is like the guy who robbed your house proposing a working group on burglary."" Trump's advisers, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, had recently sought to explain Trump's cyber push. Mnuchin said on Saturday that Trump and Putin had agreed to create ""a cyber unit to make sure that there was absolutely no interference whatsoever, that they would work on cyber security together."" But Trump returned to Twitter on Sunday to play down the idea, which arose at his talks with Putin at a summit of the Group of 20 nations in Hamburg, Germany.  ""The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit doesn't mean I think it can happen. It can't,""  Trump said on Twitter.  He then noted that an agreement with Russia for a ceasefire in Syria ""can & did"" happen. Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona acknowledged Trump's desire to move forward with Russia, but added: ""There has to be a price to pay."" ""There has been no penalty,"" McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" program according to a CBS transcript. ""Vladimir Putin ... got away with literally trying to change the outcome ... of our election."" Trump argued for a rapprochement with Moscow in his campaign but has been unable to deliver because his administration has been dogged by investigations into the allegations of Russian interference in the election and ties with his campaign. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the matter, including whether there may have been any collusion on the part of Trump campaign officials, as are congressional committees including both the House of Representatives and Senate intelligence panels. Those probes are focused almost exclusively on Moscows actions, lawmakers and intelligence officials say, and no evidence has surfaced publicly implicating other countries despite Trump's suggestion that others could have been involved. Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump says his campaign did not collude with Russia. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" program that Russia could not be a credible partner in a cyber security unit. ""If thats our best election defense, we might as well just mail our ballot boxes to Moscow,"" Schiff added. Separately, U.S. government officials said a recent hack into business systems of U.S. nuclear power and other energy companies was carried out by Russian government hackers, the Washington Post reported on Saturday. Trump said he ""strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election. He vehemently denied it."" He added: ""We negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives. Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!"" In Trump's first attempt at ending the six-year Syrian civil war, the United States, Russia and Jordan on Friday reached a ceasefire and ""de-escalation agreement"" for southwestern Syria. The ceasefire was holding hours after it took effect on Sunday, a monitor and two rebel officials said.     Any joint U.S.-Russia cyber initiative would have been a different matter. Depending how much it veered into military or espionage operations, it could have faced major legal hurdles. Language in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act prohibits the Pentagon, which includes the National Security Agency and the U.S. military's Cyber Command, from using any funds for bilateral military cooperation with Russia. Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, also noted restrictions on sharing information with Russia that would clearly prohibit offering Moscow a sense of U.S. cyber capabilities. Russia would be similarly adverse to revealing its capabilities to the United States, he noted. ""It just will not happen,"" McFaul told Reuters.

In a court filing late on Friday, Hawaii's attorney general asked a Honolulu judge to issue an injunction allowing grandparents and other family members to travel to the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court last month let the ban on travel from six Muslim-majority countries go forward with a limited scope, saying it could not apply to anyone with a credible ""bona fide relationship"" with a U.S. person or entity. The Trump administration then decided that spouses, parents, children, fiancés and siblings would be exempt from the ban, while grandparents and other family members traveling from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen would be barred.  Trump said the measure was necessary to prevent attacks. However, opponents including states and refugee advocacy groups sued to stop it, disputing its security rationale and saying it discriminated against Muslims. Earlier this week Hawaii had asked a Honolulu judge for a court order clarifying the Supreme Court's ruling to allow grandparents into the United States. The judge, along with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, ruled that the lower courts did not have the power to simply clarify the Supreme Court's opinion. However, the 9th Circuit on Friday said the courts could issue an injunction against Trump's policy in the future, if the government misapplied the Supreme Court's ruling to a particular person or entity harmed by the travel ban. Hours after that ruling, Hawaii made such an injunction request in a Honolulu federal court. Hawaii said the state itself, along with resettlement agencies, are harmed by Trump's guidelines because they are prevented from helping refugees move there. A Justice Department spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment.  The roll-out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued last week than in January when Trump first signed a more expansive version of the order. That sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world. Reporting by Dan Levine in San Francisco; Editing by Mary Milliken"

The bull that led the pack thrust its horn into Hillmann's buttocks before flipping him onto the street.""In a split second he was on me. I tried to jump, but he hit me in the butt,"" the Chicago resident told The Associated Press by telephone from a hospital in Pamplona.""I flew up in the air and landed on my back. I didn't know I was gored at first,"" he said. ""Then people started telling me I was gored and pulled me over to the medics. I pulled down my pants and there was blood.""Despite his run-in, Hillmann says his love for the chaotic and treacherous spectacle of Pamplona's rampaging bulls hasn't wavered.""I am probably going to run tomorrow or the next day, sure at this festival,"" he said. ""I am already walking. The first time, I wasn't walking for a week.""Hillmann's wound was less severe than those of a 22-year-old American who also was gored on Saturday. Identified by the regional government of Navarra only with the initials J.C., he was in serious condition after his left arm was impaled and he was dragged for several meters (yards) before the bull flung him off and stormed over him. WBBM Chicago identified him as Jack Capra, of California, who told the station it had been his first running with bulls.Three other Americans, two Frenchmen and three Spaniards  all men  needed hospital treatment for injures received during Saturday's frantic and crowded run of thrill-seekers. Two Americans and a Spaniard also were gored on Friday.Hillmann was in Pamplona for a 12th consecutive year to brave the bulls and ran on Friday.He was gored in the early stages of the run, when the bulls from the ranch of Jose Escolar confirmed their reputation as being unpredictable.The bulls completed the 930-yard (850-meter) cobbled-street course in just over four minutes  well over the average of three minutes  because one bull broke away from the rest and turned around.The other five plowed into the slower-moving crowds, knocking many runners down as they maneuvered through the narrow streets and wooden barricades.Hillmann described this second goring as ""just a tick"" compared to his first one in 2014, which produced two thigh wounds he called ""traumatic.""Hillmann, like scores of foreigners, discovered the San Fermin festival thanks to Nobel Literature laureate Ernest Hemingway's 1926 novel ""The Sun Also Rises.""""It changed my life. It made me want to be a writer, to run the bulls, to come to Spain,"" he said. ""When I got here everything in the book was still here, but a thousand times more. And it just keeps getting more interesting. People think this is just crazy people running. There is real art. If you pay attention, you can see it.""Hillmann claims to have participated in over 300 bull runs across Spain at traditional summer festivals. He has written a guide on bull running, along with a novel, and was back in Pamplona to make a documentary featuring him as a bull runner.""The thing is that when you run, you always have doubts because you are taking a decision that can end your life,"" he said. ""There is a shadow that follows you. Sometimes I don't run because I don't feel right. I usually get premonitions. Not today. I felt good today, but it didn't go my way."""

Trump's then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, also attended the meeting at Trump Tower on June 9, 2016, two weeks after Trump won the Republican nomination, the Times reported.   In a statement quoted by the Times and later made available to Reuters and other media outlets, Donald Trump Jr.  acknowledged meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.       ""After pleasantries were exchanged, the woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton,"" the statement said. Clinton was the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee.  ""Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information."" Trump Jr. said Veselnitskaya then turned the conversation to the adoption of Russian children and a U.S. law blackisting Russians linked to alleged human-rights abuses. President Trump was ""not aware of and did not attend"" the meeting, Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Trump's legal team, said in an emailed statement. Trump Jr. said he was asked to attend the meeting ""with an individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign"" at the request of an acquaintance he knew from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant.  ""I asked Jared and Paul to attend, but told them nothing of the substance,"" he said.  ""The meeting lasted approximately 20 to 30 minutes,"" he said. ""As it ended, my acquaintance apologized for taking up our time. That was the end of it and there was no further contact or follow-up of any kind. My father knew nothing of the meeting or these events.""  The New York Times report said Trump Jr. was promised damaging information about Clinton before agreeing to meet with the lawyer. It cited three advisers to the White House briefed on the meeting and two others with knowledge of it. The Times first reported on the meeting on Saturday, after which Trump Jr. issued a statement confirming that it took place, but made no mention of the Clinton aspect. Representatives for Manafort and Kushner did not respond to requests for comment. Allegations of the Trump campaign's ties to Russia have cast a shadow over Donald Trump's first five months in office. A federal special counsel and several congressional committees are investigating possible contacts between the campaign and Russian representatives as part of a larger probe into allegations that Moscow meddled in the election. The June meeting was the first confirmed private meeting between members of the president's inner circle and a Russian national, the Times reported, citing confidential government records and interviews with people familiar with the documents. The revelations come after President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the allegations of election meddling during the summit of leaders from the Group of 20 major economies in Hamburg, Germany. The Kremlin has denied U.S. intelligence agencies' conclusion that Moscow tried to tilt the election in Trump's favor, using such means as hacking into the emails of senior Democrats.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/10/politics/kellyanne-conway-anchor-clash-cnntv/index.html,"CNN'S CUOMO, CONWAY CLASH OVER DONALD TRUMP JR.'S MEETING WITH RUSSIAN LAWYER","(CNN) White House counselor Kellyanne Conway defended Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer in a wide-ranging, 35-minute interview Monday with CNN's Chris Cuomo, saying there was ""no information provided that was meaningful.""

""Let's focus on what did not happen in that meeting,"" she said, speaking on ""New Day,"" adding there was ""no action taken. Nothing.""

Conway said the President's son had taken the meeting based on connections made through the Miss Universe pageant and promises of a conversation about adoption policy. She said he did not even know the name of the lawyer going into the meeting.

""Don Jr. has very explicitly stated he didn't even know the name of the person with whom he was meeting,"" she said. ""He agreed to the meeting based on a contact from the Miss Universe Pageant.""

""They get into the meeting and it quickly turns into a pretext for Russian adoption, according to his statements, that the comments this woman is making about any type of information on Hillary Clinton were vague. They were meaningless.""

Trump Jr. changed his account of events as he was presented with new reporting by The New York Times. When the paper first reported on the meeting -- but not about the promise of information about Democrats -- he said it was a ""short, introductory meeting"" about adoption.

""I asked (Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner) and (then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort) to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at that time and there was no follow up,"" Trump Jr. initially said in a statement.

But on Sunday, when the Times -- citing three advisers to the White House briefed on the meeting and two others with knowledge of it -- reported about the lawyer offering to provide information about the Democratic National Committee before he took the meeting, he acknowledged that Democrats and Hillary Clinton were discussed. He said the lawyer had ""no meaningful information"" to offer him, adding that he was not told her name prior to the meeting.

""After pleasantries were exchanged, the woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton,"" Trump Jr. said in the statement. ""Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.""

He added, ""She then changed subjects and began discussing the adoption of Russian children and mentioned the Magnitsky Act. It became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along and that the claims of potentially helpful information were a pretext for the meeting.""

He defended himself, sarcastically, on Twitter Monday: ""Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent... went nowhere but had to listen.""

Trump Jr. on Twitter said there were no inconsistencies in his statements.

""I simply provided more details,"" he tweeted Monday.

Cuomo, however, seized on the changes in Trump Jr.'s story.

""He changed his story twice. You talked about being in a court of law -- not good when you change your story,"" Cuomo said. ""There are big implications when you change your story like this. Second of all, even if it is true, whether or not it was good information, Kellyanne, doesn't mean it was a smart move to take a meeting with a Russian-connected person who was going to give you negative information about your opponent. That could create huge legal issues. You know that.""

""I admire your moxie, sitting there with the CNN chyron next to you,"" she replied.

""I could not be more proud to have that CNN chyron next to me,"" Cuomo fired back.

Throughout the often-tense interview, Conway leveled a sustained attack on the media and CNN in particular, suggesting it was obsessed with the probes into potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.

""Aren't you the least bit reluctant, if not embarrassed, that you now talk about Russia more than you talk about America?"" Conway asked.

Cuomo, however, argued that the President's Twitter feed, which often features attacks on the media and commentary on the Russia investigations, was evidence that the issue mattered to him as well.

""The President spends as much time tweeting about this as anything else,"" said Cuomo. ""I'll show you his thread right now. It's not filled with ideas for new jobs. He's on this stuff as well.""

""I'm sorry, he's the President of the United States and you are looking at his ... social media instead of listening to what he does,"" replied Conway, who followed up with: ""Name three things he talked about at the Department of Transportation.""

Despite her sharp words, however, Conway said twice she had not come on air to attack CNN.

""We appreciate the platform, Chris. But, look ... I'm not here to bash CNN,"" she said, adding, ""We need to find a way to work together better."""
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-air-france-traffic-idUSKBN19U09X?il=0,AIR FRANCE-KLM URGES FRENCH AUTHORITIES TO EASE AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKS,"AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (Reuters) - The chief executive officer of Franco-Dutch airline group Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA) urged French authorities on Saturday to take ""urgent"" measures to reduce delays for passengers caused by security checks at Paris airports. The delays caused by police checks, in a country that was hit by deadly Islamist militant attacks in the last two years, come at a time when passenger traffic is picking up ahead of the crucial summer holiday season, according to Jean-Marc Janaillac. Janaillac told Reuters in an interview he had written to the French interior minister urging him to take quick measures. The queues at the police filters at Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport, the country's largest in the north of the capital and Orly, in the south, can take more than two ours, Janaillac said. ""Waiting times at police checks are very, very long, sometimes more than an hour and a half at Roissy and can go over two hours at Orly, which totally disrupts the transport chain and contributes to flight delays,"" he added. Janaillac called on French authorities to allow a greater use of facial recognition technologies that exist in London or Amsterdam, hire more air and border police and to ease on passport checks to some destinations. The French interior ministry did not immediately respond to a request for a comment. Tourism, a large source of income for the country, has gradually rebounded after the attacks in Paris and the Riviera city of Nice caused a sharp slump last year. ""Traffic, as is the case for all companies, is indeed dynamic right now,"" Janaillac said on the sidelines of an economic forum in Aix-en-Provence. ""There is a positive trend in the second quarter,"" he added. The airline group will publish its traffic figures on Monday.

http://cnn.com/2017/07/10/us/california-wildfires/index.html,"CANADIAN WILDFIRES FORCE 14,000 TO EVACUATE AS CALIFORNIA FIRES RAGE","(CNN) More than 200 wildfires were burning in British Columbia, Canada, Monday evening, forcing 14,000 people to evacuate, according to fire officials.

About a dozen of the fires are considered major, Kevin Skrepnek, spokesman for the British Columbia Wildlife Service, said Monday. Military assistance has been brought in to help the 1,000 fire personnel currently fighting the fires, which are mostly in rural areas.

Canada's Minister of Public Safety Ralph Goodale said in a news conference Monday that an additional 300 personnel were on their way to assist. British Columbia also enlisted the help of the Canadian Armed Forces' aircraft to transport first responders and assist in evacuations, Goodale said.

Friday and Saturday each saw around 100 new fires, Skrepnek said, with 29 starting on Sunday.

Here's what the devastation looks like at the Boston Flats. Roughly 30 homes were razed to the ground. https://t.co/9DL8qdlEqy #bcwildfire pic.twitter.com/PGHHMfdfty

The fires have left thousands without power, according to BC Hydro and Power Authority , one of the province's electricity distributors, which said it had 100 crews working to repair electrical infrastructure.

But officials believe there's a long way to go before the fires are brought under control.

""Generally, we're looking at a deteriorating situation,"" said Bob Turner, British Columbia's Assistant Deputy Minister of Emergency Management, in an update on Monday

""We are looking at many weeks to come of a very challenging environment and public safety will remain the overriding priority for the government and for the BC Wildlife Service.""

Red flag warnings issued in six US states

Sixty children were temporarily trapped by a wildfire on Sunday when an access road at a California summer camp was ""completely enveloped by flames,"" a fire service spokesman said.

The intense fire and fallen trees made the road out of the Circle V Ranch camp in Santa Barbara County impassable for several hours. The campers left so quickly that they didn't have time to retrieve any of their belongings.

At nearby Lake Cachuma, visitors were forced to abandon tents, RVs and boats.

Western wildfires at a glance More than 45,000 acres have been burned across California's Butte, San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties More than 40 high-temperature records were set or tied Saturday across the West, including in Los Angeles At least 45 fires in total are burning across the Western part of the US, according to the US Forest Service About 10,000 people are under mandatory evacuation orders in British Columbia, Canada, according to the BC Wildfire Service

Red flag warnings have been issued by the National Weather Service across six Western states.

A red flag warning means that critical fire weather conditions are happening now or are imminent. The warnings follow a heatwave that saw 40 or more high-temperature records set or tied Saturday across the West, including in Los Angeles; Las Vegas, Nevada; Helena, Montana; and Boise, Idaho.

There are currently 67 large fires blazing throughout the US, 60 of which are uncontained, CNN Meteorologist Haley Brink said. The majority of active fires are in Nevada, Arizona, California and Colorado.

The scorching weather comes after California's prolonged drought emergency was declared officially over in April. Extremely low humidity and winds are helping to fuel the wildfires, not just in California but also Arizona.

Firefighters work in an eerie, smoky orange glow as flames approach an Oroville, California, home on Friday, July 8.

While temperatures in California, Arizona and Nevada are beginning to cool, Brink said, it will still be hot. Temperatures will be between 90 to 100 degrees.

California evacuations

In the hot, dry conditions over the weekend, thousands of Californians evacuated homes at risk from wildfires.

One of the most dangerous is the Whittier Fire in Santa Barbara County in coastal Southern California -- which threatened the children at the summer camp.

One of the campers, Amayah Madere, told CNN affiliate KCBS she was swimming in the pool when a counselor told her to get out of the water and change clothes in a hurry. Campers were escorted to a dining hall to wait while firefighters battled flames around them, she said.

Firefighters are briefed before heading out tonight to battle the Whittier Fire. We wish them a safe and successful night. pic.twitter.com/0EQWAheYDH Ã¢ÂÂ SB Sheriff's Office (@sbsheriff) July 10, 2017

""I prayed that if I didn't die I would go to church and right when I prayed the firefighters came,"" Madere said.

KCBS reported that the children were evacuated by SUVs, with a police escort, and while they were driving away, trees were burning just outside the windows of their vehicles.

Eric Peterson, Santa Barbara County fire chief, said dangerous conditions meant the campers could not be taken out right away. ""They were trapped because the road was completely enveloped by flames and there were trees falling down across the road and there was really just no way to get them out of there,"" Peterson said.

""So we had fire personnel, sheriff's personnel and Los Padres National Forest personnel all back there keeping those kids safe, and they rode it out there with them for hours, until it was safe enough to get them out of there.""

All campers and staff were safe, organizers said in a message posted on social media

Winds out of the southeast are pushing the fire away from Santa Barbara and towards Santa Ynez, authorities said. A path toward Santa Ynez has already burned, which is helping firefighters contain parts of the fire.

The fire began Saturday and expanded quickly, county spokeswoman Gina DePinto said. Its cause was unknown. On Monday it had spread to 10,800 acres with only 5% of the blaze contained, according to Cal Fire.

Fires burn across state

By Monday, 4,000 people across the state had been evacuated, according to Cal Fire spokeswoman Kathleen Schori. Schori said 1,700 people had been repopulated and that plans were in place to get more people back into their homes pending sign off from fire officials.

On Sunday, Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in Butte County, where the blaze known as Wall Fire started Friday. By Monday evening, it had burned 5,600 acres and was 35% contained, Cal Fire said . A fire in Fresno County was burning 8,000 acres with only 5 % of the fire contained.

And more than 2,000 personnel were fighting the Alamo Fire in San Luis Obispo County, which had spread to more than 28,000 acres and was 20 % contained, a Cal Fire spokesperson tweeted Monday evening.

http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/ayutthaya-thailand-trip/index.html,"TRIP TO AYUTTHAYA, THAILAND, RECALLS GLORY DAYS OF OLD SIAM - CNN.COM","Karla Cripps, CNN Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Updated 27th June 2017

(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Filled with crumbling, camera-friendly ruins, Thailand's old capital of Ayutthaya has long been a popular Bangkok day-trip destination.

Just an hour outside of the city, this UNESCO-listed heritage site, founded in 1350, was the second Siamese capital after Sukhothai. Bustling with commerce, it was one of the world's most cosmopolitan cities, welcoming diplomats from far-flung nations.

But in 1767, 250 years ago, the Burmese moved in and demolished the kingdom, forcing inhabitants to move downriver and establish a new capital -- Bangkok

Nowadays Ayutthaya has much more to offer than a fascinating slice of Siamese history.

A recent influx of modern dining and sleeping options is tempting some to stay for the night, making it a great time to turn a visit to one of Thailand's most culturally rewarding cities into a weekend getaway.

Ruins, rivers and great seafood make this ancient capital the perfect Bangkok escape

Ayutthaya's historic highlights

Though the ruins of the former capital are spread throughout modern-day Ayutthaya province, for the sake of time most visitors tend to stick to the main island, which sits at the confluence of three rivers: Chao Phraya (which flows to Bangkok and onto the sea), Lopburi and Pa Sak.

The total area considered World Heritage property is less than three square kilometers.

""The ancient city area is not that large and one of my favorite things to do there is to rent a bicycle and explore the city that way,"" says archaeologist Noel Hidalgo Tan of the Southeast Asian Regional Centre for Archeology and Fine Art.

In terms of specific historic sites, he recommends Wat Phra Sri Sanphet (the former palace grounds) and Wat Mahathat, home to one of Thailand's most photographed relics -- a lone Buddha head emerging from the roots of a tree.

""The strangler figs are reminiscent of the trees growing on the temple ruins in Angkor,"" he says of the head.

""One can get quite close to the Buddha head but remember to be respectful, as people still worship it.""

Remains of Buddha statues can be found throughout Ayutthaya.

Next to Wat Mahathat is Wat Ratchaburana, which Tan says was recently restored by a team of Thai and German stone conservators.

""Wat Ratchaburana has heavy Khmer influences, it looks like one of the towers at Angkor Wat.""

Nearby, the majestic Wat Phra Ram was constructed on the cremation site of King Ramathibodi I, Ayutthaya's first monarch.

Wat Lokayasutharam is where you'll find another well-photographed spot -- a 42-meter-long reclining Buddha.

For those looking for more info on the city's historic sites, Ayutthaya-history.com is a great resource.

Off the main Ayutthaya island on the south bank of the Chao Phraya, the beautiful St. Joseph's Church was built in 1666.

To get a sense of the city's cosmopolitan past, Tan recommends visiting the former Portuguese, Japanese and Dutch settlements to the south of the island.

""They represent some of the early multinational presences in the region who were allowed to build settlements,"" he says.

""Some of the region's earliest churches were established here, in the Portuguese Settlement. The Portuguese legacy continued when the capital moved to Bangkok and if you sail up the Chao Phraya you still see several churches along the banks.

""The Baan Hollanda museum is another great place -- it was the former VOC (Dutch East Indies Company) building.""

Going beyond the city's role as a center of commerce, Tan says it's also compelling to consider Ayutthaya's role in the region's ongoing battles for geopolitical supremacy.

""I think many tourists might come to Ayutthaya seeing it as a former ancient 'capital' of Siam -- not just Thailand -- before the capital moved to Bangkok,"" says the archaeologist.

""But it would be interesting to understand Ayutthaya as a political power that existed contemporary to other kingdoms in medieval Southeast Asia: Angkor (Cambodia), Lan Xang (Laos), Lanna and Sukhothai (northern Thailand) and Pegu and Ava in what is now Myanmar.

""These kingdoms competed, rose and fell in reaction to each other and so in the ruins one sees the echoes of greatness, and at the same time reminders of loss in battle.""

The food

When it comes to food, Ayutthaya is famous for three things: giant river prawns, roti sai mai and boat noodles.

""So popular are Ayutthayan giant river prawns that the animal has been named the aquatic animal symbol of Ayutthaya province -- its mascot, if you want to think of it that way,"" she says.

Giant river prawns are prized for their rich, creamy, oozing tomalley and firm yet tender flesh.

""There are many dishes you can make with them from the classic tom yam or pad thai to the more elaborate dishes,"" says Punyaratabandhu.

""But what most people go for is simple grilled giant river prawns (kung phao) where fresh prawns are cooked over wood charcoal until slightly blackened on the outside and barely opaque on the inside. They're served split in half lengthwise allowing you to see (and scoop out with a spoon) the beautiful tomalley. They're pricy, but they're worth it.""

Prices range from 400-1,400 baht ($11.75-$41) depending on weight.

Roti sai mai, an old-school sweet snack, is Punyaratabandhu's personal favorite.

""Only two components -- no embellishments necessary -- make up this perennial favorite: roti, a wheat-based pastry, and sai mai (literally, 'silk threads'), caramel hand-pulled into ethereal and crystalline strands as thin as your hair,"" she says.

""Not only is roti sai mai delicious; it's fun to eat, too, because the snack always leaves the hands of the vendors unassembled; you're the one putting the two components together seconds before you're about to eat it.""

And lastly, every Ayutthaya visitor is going to want to hit up a local noodle stand for a few bowls of boat noodles.

""Boat noodles, noodles originally sold from boats, are some of the most delicious noodles Central Thailand has to offer,"" says Punyaratabandhu.

""There are multiple types of boat noodles, but the one that stands out among the rest and has come to define the entire genre, is the type redolent of dried spices with its broth dark, hearty, and slightly thickened with blood.

""Ayutthaya has some of the best boat noodles around.""

Hip new offerings

The Wine Ayutthaya.

This year, a piece of modern Ayutthaya architecture has taken a bit of the spotlight away from those historic ruins.

Opened in May, The Wine Ayutthaya -- an extension to the Grand Chaophraya Restaurant (42/1 Moo 4, Ban Run, Ayutthaya; +66 89 615 5999) -- was designed by Bangkok Project Studio and inspired by local wooden homes.

""The building was constructed to become a new tourist attraction in hopes of stimulating the economy of local communities,"" says lead architect Boonserm Premthada of the project.

A single story nine-meter high building blends in with existing large trees.

Made entirely from steel-reinforced plywood, the interior is divided into four platforms, each offering views of the river from different angles.

Another new riverside opening, Ayutthaya's The Summer House (71/1 moo 6 Koh Rean, Ayutthaya; +66 94 224 2223) is adding a modern splash to some old classics.

Located just a short drive from the city center, it's set in the owner's former family holiday home and features bright, modern decor that gives off a Swedish vibe.

Popular dishes include the Summer Roll, a buttery baked bun filled with river prawn and spicy mayo, cheese, lettuce.

Where to stay

Sala Ayutthaya's design was inspired by the area's historical ruins.

Ayutthaya is home to dozens of guesthouses and hotels, many dotting its river banks.

Among the top stays is Sala Ayutthaya , a chic boutique riverside property offering panoramic views of the Chao Phraya river and pretty Wat Phutthaisawan temple.

The design features multiple nods to the city's historic architecture, the most obvious being the liberal use of brickwork, which pairs beautifully with the hotel's stark white walls.

The pool might be small but the property's 26 modern, slick rooms are massive -- and a steal, with rooms starting from just over $100 night.

Many offer views of the river, others have their own small private pool.

There's also a small gallery showcasing photography and paintings from the area as well as a riverside restaurant with an excellent drinks menu that includes a selection of Thai-brewed craft beer.

The slow boat to Ayutthaya

Who needs roads when you've got a 100-year-old restored barge to ferry you to Ayutthaya in style.

Easy as it is to get to Ayutthaya from Bangkok by road, an overnight cruise on a restored rice barge is a far more enjoyable experience.

There's nothing quite like sitting on the open deck, drink in hand, as you watch Bangkok's densely packed riverbanks thin out to make way for open countryside -- dotted with the odd factory.

There are a few options available in Bangkok, with Anantara Dream at the top of the list.

Owned by luxury hotel brand Anantara, this 100-year-old teak barge only has two staterooms and can be booked for private return Ayutthaya journeys.

Tours are customizable but they recommend the two-night/three-day experience, offering plenty of time to explore the area.

Guests depart from the pier at the Anantara Riverside Bangkok Resort.

Bike tours

Though Ayutthaya's colorful tuk tuks are always standing by to shuttle you around, biking is a popular way to explore this compact city.

Bike rentals are widely available but for added insights we suggest booking a tour.

Among the recommended bicycle tour operators is ""The Other Side of Bangkok ,"" which recently started offering Ayutthaya excursions.

You can customize your tour depending on what you want to see/do."

At the same time, the months data could also reflect a new graduating class and the summers seasonal workers joining the labor force -- some likely welcomed by employers who are struggling to find workers.  The data suggest the job market is attracting people off the sidelines, as the size of the labor force and number of unemployed people increased, indicating more people are actively looking for work. The number of people who went from out of the labor force to employed rose to 4.7 million, the highest in data going back to 1990.While wage growth is running below the peak of previous expansions, the figures may be depressed by weak productivity and the retirement of high-earning Baby Boomers, according to economist Stephen Stanley of Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC.Nevertheless, the report marks a relatively strong finish for the labor market in the second quarter that should support continued gains in consumer spending in the coming months. Federal Reserve policy makers raised interest rates last month and reiterated plans to start reducing their balance sheet and increase borrowing costs once more this year.Were seeing pretty steady, solid hiring, said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York. Were just not seeing much acceleration in wages. The unemployment rate picked up for the right reasons. The participation rate ticked up as job seekers came back into the market. It could reflect increased confidence in the labor market.This doesnt change the big picture materially for the Fed, Feroli said. Its mixed -- We had a little higher unemployment, little softer wages but then very strong payrolls."

The probe is the latest twist in a sweeping investigation of automakers and their emissions after Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), which owns the Audi, VW and Porsche brands, admitted systematic cheating of diesel engine tests in 2015.  In a statement, Stuttgart prosecutor Jan Holzner said there were grounds to suspect potential fraud and false advertising by Porsche employees, while declining to elaborate given the ongoing nature of the probe. Porsche said it was fully cooperating with authorities and had proactively sought contact with prosecutors even before a formal probe was launched.

(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Surely the time of Peak Drone -- when the skies over beauty spots become perilous battle zones for hobby photographers -- cannot be far away. Until then, we love nothing more than marveling at the word as seen from a buzzing aerial bot.

Especially when Dronestagram , a site for sharing some of the planet's best bird's eye images, announces the winners of its Annual International Drone Photography Contest.

Thousands of striking entries were submitted for the contest's fourth outing, with three winners announced in each of the four categories: nature, people, urban and -- new for 2017 -- creative.

""A completely new dimension""

First prize winner in the nature category was Jerome Courtial, who photographed a vibrant image of the harvest in Provence, in the South of France. Courtial describes photographing by drone as like ""experiencing the world in a completely new dimension.""

Colin Stan followed in the footsteps of Dracula to take this aerial image of Transylvania.

His enthusiasm is echoed by second prize winner Colin Stan. ""The drone set me free!"" he says. Stan's entry is an atmospheric photograph of a winding road in Transylvania -- framed by pine trees and sunlight.

""As the legend says, this is the view that Count Dracula himself saw on his nocturnal flight,"" says the photographer.

Urban angles

This neighborhood of Dubai used to be desert -- now it's home to the city's highrises.

If Dronestagram's nature entries have a sense of timelessness to them, the urban entries are firmly grounded in 21st century concrete jungles.

The first prize winner is Bachir Moukazerel's shot of Dubai. The photographer wanted to capture one of the city's busiest spots, a haven for high rise architecture -- which Moukazerel notes was just a desert a decade ago.

""Every flight for me is a new adventure,"" he says of the drone experience.

This spectacular image depicts window cleaners scrubbing Moscow's Mercury Tower.

Moscow-dweller Alexey Goncharov's image of the Russian capital is particularly striking. The photograph depicts window cleaners washing the glass exterior of the city's Mercury Tower.

""I liked the way their work looked from that perspective,"" says Goncharvo. ""They seemed to wash the city itself, not just the building's windows.""

Goncharvo took second prize in the urban category.

Innovative outlooks

Drone photographers can play with perspective to great effect.

The judges introduced a new category this year, celebrating the most innovative drone creations.

Cape Town photographer Luke Bell captured the shadows of two cows, creating an unexpected dynamic.

Meanwhile Romain Gaillard was inspired by his children playing on the beach:

""As I watched my children playing on the beach and drawing in the sand I had the idea of using the sand as a large sheet of paper,"" he says.

A particularly fun image is Macareuxprod AKA Thibault Beguet's entry.

That's one way to break the news...

Beguet's photograph was taken on a beach in Normandy, in celebration of the fact that he and his partner are expecting a baby. The image is a ""fun, original and unusual way to announce it to our loved ones, family and friends,"" says Beguet."

Activists in Nepal are campaigning against the continued use of menstruation huts

New Delhi (CNN) A teenage girl in Nepal has died after she was bitten by a snake while banished to a cowshed during a menstruation ritual that sees young women separated from their families and made to sleep alone.

The victim, 19-year-old Tulasi Shahi, from western Nepal's Dailekh district, was taking part in chhaupadi, a common practice in the west of the country in which women, considered unclean during menstruation, are sequestered for the extent of their periods.

It's a ritual that Shahi had likely endured many times before, but on Thursday night, alone on the floor of her uncle's cowshed, the teenager was bitten by a poisonous snake. ""Twice, on her head and leg,"" the local district mayor Surya Bahadur Shahi told CNN.

Shahi's family members initially attempted to treat her using home remedies, before later taking her to a local health center, which did not stock the anti-venom medicines needed.

The monsoon rains had flooded the region's mountainous roads, making the three-hour journey to the nearest hospital all but impossible.

The new French government wants to end sales of gas and diesel-powered vehicles by 2040 as it fights global warming.

After that date, automakers will only be allowed to sell cars that run on electricity or other cleaner power. Hybrid cars will also be permitted.

Nicolas Hulot, the government official in charge of France's ""ecological transition,"" said the goal would help the nation's automakers ""innovate and become market leaders.""

""A revolution in the mobility of everyday life awaits us,"" he said.

The government outlined a range of initiatives to help reach its goal, including support for the development of alternative fuels such as electricity and hydrogen. It's also planning to finance new infrastructure for charging electric cars.

The government also promised a cash-for-clunkers program to pay people who give up their old, polluting vehicles and trade up to a cleaner vehicle. It did not provide details on how the scrappage program would work.

French President Emmanuel Macron has been clear about his plans to promote policies to protect the environment. In a televised speech in June, he condemned President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement and called on people to ""make our planet great again.""

He offered refuge to American scientists, engineers and citizens who were disappointed by Trump's move.

""They will find in France a second homeland. I call on them, come and work here with us, to work together on concrete solutions for our climate,"" he said.

Related: Why gas-powered cars aren't going away

France's move to phase out vehicles that rely solely on the combustion engine comes one day after automaker Volvo announced that every car it makes from 2019 onward will have an electric motor.

Volvo is the first traditional carmaker to fully embrace electric and hybrid production.

French drivers bought just over two million cars last year. The share of cars powered by electric, hybrid and alternative fuels is small -- about 4% -- but growing fast. Sales of those vehicles were up 25% in the first quarter of 2017.

Several factors are pushing the auto industry towards electric motors, including tougher environmental regulations and the desire for self-driving cars, which will need more electrical juice for all their computing needs.

But eliminating the gas engine altogether will be difficult.

A key reason is profitability. Tesla (TSLA) has yet to report an annual profit. Traditional automakers are making billions of dollars selling millions of gasoline-powered cars each. No one has yet figured out a way to make a profit selling electric-only vehicles.

Thats fairly atypical.While headhunters can get lofty retainers for executive positions, a 16-year low unemployment rate and a record-high number of job openings are turning workers across all sorts of industries -- from construction to trucking to software engineering -- into hot commodities. The need is so dire that employers are handing out large signing bonuses, giving second looks to people with blemishes on their resumes and reaching out to professional recruiters more than ever.The numbers show why thats the case: There were 1.17 unemployed job seekers for every vacancy in April, the second-lowest ratio in data going back to 2000. That compares with a post-recession peak of 6.65 people per job opening in July 2009. Revenue for U.S. search-and-placement services rose to $21.9 billion in 2016, almost triple the level in 2009, according to estimates from the American Staffing Association.Its a candidate-driven market and companies are scrambling, said Jennifer Pearce, vice president at City Staff, a Washington-based firm that places about 400 new hires a year, including people who work in international development and at non-profit organizations. Its now become equally important for a company to keep employees interested and challenged to keep them from getting bored and accepting other offers.The tight job market means employers are hiring at a slower pace, albeit still a solid one. U.S. employers are estimating a payrolls increase of about 177,000 positions in June, after 138,000 in May, based on the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey ahead of Fridays Labor Department report. For the full year, economists project an average monthly increase of 167,000 jobs, down from 187,000 in 2016. The unemployment rate is estimated to have held at 4.3 percent.Wage gains probably accelerated in June, rising 0.3 percent from the previous month, according to the median estimate. That would match the fastest pace in 2017, though year-over-year pay growth forecast at 2.6 percent remains below the 2.9 percent peak of the eight-year expansion.Weve got a tight labor market and job growth will slow this year because businesses are finding it difficult to hire, said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group Inc. in Pittsburgh. At some point businesses are going to be forced to raise pay as they see their workers leaving for somewhere else.Discouraged by meager pay raises, workers are changing jobs and finding its paying off. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta data show job switchers enjoyed 3.9 percent higher pay than a year earlier, according to a three-month average of median wage growth as of May, while people who remained in the same job saw only a 3 percent increase.Glenn Murphy, partner at recruiter Bamboo Talent in New York, says theres so much work to go around that technology companies -- who once would offer the firm retainer fees for only the highest level of talent -- are now offering to pay upfront for a variety of roles, from chief technology officers down to vice presidents, directors and engineering managers. A strong engineering candidate can probably get a dozen messages a day from recruiters and companies on LinkedIn, he said.Those headhunters are finding more and more success. The number of Americans voluntarily leaving their jobs -- for opportunities such as a new job or going back to school -- is close to its high for this expansion. The quits rate, as its known, was at 2.1 percent in April, compared to 1.3 percent at the start of 2010.To some extent, the labor shortage is a function of employers having unrealistic expectations of what they can get, said Steven Berchem, chief operating officer at the American Staffing Association in Alexandria, Virginia. They have to realize you have to open their pocketbooks to get the talent that they really want.That makes the outlook for recruiters sunny -- if they can find people to do the recruiting.The economy is, if not at full employment, very close, said Ryan Sweet, an economist at Moodys Analytics Inc. in West Chester, Pennsylvania, Its going to be harder and harder and its going to take longer and longer to fill positions."

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-abadi-idUSKBN19V225?il=0,IRAQI PM FORMALLY DECLARES VICTORY OVER ISLAMIC STATE IN MOSUL,"MOSUL (Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi formally declared victory over Islamic State in the city of Mosul on Monday, marking the biggest defeat for the group since it declared a caliphate three years ago. ""I announce from here the end and the failure and the collapse of the terrorist state of falsehood and terrorism which the terrorist Daesh announced from Mosul,"" he said in a speech shown on state television, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. The fall of Mosul effectively marks the end of the Iraqi half of the Islamic State caliphate, which also includes territory in Syria. The group still controls territory west and south of the city. A 100,000-strong coalition of Iraqi government units, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Shi'ite militias launched the offensive to recapture the city from the militants in October, with key air and ground support from a U.S.-led coalition. Abadi, wearing a black military uniform and flanked by commanders from the security forces, thanked troops and the coalition. But he warned that more challenges lay ahead. ""We have another mission ahead of us, to create stability, to build and clear Daesh cells and that requires an intelligence and security effort, and the unity which enabled us to fight Daesh,"" he said before raising an Iraqi flag. About 900,000 residents have been displaced by the fighting, and thousands of civilians are believed to have been killed. The whereabouts of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who announced the founding of the caliphate from Mosul three years ago, is not clear.  There have been several unconfirmed claims of his death. U.S. and Iraqi military sources say he may be hiding in the border area between Iraq and Syria.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-south-idUSKBN19V1SQ,"SYRIAN ARMY, MILITIAS ATTACK REBELS IN SOUTHEAST DESERT","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian troops and Iranian-backed militias launched an assault on Bedouin villages in southeast Syria on Monday to consolidate control of a swathe of desert stretching to the Iraqi border, Western-backed rebels said. The rebels said they came under attack at dawn in a sparsely populated desert area that lies east of the pro-government controlled city of Sweida, mainly inhabited by the Druze minority. The air and ground offensive, backed by Russian air power, was waged on eight villages from Tal Asfar to Tlul al Shuhaib that had been seized at the end of March by Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels from Islamic State after the hardline militants had retreated to regroup further north. ""This is the biggest attack by the regime and on the villages of eastern Sweida. They have used all types of weapons from aerial bombing to artillery and an unprecedented ground offensive,"" said Mohammad Adnan, spokesman of Jaish Ahrar al Ashaer, a rebel group composed of tribal fighters operating in the border area with Jordan. ""In the years when Daesh controlled these area, the army never clashed with them,"" Adnan added. Adnan later said the army was able to seize at least seven villages. An army statement said they had recaptured several towns, villages and strategic hilltops in the eastern Sweida countryside. The rugged area east of Sweida is mainly inhabited by Bedouin tribes who have long defied government authority. Many of them make up the main rebel groups based in the area.   The area is not part of the U.S.-Russian brokered ceasefire for southwest Syria that came into effect on Sunday in the first peace-making effort of the war by the U.S. government under President Donald Trump.  In the southwest, where the ceasefire was generally holding, rebels said the army had stopped aerial bombardments but intermittent shelling continued on rebel-held areas in Deraa city and in the Syrian Golan Heights. ""We are monitoring violations by the regime in several areas using mortars and heavy artillery,"" said Major Issam al Rayes, spokesman for the Southern Front coalition of Western-backed rebel groups. The Syrian army backed by Iranian-backed militias have since June stepped up their bombardment of rebel-held areas in the border city of Deraa in a bid to reach the Jordanian border.  It has also been sending reinforcements further toward the southeastern desert to prevent areas left by Islamic State from falling into the hands of the FSA. ""The Iranian Shi'ite militias are continuing to pour reinforcements into the Badia to expand their area of control. We are doing what we can to repel them,"" said Saed Saif, an official from the FSA's Ahmed Abdo Martyrs Brigade. The advances in areas that had been in Islamic State hands  has brought them within reach of the Iraqi frontier for the first time in years. They have also effectively encircled FSA-controlled desert territory stretching to the Jordanian and Iraqi borders and close to the Tanf garrison in Syria where U.S. forces are based.

But it sure needs to.The Culver City, California-based unit of Sony Corp. is in seventh place at the box office, a lowly spot the studio hasnt occupied since 2000. And Spider-Man: Homecoming, Sonys sixth film about the Marvel superhero, represents the companys best chance to create a mega hit and lay the foundation for action films scheduled out to 2019.Its as important as any film they have released in the past 10 years, said Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co. It is the last major franchise they have.After starting 2017 with a $1 billion write-off and the departure of Michael Lynton, who led the Tokyo-based companys U.S. film, TV and music businesses, Sonys entertainment unit needs to start making hit films again. Last years Ghostbusters revival failed and was followed by disappointments including the star-studded Passengers. Rothman, 62, came in more than two years ago after a hacking scandal toppled former studio chief Amy Pascal.Spider-Man: Homecoming marks a chance to get back in the right direction. The picture starring 21-year-old Tom Holland could debut with sales of $122 million in North America this weekend, analysts at BoxOfficePro.com said. Sony is offering a more conservative $80 million.The movie generated $15.4 million from its night of previews, according to the studio, shy of the $15.6 million Iron Man 3 registered, to be the sixth-biggest tally for Marvel from early Thursday showings. Sony shares slid 0.3 percent to close at 4,245 yen in Tokyo on Friday.Rothman, who came to Sony from 20th Century Fox, has reason to be cautious. Many studios well-known series have failed to meet expectations this year and U.S. moviegoers are showing signs of fatigue with superhero sequels. While Spider-Man has been one of the most popular film characters from the comic book world, the most recent movies havent measured up.The first Spider-Man in 2002, starring Tobey Maguire and directed by Sam Raimi, was an unqualified hit, garnering upbeat reviews and global sales of $822 million on a production budget of $139 million, according to Box Office Mojo. By the last picture in 2014 -- the second featuring Andrew Garfield -- reviews had turned mixed, the budget had swelled past $265 million, according to the Hollywood Reporter, and ticket sales totaled $709 million.For this go-round, Sony turned to Walt Disney Co., recruiting the president of its successful Marvel division, Kevin Feige, as a producer. The company agreed to weave Spider-Man into a larger Marvel storyline featuring many superheroes, while Disney won rights to use the character in movies of its own. Disney retained merchandising rights and could benefit from toy sales linked to the movie.And costs have come down: the budget for the new film was $175 million, according to Sony.It was very much run like a Marvel Studios production, Feige told reporters in April.Success would put future Sony superhero films on firmer ground. These include a 2018 release based on the character Venom, featuring Tom Hardy, along with an animated Spider-Man. The studio also plans a feature with female leads based on Black Cat and Silver Sable. As part of the deal with Disney, Feige will produce a Spider-Man sequel due out in 2019. Pascal, a producer on Spider-Man: Homecoming, will be part of that effort, too.The new Spider-Man continues a story introduced in last years Disney movie Captain America: Civil War, which brought in $1.15 billion in worldwide. It will extend through next years Infinity Wars and possibly another Avengers movie.Hollands introduction began a trajectory of excitement that started over a year ago, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior analyst at ComScore Inc.Homecoming finds Spider-Mans alter-ego Peter Parker in high school in Queens, living with Aunt May, played by Marisa Tomei. Joined by Robert Downey Jr. as billionaire Tony Stark/Iron Man, Spider-Man takes on the evil villain Vulture, played by Michael Keaton. Spider-Man: Homecoming generated 93 percent positive reviews, according to aggregator Rottentomatoes.com, the second best in the series.That will be good news to Sony Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai, who has been at the Culver City studio a lot this year after naming Anthony Vinciquerra to replace Lynton as Rothmans boss. Hirai has been publicly emphatic Sony is committed to its entertainment group.While stuck in seventh place, Sony has had a modest success this year with the heist movie Baby Driver and could have a hit with the The Emoji Movie, due July 28. The first of a new series of Stephen King adaptations, featuring Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the Dark Tower, is scheduled for next month. Other remakes are also on the horizon, such as Flatliners and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.And the studio is contending for future rights to the James Bond movie series. Sony generated $3.17 billion in worldwide box-office sales with the previous four spy films, going back to 2006s Casino Royale.With parent Sony Corp.s diverse businesses spanning electronics and video games, as well an entertainment, a single movie wont make or break the company. But they really need a win here, said Paul Sweeney, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst.To compete in the global film market, Sony will have to have a recurring number of tentpole franchises that you can bring out every year, Sweeney said. Two or three bankable franchises that you can go back to every couple years and you try to get lucky with some of the other ones."

Curing it has been simple in the past. Getting the medicine to go down this time may prove harder.Its not that it will be a bad quarter. Barring an unlikely disaster, companies will say profits rose for the fourth straight time, with analysts calling for a 7.4 percent increase over a year earlier. Whether the patient has become resistant to treatment is the real question.Turbulence has been touching everything from stocks to Treasuries. Tech megacaps as measured by the Nasdaq 100 Index alternated between big gains and losses each day in the holiday-shortened week, while the CBOE Volatility Index hit the highest level since May. Swings in the Nasdaq have averaged almost 1 percent a day since June 9, pushing its 30-day volatility relative to the rest of the market to the highest since 2002.In the past, earnings have been a reliable antidote. Their arrival each quarter has lifted stocks 100 percent of the time since 2013, and under-estimating the profit machine has been a sure route to impoverishment since the bull market began in 2009. Among investors, however, the sense now is that failure to deliver would have larger consequences.We need strong earnings for stocks to stay OK, Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television.Volatility has kicked up as central banks from Asia to Europe and the U.S. took a more hawkish stance while seeking to remove nearly a decade of accommodation. After better-than-expected monthly payrolls boosted stocks on Friday, the S&P 500 Index ended the week up 0.1 percent while the Nasdaq 100 added 0.2 percent.With JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. scheduled to announce results next week, the market faces a stretch that for four years has seen consistent equity gains. The S&P 500 has risen in each of the last 18 reporting season, accounting for 90 percent of the advance over the stretch, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Better-than-expected earnings have contributed to the perfect record by offering investors comfort at times of market turbulence. In the past five years, S&P 500 firms beat estimates by an averaged 3.6 percentage points.The bar is arguably higher this time. Analysts have been standing firm with their forecasts even as economic data trailed expectations by the most since 2011. Their estimates for earnings growth fell by 1.4 percentage points during the course of second quarter, the smallest reduction in six years.Even if the rate of company beats matches the historical pace, it would still represent a slowdown from the first quarter, during which earnings jumped 14 percent.Profit growth weakened in all sectors except for phone-service providers and consumer staples, analyst estimates show. Materials producers are expected to report a 2.4 percent rise, down from 21 percent in the first quarter, as a rebound in commodity prices faded. A trading slowdown and an unexpected decline in Treasury yields may have weighed on results for financial firms. Profit at banks and insurers probably decelerated to 7.4 percent from 17 percent in the January-March period.While it may be still be too soon to call a trend, early releases are showing promising signs. Among 22 S&P 500 companies that have reported results, profits exceeded estimates by 8.5 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Sustained a steady level of growth is key to a market whose valuations are approaching the highest since the dot-com era, according to Stephen Wood, chief market strategist for North America at Russell Investments in New York.Its reasonable to think that the softness in the economic cycle could transmit through into earnings, Wood said by phone. In a good but decelerating earnings environment and with the Federal Reserve pulling back on monetary policy, fundamentals are going to be challenged to support these valuations in the U.S. equity market."

Sign up here to receive our newsletter.Merger Monday has arrived in Asia.Asian companies announced about $19 billion of transactions in less than 24 hours, making this the busiest start to a week for the regions dealmaking in nearly a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The day was led by billionaire Sun Hongbin, who sealed Chinas biggest-ever property acquisition on Monday, rounded out by a deal to create the biggest shipping company plying the Pacific Ocean trade routes.This weeks string of transactions offered a glimmer of hope for investment bankers in the region, who have seem volumes drop after the Chinese government warned about risks in overseas investments and clamped down on some types of dealmaking. Asian mergers and acquisitions fell 13 percent in the six months through June to $495.5 billion, the worst first half since 2014, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Its rare to see several transactions get announced over a short span of time, Steven Leung, an executive director at UOB Kay Hian Ltd. in Hong Kong, said by phone. Merger Monday is more common in the U.S. given its sheer amount of deals.It started off Sunday evening, when state-owned Chinese container line Cosco Shipping Holdings Co. offered $6.3 billion for Hong Kong rival Orient Overseas International Ltd. Then early Monday, Dalian Wanda Group Co. announced two deals worth a combined $9.3 billion to sell theme park and hotel assets to Sunac China Holdings Ltd. Chinese homebuilder Future Land Development Holdings Ltd. said before the market opened Monday its preparing to announce a possible privatization bid for the company, which has a market value of $2 billion. Property tycoon Wang Jianlins Wanda Film Holding Co. also revealed details of a potential purchase, saying it planned to issue new stock to acquire its parent companys Wanda Pictures film-production business.The deals fall under sectors that are ripe for industry consolidation, said Sam Lee, head of equities research at China Merchants Securities Co.s Hong Kong unit. Shipping and real estate in China are both facing a tough operating environment, so companies in those sectors may want to gain market share and competitiveness by conducting M&A.The last time Asian dealmaking was this busy was July 18 last year, when companies led by SoftBank Group Corp. started the week by signing more than $30 billion of transactions, the Bloomberg-compiled data show. SoftBank, backed by billionaire Masayoshi Son, announced a Monday deal to buy chip designer ARM Holdings Plc just after the U.K. voted to leave the European Union. The same day, a Chinese investor group said it would buy the web-browser business of Norwegian developer Opera Software ASA.Announcing deals on Mondays allows bankers and lawyers to spend the weekend hammering out final terms of a transaction, without worrying about leaks during trading hours and requirements to keep investors informed. While the practice has taken hold mostly in the U.S. and Europe, its importance could grow in markets like China where companies need to suspend trading while negotiating a major transaction.For all the fanfare this Monday, there were some hiccups. Hours after the Wanda Group conglomerate revealed the asset sale to Sunac in a website statement, the acquirer was still suspended from trading, with only a holding announcement saying details of a substantial acquisition would be released. Some itchy investors started buying up shares of Wanda Hotel Development Co., which more than doubled its market value in Hong Kong before saying it wasnt involved in the transaction. It still ended the day up 47 percent."

http://cnn.com/travel/article/china-hanging-coffins/index.html,HANGING COFFINS: CHINA'S MYSTERIOUS SKY GRAVEYARDS,"Katie Hunt, CNN Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Updated 7th July 2017

(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ A skull pokes out of a coffin made out of roughly hewn planks of wood, its smooth white surface catching the reflection of the winter light flooding into the dark cave.

It's one of about 30 caskets anchored on a limestone rock about 30 meters (almost 100 feet) up the side of a cave in Guizhou province in southwestern China. It could date back hundreds of years. The coffins, inside and out, are littered with fragments of clothes, bones and ceramics.

For three decades, Wong How Man, a Hong Kong-based explorer, has been hellbent on chasing coffins like these in gravity-defying graveyards across China in an attempt to discover more about this unusual burial custom.

Wong, who began his career as a journalist with National Geographic, first came across a group of coffins perched 90 meters (300 feet) up a cliff face in southern Sichuan, to the north of Guizhou, in 1985 during an expedition to track the Yangtze River from mouth to source.

A life-long obsession was born.

""At first, it was simply how the hell did they get there and then I couldn't stop thinking about why,"" he says. ""And there're so many theories.""

""Hanging coffins"" rest in a cave in Guizhou, southwest China.

Coffin-chasing

Hanging coffins, as they're known, are found across a swathe of central China -- mostly in remote valleys to the south of the mighty Yangtze River, which flows from the Himalayan foothills to China's eastern coast.

The coffins rest in a variety of formations, sometimes barely visible from the ground below. They're lined up in the crevices in the cliff face, balanced on wooden cantilevered stakes, placed in rectangular spaces hewn in the rock face or stacked high up in caves like those Wong saw on his latest coffin-chasing expedition to Guizhou.

The oldest are said to be in the eastern province of Fujian, dating back 3,000 years. There's no clear reason why this practice took place.

Ancient literature from the Tang Dynasty suggests that the higher the coffins were placed, the greater the show of filial piety to the deceased. Others say the reasoning was more practical: It prevented animals from poaching the bodies and kept land free to farm.

New sites are still being discovered. In 2015, the People's Daily newspaper reported that a total of 131 hanging coffins were discovered in the central province of Hubei, placed in man made caves in a cliff 50 meters wide and 100 meters high.

""Experts haven't figured out how ancient people managed to transport the coffin, body and funeral objects -- together weighing hundreds of kilograms -- to the cliff caves,"" the report said.

Many questions, few answers

Intent on discovering more about this extraordinary practice, Wong began to amass a library of what little scholarly research had been carried out on the practice. He published his first paper in 1991 in a US archeology journal.

However, it wasn't until 2000, once Wong had founded the non-profit China Exploration and Research Society (CERS), that he was able to get up close and excavate one of these high-rise cemeteries -- at a site named Washi in northern Yunnan not far from the first site Wong laid eyes on.

The site in Washi, Yunnan where Wong's organization conducted an archeological excavation.

He and his team rapelled down the cliff face to assess the coffins, which rested on rotting stakes of wood. They then built bamboo scaffolding to secure the most vulnerable coffins, which also allowed them to examine and document the contents.

What he found raised more questions than it answered. The oldest coffins dated back to the Tang dynasty but many contained bones from multiple bodies. Wong believes the bodies would have been buried first and the bones put in the hanging coffins once the bodies had decomposed.

The coffins, which were dug out of a solid piece of wood, were then packed with sand -- making them enormously heavy. ""They must have known they would eventually fall down,"" says Wong.

Rapelling down a cliff to get a look at the coffins.

Wong's research has tied the burial custom to the Bo people -- a rebellious minority tribe that once inhabited the border between today's southern Sichuan and northwestern Yunnan provinces.

It's thought they disappeared in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), persecuted by military expeditions led by China's Imperial Armies. But Wong believes some remnants of the tribe assimilated into other local minority groups and may have survived secretly until today. His research formed the basis of a 2003 Discovery Channel documentary on the hanging coffins, where they attempted to recreate how the caskets would have been transported up the cliff face.

Some believe they were lowered down from above while others believe they were raised up via scaffolding.

It's not just the mind-blowing effort it must have taken to erect the coffins that makes the cliff and cave burials so fascinating. The custom seems so at odds with underground burial and cremation -- the way most modern societies, including China's, handle death.

But the open-air burials do have something in common with other funerary practices in China's borderlands. Tibetans and Mongolians practice sky burials -- where bodies are chopped up and offered to vultures or other animals.

In more recent years, Wong's obsession has taken him to Sagada, Luzon, in the Philippines, where cliff burials were practiced as recently as 2007.

No protection?

Earlier this year, I inadvertently rekindled Wang's interest in China's hanging coffins when I shared some photos of the caskets in a cave in Guizhou I came across unexpectedly during a trip to the province in 2016.

Never having heard of hanging coffins in this area, Wong set out from his China field office in Kunming in the neighboring province of Yunnan with a small team to find out more. The cave where the coffins are located is only accessible by river, which emerges from the spectacular limestone cave where the coffins are stacked.

""I like when information comes to me like this in a personal way,"" says Wong. ""The Internet, there's so much information available. It takes away the joy and the reward for big effort. I like the footnotes.""

The Guizhou cave with the coffins is only accessible by river, where bamboo rafts are the traditional form of transport.

Li Fei, a researcher at the Guizhou Provincial Institute of Archaeology, says that there were up to 100 cave coffin sites in the province and the burial practice was followed by Yao and Miao minorities in the region. Most of the coffins date back to the Ming or Qing (1644-1912) dynasties, he adds, though some date back to the Tang dynasty.

The Guizhou site Wong and I visited, like others, wasn't well-protected. Reluctant to scramble up the rocky sides of the caves I didn't get close, but Wong said that while some of the 30 or so coffins were intact, most were falling apart -- bones and disintegrating clothing visible.

Wong was told that there used to be more than 300 coffins in an elevated part of the cave but a fire destroyed them.

Banknotes have also been left by more recent visitors to the site, a superstitious offering for the dead, though not all visitors are respectful -- one skull had a cigarette jutting out of its jaw. In a steep gorge down river, local tourist authorities have erected fake hanging coffins -- perhaps an effort to satiate tourist curiosity and preserve the existing site.

In 1999, at one of the most famous hanging coffin sites in Matangba, Sichuan, which Wong had first visited in the 1980s, he discovered that many of the coffins had been looted -- despite being some 90 meters above the ground and being protected as ""national cultural relics."" The swag allegedly included ancient swords and other valuables, says Wong.

""Going back 20, 30 years, yes China had different priorities and limited funding, but today China has such influence and (protecting these sites) would be small change. It's about the integrity of the their culture and cultural identity. ""

An event held by the Chongqing Cultural Heritage Research Institute.

Xu Jin, a researcher at Chongqing Cultural Heritage Research Institute, studies a hanging coffin site at Longhe, near Chongqing, where coffins are grouped by families. He's held educational events to teach people about the coffins.

He says in a karst region where caves and cliffs are plentiful, burying the dead at a height might have seemed a better option than in land that erodes easily and is prone to sinkholes.

Little studied

Archeology in China is a well-funded and well-regarded field but the study of the suspended coffins appears to have been neglected.

Anke Hein, an archeologist at Oxford University, who has studied burial customs in western China, says the phenomenon straddles different time periods, geographical regions and even disciplines -- falling between archeology and anthropology.

""I'm sure if someone really wanted to do this they could,"" says Hein. ""But you would need the cooperation of difference provinces and local governments, which is difficult, and requires a lot of energy.""

Bamboo scaffolding erected to allow a CERS team to excavate the coffins in Yunnan.

Most expertise seems to be regional, confined to provincial bureaus that focus on individual sites rather than the practice as a whole.

The earliest mention of them in Wong's library is an account by a US missionary in the 1930s. The most comprehensive study in Chinese is by a scholar named Chen Mingfang, who was colorfully profiled by the Los Angeles Times in 2001 . Now likely in her seventies, CNN was unable to track her down.

Wong's spent much of his career exploring, documenting and trying to protect traditions like these in China's borderlands but he doesn't think the mystery of exactly how or why people chose to bury their dead in this way will ever be known."

The government is trying stop the horrific conditions of people eating from garbage and children resorting to prostitution from getting to the press, she writes

Chang is an International Security Fellow for New America. Follow her on Twitter @MinaChang. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.

(CNN) The violence that broke out Wednesday during Venezuela's Independence Day felt all too familiar. In fact, only last week I had seen for myself some of the chaos that has enveloped the country when I visited Caracas.

I was there to meet with local partners who have been begging for help in a humanitarian crisis that is still too often being overlooked. And, as I traveled around the city, I saw suffering and violence -- in plain view -- unlike any I had seen in all my years of working in active war and disaster zones.

I saw a young mother say goodbye to her 7-year-old daughter as a ""fixer"" (a paid smuggler) -- one of the few jobs in Venezuela growing in demand -- arranged to take the child into Colombia. The mother's tears blurred the view of her daughter and the man walking through one of five border checkpoints into the neighboring country and to an unclear future. I was waiting with her older daughter, a scared 12-year-old who was crying inconsolably because her sister had just been given away to a stranger.

But the mother faced a dilemma that many in the country are battling against. She cannot feed her family, which has been living off of one meal of corn flour a day, and believes that her youngest will have a higher chance of survival. She hopes someone on the other side will care for her child.

This scenario is one of the millions of equally tragic scenes unfolding right now in Venezuela. People are dying from lack of basic needs or being killed for speaking out against their poor living conditions. There are no operational medical facilities. For many, there is no medicine, there are no doctors, with scarce clean water leaving disease to fill the void.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-10/the-bugatti-chiron-is-coming-to-the-u-s-but-who-is-buying-it,Missing,"Bugatti introduced its $2.99 million Chiron supercar in Geneva last year, but it wont be until next month that Volkswagens crown jewel brings the fastest car in the world to American shores. And while half of the 500 total Chirons to be made are already spoken for, there are some still available. (According to Manuela Höhne, the head of communications for Bugatti, half of that 250 were bought sight-unseen. Think about that: $2.99 million on a car you havent test driven or even laid eyes on in real life.) When those buyers finally came to Portugal to drive it, some said, Oh wow, I want to have this car for my collection, but now Ive driven it, I want another one, explained Höhne. They want the second one to driveone to keep in the collection, and one to drive.This is the difference between people who buy Bugattis and, say, those who acquire that other VW superstar, the half-million-dollar Lamborghini Aventador S. The average Bugatti customer has 42 cars at home, Höhne said. She declined to specify their average age. Theres small chance the Bugatti buyer is as young as a Rollss buyer, who was recently revealed to be 45 years old, a stunningly low average for a luxury car brandhelped no doubt by the relative youth of buyers in China, where Rolls sells well. Bugatti, on the other hand, sells 37 percent of its wares in Europe, followed by 30 percent in the U.S. and 26 percent in the Middle East. As for Asia, buyers in Japan are more enamored with the French companys craftsmanship and power than they are in China. Bugatti does have Chinese buyersbut they purchase the cars for their homes in Europe and the Middle East, Höhne said. Half the current owner list, she added, are new to the brand altogether. Apparently in previous years, many potential consumers of means had found the bulbous Veyronthe Chirons predecessortoo bulky for their liking. Bugatti designed this new car with an appeal for newcomers in mind. There are indeed some notable new diversions in Chiron. I drove a sky-blue and Navy two-tone version of the 1,500-horsepower supercar yesterday in Greenwich, Conn. In addition to the obvious thrill of piloting a car that costs the same as a large home, its immense speedeven at a body weight of more than 6,000 pounds (equal to the stately Rolls-Royce Phantom sedan)occupies an otherworldly stratosphere. It can hit 120 mph in as short a distance as a basic highway on-ramp. Not that I would know.Also new: The Bugatti badge on the front is hewn from solid sliver (The only thing in the car allowed to be heavy, Höhne says) and three-dimensional, where the previous badge was simply a plated logo imprint. Theres increased luggage room in the still-small trunk and novel space for two garment bags inside the cabin. A new rounded-square steering wheel allows the driver to control all essential functions for driving the car, including starting it, without removing his hands. (The round dials through the center console still control tertiary comforts such as the heated seats and the air conditioning.)While the Bugatti-signature, upright, horseshoe-shaped grille flanks the direct front of the car, the two rows of four square headlights on either side of the face are totally new, as is the 40-millimeter-wider stance of the car. The lights come newly integrated with vents that suck in and funnel fresh air over the brakes and engine at the rear. ""Cool air in, hot air out,"" goes every engineers mantra. Concerning that output is the rear end of the automobile, which is so abrupt that it looks sawed off. After all, what better way to release massive amounts of hot air quickly than to lop off the whole back end so its entire span can act as an exit? The new rear air brake deploys automatically and stays erect most of the time, unless youre starting the car cold. Its accented with the new, long, single-beam taillight that Bugatti cognoscenti call the Kiss Goodbye light. Its so-named for the benefit of the masses who will have only the briefest encounter with Chiron: Theyll have one quick moment of recognition, thanks to that tail light, from behind the car before it speeds away. The new analog backlit interior dial behind the steering wheel is another nod to the Bugatti fan base. Instead of making it purely LED-lit, the company chose to keep it analog so that even with all electronics shut off, those peering through the windows can see and admire its impressive craftsmanship. Its like the beauty of a mechanical watchwe did it to keep fans entertained, Höhne said with a smile. With any luck, itll also keep all those early buyers entertained while they wait for their own car.   "

http://cnn.com/2017/07/06/health/charlie-gard-us-laws/index.html,CHARLIE GARD: COULD THIS CASE HAPPEN IN THE US?,"(CNN) A beautiful boy born 11 months ago is dying in London. The world watches as his parents battle to keep their child alive. Courts will not allow the hospital to release the baby, Charlie Gard, into the parents' custody so they can travel to try an experimental treatment.

Across the ocean, many people are appalled or confused, and wondering: Could a similar situation happen in the United States?

""It's an absolutely horrific situation,"" said Claire Fenton-Glynn, a legal scholar at the University of Cambridge.

Yet according to some medical ethicists, similar cases happen all the time.

The case of Charlie Gard

Charlie was born with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, a rare condition involving weakened muscles and organ dysfunction, among other symptoms. Because Charlie's prognosis is so poor, his doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London want to take him off life support. Charlie has no hope of surviving, they say, and he should be allowed to die in dignity.

Charlie's parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates, found a doctor in the United States who is offering an experimental treatment. They want the hospital to release their baby so they can take him to the United States.

The battle has gone to the courts.

""How do you decide what is in the best interest of the child? The only way to do that is to gather as much information as possible,"" Fenton-Glynn said.

A judge talked to Charlie's parents and Charlie's doctors. The American doctor as well as independent experts were consulted. Generally, the courts ""followed the same rules that they have always followed in relation to medical treatment for children,"" Fenton-Glynn said.

""The parents' advocate was saying the parents' choice should be respected unless you can show that their choice would cause the child significant harm,"" she said. That argument -- despite its appeal to many Americans -- fell on deaf ears in the UK, where Charlie's best interests remained the solo concern.

The judges concluded that the experimental treatment would be ""futile,"" Fenton-Glynn said. ""There's no evidence that it would provide benefit to the child.""

Courts, including the UK Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights in France, agreed with the hospital. The European court ruled June 27 that the hospital could discontinue Charlie's life support.

Since then, US President Donald Trump and Pope Francis have offered help to Charlie and his parents. A Vatican-owned pediatric hospital in Rome offered to bring the boy into its care. The London hospital told Vatican officials this week that it's not able to legally transfer the child.

In the United Kingdom, when parents and doctors dispute what is appropriate medical care, ""it is up to the court to decide -- on a purely objective basis -- what is in the best interest of the child,"" Fenton-Glynn said.

'Unlikely' situation for the United States

Although a Charlie Gard case could happen in the United States, ""it seems unlikely,"" said Dr. John D. Lantos, director of Bioethics Center at Children's Mercy Kansas City.

Similar cases in the US, such as Jahi McMath's, tend to be resolved in favor of parental rights, he explained.

Jahi, a 13-year old-girl , entered Children's Hospital Oakland in California in 2013 for a routine tonsillectomy. After that surgery, Jahi suffered cardiac arrest and excessive bleeding. She was placed on life support and soon declared legally brain-dead.

""All the doctors agreed that (Jahi) met the criteria for being brain-dead,"" Lantos said. ""The courts said, 'Yeah, we respect the doctors' opinion, but if the parents want to pay for her treatment and take her to a different place, we'll let 'em.' And they did. And she is still alive.""

The more common situation in the US is ""where the courts are ordering treatment,"" he said.

It happens, for example, because of religious beliefs, when parents don't want their child to get a blood transfusion. Or when parents refuse the standard, proven treatment in order to try an experimental treatment. In such situations, courts may step in and take protective custody and order the treatment, Lantos said.

American courts ""don't usually do the opposite and say that 'parents who want to keep their child alive are making a decision contrary to the child's interests, because the child would be better off dead, so we're going to overrule the parents,' "" he said. ""Even when a child met the criteria for brain death,"" the courts allowed the parents to seek care, he added.

One famous exception is the case of Terri Schiavo, a woman who suffered cardiac arrest resulting in brain damage in 1990. The US Supreme Court upheld her husband's decision to withdraw life support, despite her parents' objections. She died in 2005 at age 41.

Still, a key aspect of the Charlie Gard case is that there is no question of the parents ""being loving, devoted, attentive, caring people,"" Lantos said.

Sometimes, parents are not visiting their child frequently, are on drugs or are simply not showing themselves to be devoted, caring parents, Lantos said, ""but in (the Charlie Gard) case, the judge went out of his way to praise the parents for their commitment and attentiveness.""

What most Americans found unusual ""and perhaps radical about (the Charlie Gard) decision was, the family wasn't asking the hospital to continue treatment or the National Health Service to pay for it. They said, 'We have the money. We have a doctor in the US who's willing to do it. Just let us go,' "" Lantos said. ""And the courts essentially said, 'Nope, we're not even going to let you go.' ""

English law, explained Fenton-Glynn, does not see parents as having the ""right"" to make decisions on behalf of their children. ""The concept is called parental responsibility: That is, the parent has a responsibility to make decisions, to look after the child,"" she said. ""Parenthood doesn't give them rights; parenthood gives them responsibilities.""

Discretion or rights?

Seema Shah, a lawyer and ethicist who is a faculty member at the Treuman Katz Center for Pediatric Bioethics at Seattle Children's Research Institute, explained that US courts consider ""parental discretion,"" not parental responsibility.

American parents have ""discretion to make decisions"" on behalf of their children, Shah said, ""up to the point where their decisions are going to cause harm to their children.""

Many Americans see it as their ""right,"" she said. Legally, though, US courts are following the same best-interest standard as the UK, but the way it works here, at least in practice, is that ""courts are deferring to parents,"" Shah said.

American courts recognize that parents have values and that parents understand their children, even if this does not give parents rights to do whatever they want, Shah explained.

Still, from state to state, ""there's a lot of variability in practice,"" she said. It's not so much a matter of differences in state laws, it's more a matter of ""different parents make different decisions, and courts and hospitals accommodate those more or less in different states,"" she said.

So, although some children in the US are born with inherited diseases, just like Charlie, their lives look very different from his, Shah said. In America, these babies ""receive care from hospitals willing to accommodate parents who want their children to live as long as possible -- with their suffering minimized, of course,"" she said.

""Wrenching"" is how Shah describes Charlie's case. A lot of detail has not been made public, such as ""the pain doctors expect that Charlie's in,"" she said. ""He's likely sedated to the point where he's not feeling a lot of pain. Still, the procedures he's undergoing may be painful and unpleasant.""

Shah also believes the judge ""might be worried about people taking advantage of desperate parents. The judge clearly struggled with this case.""

""When you look at these cases, what's so hard is, we have to ask ourselves, 'Should we let parents spend a lot of money to take a shot in the dark when the alternative is they will lose their child?' And I don't think there's an easy answer to that question,"" Shah said.

She noted that bioethics and legal principles collide when slow-moving courts must decide cases like Charlie's. Meanwhile, ""the child deteriorates,"" she said. Lacking better processes to resolve disagreements, it's ""delay that makes the decision.""

'A one in a zillion chance?'

""Therapeutic misperception"" is at play in the Charlie Gard case, said Dr. Jeffrey P. Brosco, a professor of clinical pediatrics at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. He's seen this in other bioethical cases and believes cases that closely resemble Charlie's happen stateside all the time.

""Therapeutic misperception is the idea that if there's something that could work, then it probably does work, and 'Yes, I want to be involved with it, and I'm willing to take any chance,' "" said Brosco. ""That seems to be happening here. It certainly was portrayed that way by the courts. You ask a parent, 'Do you want to take a one in a zillion chance?' Most families would say 'Yes.' ""

Though Brosco does not know every detail, he believes from all that he has read that Charlie's situation is one in which ""no more good medical options exist. Where the only thing the medical team is doing, at this point, is causing more pain and suffering,"" he worried.

""Whether it's here, England or Europe, judges have to make these decisions sometimes,"" Brosco said. To head off these situations in South Florida, he said, five hospital ethics committees have joined forces to form a single opinion, presenting a united front whenever a difficult decision must be made.

""It's the whole community of providers that agrees there's only one right thing to do,"" Brosco said.

With different laws in different states and communities rising to the challenges they face, Lantos believes ""the US is too diverse to generalize about.""

Still, when it comes to bioethical matters similar to the Charlie Gard case, ""the state that's been most in the public spotlight is Texas.""

'Even in Texas'

In the 1990s, Baylor University bioethicist Rick Brody began to notice ""some very disturbing cases,"" said Amy McGuire, director of the Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the Baylor College of Medicine.

The cases involved dying patients, where nothing medical could be done to improve their condition, McGuire explained. In each of these cases, a family member was requesting ""continued aggressive life-sustaining treatments, things like multiple amputations,"" she said. ""Things that really the health care professionals felt were a violation of their professional integrity and obligation to their patients.""

Brody and other Baylor faculty put together a task force to devise an ethical approach to deal with such ""futile care.""

They developed and published in 1996 a process-oriented approach: When health care providers believe that a patient request is medically inappropriate, a committee makes a decision. If the members decide that a procedure is futile, doctors can withdraw or refuse treatment against family wishes.

The policy evolved into the Texas Advance Directives Act , which won bipartisan support and was signed into law in 1999 by then-Gov. George W. Bush. A similar process-oriented policy was fashioned for guidelines written by the American Medical Association and published in 1999, McGuire said. The guidelines were not widely adopted by individual states, and recently, she said, the law has sparked controversy and a few unsuccessful challenges.

""Physicians don't have an obligation to offer or to provide medical interventions that are not deemed to be medically inappropriate,"" McGuire said, yet ""all the time,"" people request inappropriate services of doctors.

""For example, does a pediatrician have an obligation to give a baby or a child antibiotics when they're fairly certain that the baby or child has a virus and not a bacterial infection, because the parents are saying, 'I want an antibiotic; my kid is sick'?"" McGuire asked. ""If you provide medical services that are not medically indicated, there could be legal ramifications for that as well.""

The Texas Advance Directives Act amounts to a lot of hoops to jump through, Lantos said, but ""even in Texas, if the parents found a hospital that would take a baby like Charlie Gard,"" the child would probably be transferred.

""Our job as clinical ethicists is to try to help resolve those conflicts before it gets to the point of being so adversarial that nobody can make a decision and the courts have to get involved,"" McGuire said. To prevent gridlock, clinical ethicists negotiate and identify goals of care and try to ""come up with some sort of mediated solution that everybody can feel good about.""

These ""incredibly difficult situations"" are ""best dealt with between family members and health care providers,"" McGuire said. ""We don't want to encourage the politicizing of medical decision-making. I think that would be a very bad direction to go.""

The date when Charlie Gard's life support will be switched off appears to be up in the air, as the hospital is allowing his parents to spend more time with their child. Meanwhile, support from some of the most powerful people in the world -- Trump and the Pope -- has buoyed Charlie's parents.

""The support from the Pope and the President has given us hope. They are traditional men who believe in the family,"" Yates said in a statement. ""They believe in our case and understand why we believe it is right to continue fighting so hard to save Charlie."""
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy-idUSKBN19U11N?il=0,"BIG UK FIRMS CURTAIL INVESTMENT PLANS, CONSUMER SLOWDOWN DEEPENS: SURVEYS","LONDON (Reuters) - The chances of Britain's economy picking up steam diminished further on Monday as surveys showed major companies have curtailed their investment plans and that consumers spent less on their credit cards. The reports added to a string of lackluster economic data that has raised questions about the chances of the Bank of England raising interest rates this year. Accountancy firm Deloitte said business optimism at large British companies fell sharply in the second quarter, dampened by the inconclusive outcome of last month's national election. Deloitte's survey of chief financial officers showed 72 percent thought the overall business environment would be worse once Britain leaves the European Union, the largest proportion since Deloitte started asking the question a year ago.  Only 8 percent of respondents saw an improvement after Brexit. ""This underscores the importance of the Brexit negotiations producing a favorable environment for UK businesses, with access to the skills and markets they need for their future success,"" said David Sproul, chief executive of Deloitte North West Europe. The survey's findings have proven a good predictor for the BoE's own investment intentions survey which BoE officials watch closely as part of their monitoring of Britain's economy.  Businesses are pressing May and her government to negotiate a smooth Brexit in two years' time, saying an abrupt departure would deter investment. Deloitte said investment intentions among CFOs deteriorated, probably disappointing some BoE policymakers who have been pushing for the first interest rate hike in a decade. Rate-setter Michael Saunders said last week he was ""reasonably confident"" that an improvement in exports and investment would more or less offset the consumer slowdown. A separate survey from credit card firm Visa showed consumer spending fell in June, capping the weakest quarter in nearly four years and adding to other signs that shoppers are reining in their spending due to rising inflation and weak pay growth. Spending in the April-June period was 0.3 percent lower than in the same three months in 2016.  ""June data provides further evidence that an increase in the cost of living, coupled with slowing wage growth, are beginning to squeeze household disposable income,"" Visa managing director Kevin Jenkins said. Survey compiler IHS Markit this year said the figures may add to calls for the BoE to keep interest rates on hold. The strength of official data on wages, due on Wednesday, is likely to be critical for BoE policymakers as they mull whether to raise interest rates from their record low 0.25 percent.

http://cnn.com/2017/07/07/health/alaska-worm-infection-walrus-meat-study/index.html,"USE CAUTION EATING WALRUS MEAT IN ALASKA, REPORT URGES","(CNN) Anyone looking to enjoy some walrus meat should be sure it's thoroughly cooked, officials say.

Alaska has had two outbreaks of trichellosis over the past year, which is a disease caused by ingesting animals that eat meat, namely walrus, according to a report published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The infection, also known as trichinosis, is caused by eating the raw or undercooked meat of animals that are infected with a worm called Trichinella, according to the CDC

The worm is typically found in pork as well as wild game such as bear and mountain lion. Trichinellosis cannot be spread through human contact.

Many residents of coastal communities in northern and western Alaska consume walrus and other marine mammals as part of subsistence hunting, or hunting for survival. This tradition is critical to their nutrition, food security and economic stability, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game

""People who are consuming walrus need to be aware that there is a possibility of being exposed to this parasite,"" said Yuri Springer, a co-author of the report and an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer for the Alaska Division of Public Health.

""They need to be aware of the types of symptoms they would be experiencing should they be infected, and they need to know that if they are infected, they can seek medical care to alleviate those symptoms,"" he said.

All 10 people affected in the Alaska outbreaks have recovered.

If a human or animal eats meat infected with Trichinella cysts, the CDC says, their stomach acid dissolves the hard covering of the cysts, releasing the worms, which then pass into the small intestine.

The worms mate and lay eggs that develop into immature worms, which travel through the arteries and into the muscles. There, they curl up and return to their original cyst formation, and the life cycle continues.

The first symptoms of trichinellosis can include abdominal issues such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and stomach pain. Further symptoms may include headaches, fevers, chills, cough, facial swelling, aching joints and muscle pain, caused by inflammation in the muscles from the worms burrowing through.

Tourists are not at risk of getting the infection from eating walrus, Springer said, because consumption takes place solely in coastal villages.

Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, only Alaska Natives are allowed to hunt and consume walrus, polar bears and several sea species, according to the report. It is not commercially available or served at restaurants.

""But we definitely have folks coming up from time to time to hunt bear. That's part of recreational hunting,"" Springer said. ""And I believe those persons may potentially be at risk if they consume meat from the harvested bear. So, yeah, those folks should definitely be aware of the risk of exposure.""

Anyone in the lower 48 who hunts and consumes wild game -- including bear, boar and mountain lion -- is susceptible, Springer said.

Trichinellosis and its impact

Trichinellosis used to be more common in the US, mostly caused by the ingestion of undercooked pork, according to the CDC.

The number of cases began to decline in the mid-20th century, after better sanitation management was implemented in the pork industry.

Infection has become increasingly rare, with an average of 15 cases per year reported in the US between 2008 and 2012, according to the CDC.

Globally, more than 65 000 cases and 42 deaths were reported across 41 countries between 1986 and 2009, one study reports. Pork was the major source of infection, but wild game was also frequently reported.

In 1975, there was an outbreak of trichinellosis in Alaska when 29 people ate walrus meat and most became ill, according to a study . Between that time and the latest illnesses, outbreaks occurred only in 1992 and 2002. Forty-four percent of these cases were connected to walrus consumption, and the rest were either related to bear or seal consumption, or had unidentified causes.

Springer said officials are not entirely sure what has caused the decline since 1975 or the rise of the new outbreaks, but there are a few possibilities. These include the timing and location of walrus hunting, changes in the parasitic burden in walrus populations, methods used to store and handle walrus meat, and reporting practices among ill persons.

The first recent outbreak occurred in 2016, when five coastal villagers who had consumed walrus meat that was raw or pan-fried to ""medium"" rare complained of symptoms, the report said.

Blood tests indicated that these cases had eosinophilia cells in their blood, a disease-fighting blood cell that is a common sign of parasitic infection. They were treated with anti-parasite medication and informed of the dangers of consuming undercooked or raw meat.

In 2017, five more villagers were diagnosed, and similar protocols were followed.

Dr. Daniel Eiras, assistant professor of infectious disease at NYU Langone Medical Center, who was not a part of the new CDC study, said he is skeptical of the use of an antibody blood test in diagnosing the disease.

""Antibody testing for trichinella, for many of these worm infections, is not great,"" Eiras said. ""There are a lot of false negatives, so you can't really rely on antibody testing.""

But the symptoms that were reported, as well as the cases' similarity to previous ones, are related to the infection, he said.

Spreading the word

A public service announcement has been distributed throughout the areas of Alaska impacted by the outbreak, as well as other coastal villages that could be affected in the future, Springer said.

The CDC report stresses the importance of being culturally sensitive when addressing the issue in areas where subsistence hunting is prevalent. This enables ""members of the target population to make informed decisions that integrate their traditional practices with their awareness and tolerance of risks,"" the report said.

Springer said he and his colleagues have let affected populations know about the ways in which they can reduce their risk of infection. They have informed them that the parasite can be killed only by thoroughly cooking the meat, not by freezing, drying or smoking it.

""Once we explained those things to the patients, as well as other members of the community, they were very understanding and receptive to the information,"" he said."

Prime Minister Theresa May's failure to win an outright majority in a snap national election last month has cast doubt on her capacity to lead Britain out of the EU, sharpening a debate on what sort of exit deal the government should seek.      ""I'm beginning to think that Brexit may never happen,"" Cable told the BBC on Sunday.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-emissions-netherlands-idUSKBN19V1EL?il=0,"JEEP, SUZUKI MAY HAVE VIOLATED EMISSIONS RULES: DUTCH WATCHDOG","ZOETERMEER, Netherlands (Reuters) - Dutch prosecutors said on Monday they will investigate possible misuse of vehicle emissions software by Suzuki (7269.T) and Fiat Chrysler's (FCHA.MI) Jeep. They were responding after the Dutch road authority (RDW)  found that the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Suzuki Vitara models produced unacceptably high levels of toxic emissions during road tests.   The RDW said that there are approximately 27,000 of the Jeeps and 42,000 of the Suzukis on European roads. The RDW said in a statement that its tests of more than a dozen car makers in the wake of the Volkswagen emissions scandal had singled out Jeep and Suzuki. Other manufacturers were not found to have violated regulations. The Dutch agency has been investigating what it called ""impermissible defeat devices"" for the past year, following the disclosure in the United States in 2015 that Volkswagen had used software to alter its emissions during testing. The RDW's investigation was centered on nitrogen oxide emission levels in diesel cars that appeared much higher than legally allowed during road driving rather than under laboratory test conditions. The agency said that in all cases carmakers argued that the reason for the discrepancy was software intended to protect the motor from harm under certain conditions. Such software is permissible under current European law and the agency no longer refers to it as a ""defeat device"" but uses the term ""impermissible software"" for when the pollution seems out of proportion with any need to protect the engine. ""For the 14 other carmakers we were able to get to the core of the matter and ask all the questions that we wanted and got satisfactory answers,"" said Maarten Balk, Manager for Licensing and Supervision at the RDW.  ""But not for these two, up to the present.""  Suzuki representatives in Europe could not immediately be reached for comment. Jeep representatives did not immediately respond to an email request for comment. The RDW said Suzuki Vitaras appeared to emit much more nitrogen oxide after a short time on the road. The company has offered a fix and is currently rolling it out for the roughly 8,000 Vitara models on Dutch roads. The Jeep Grand Cherokee appeared to emit higher levels of pollutants when its engine was hot, the RDW said. There are very few of them in the Netherlands, and the model is no longer in production.  Jeep has proposed a software fix for the Cherokees this month, but the RDW hasn't had a chance to evaluate it yet. RDW Director Paul Dietz said that this is the first time his agency has taken such an action.  He said the agency has no power to levy fines, that will be up to prosecutors. The RDW will continue to pressure the two firms to offer remedies and follow up to make sure the offending models are retrofitted. European cars in the future will have to comply with a road test, rather than a laboratory test, he said, removing the motive for installing software that tries to beat the test.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/10/health/hospital-sleep-noisy-alarms-study/index.html,SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF SLEEP IN HOSPITALS,"(CNN) When Dr. Joseph Schlesinger 's mother was in the hospital, it was hard to speak with her by phone above the beeps and blips of medical devices. It was even harder for her to get some shut-eye.

""She couldn't sleep at all,"" said Schlesinger, an assistant professor of anesthesiology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. ""In fact, it was very disorienting for her in the hospital.""

A noisy hospital -- not to mention interruptions by doctors and nurses and light exposure -- can make it difficult to rest when people need it most, according to researchers. And the result of a noisy hospital isn't just a groggy patient; it can also negatively affect your health, experts warn.

""Hospitals can be as loud as 72 decibels. That's like trying to talk to somebody standing next to a vacuum cleaner,"" Schlesinger said.

The World Health Organization recommends that hospital noise not exceed 30 decibels at night and 35 decibels during the day. A 2005 study at Johns Hopkins found no location in the hospital to be in compliance with WHO standards; average sound levels were in the 50 to 60 decibel range. Some parts of the hospital peaked much higher

Schlesinger has his sights set on cutting out some of the noise and getting his patients to sleep. In Vanderbilt's three-story echo-proof sound chamber, he's testing medical device sounds that are easier on the ears. In the chamber, a ring of speakers surrounds a single chair, testing a variety of sounds from different angles. The sounds, he said, should be ""alerting ... not jarring.""

But Schlesinger is also taking the reverse approach: preventing patients from hearing the device alarms that are already there. He is developing an earbud that can do just that.

""What I wanted to do was take the alarms out of the environment for the patient,"" he said. ""They don't need to hear them, and I want them to sleep.""

Schlesinger presented the pilot device last month at the International Conference on Auditory Display : a small black box connected to a microphone, a pair of headphones and a keyboard to input commands. Because medical devices often have narrow, high-pitched frequencies, a basic filter can clip out those noises without distorting other sounds, like human speech. Schlesinger said he is working with engineers to develop a standalone prototype that would be in-ear and have no delay.

Schlesinger said it's important that the device not muffle or distort other sounds, which can be disorienting for the patient. This is why simple earplugs may not always be the best choice, he added.

Products like Here One earbuds have similar technology, but Schlesinger hopes that his prototype will be better-suited for the health-care environment.

""At first glance, I am excited about this, and I do think it's innovative,"" said Erica Ryherd, associate professor of architectural engineering at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln who specializes in health-care design. Ryherd is not involved in Schlesinger's project.

More research will need to be done on how well the earbuds work, how patients respond to them and how comfortable they are to wear long-term, Ryherd added.

""My concern is that we just don't forget about the other things that are problematic,"" she said.

An earbud, she said, wouldn't change the source of the sound or how hospitals are designed. For example, hospitals often have hard, resonant floors that echo and propagate noise. To combat this, some have incorporated new materials into walls and ceiling tiles that can dampen sound but that are still hygienic and cleanable, Ryherd said.

""Hospitals do seem to be getting noisier as time goes on,"" she added, but alarms are hardly the only noise around. Between the bustle of people, carts rolling down the hallway and even the occasional helicopter, there's a lot going on in a dense space.

But medical devices do have certain acoustic features -- like their pitch, loudness and repetitiveness, she said -- that make them stand out from the din in order to alert doctors and nurses when something is amiss.

Louder noise in the hospital may have led to an arms race of even louder alarms, all clamoring to be heard over each other. Some researchers call this an ""acoustic feedback loop.""

The problem, Schelsinger said, is that many alarms are useless.

In one study of a single intensive care unit, for example, only 15% of alarms were considered ""clinically relevant."" About 40% were just plain wrong. Some of these noises only end up alarming the patients, Schlesinger said; doctors may know which noises require them to spring into action, but patients may think they're being ignored.

The end result, Schlesinger said, is that noisy, restless nights in the hospital can be disorienting for patients. This may especially be the case in the intensive care unit (ICU), where some of the most serious patients are monitored but which also happens to be one of the louder places in the hospital, he said.

The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services asks about nighttime quietness on its patient satisfaction survey . This may give hospitals a financial incentive to turn down the volume, as survey scores are tied to reimbursements.

""You can't take away patient monitoring -- that's critical -- but it's not really working for the patients,"" Ryherd said. ""I can't think of too many people I've talked to that have enjoyed the sound environment of the hospital."""

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-azure-idUSKBN19V1KQ,MICROSOFT TO OFFER LOCAL VERSION OF AZURE CLOUD SERVICE,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Monday unveiled a new service that allows customers to use its cloud technology on their own servers, part of the company's efforts to refocus its product line to compete more effectively with rivals Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google. The world's biggest software maker is looking to carve out a niche among customers who cannot or do not want to move all their computing operations to the massive shared data centers that are collectively known as the cloud.  One of the key differentiations we have with Azure versus our two biggest competitors in the cloud platform space is our ability to support true hybrid solutions, Judson Althoff, Microsoft's executive vice president of worldwide commercial business, told Reuters.  Azure is Microsoft's cloud-computing platform, pegged by most market share studies as second in cloud computing behind Amazon Web Services. Dell EMC, Lenovo Group Ltd and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co will provide new servers and equipment needed to run the service, Microsoft said. The companies will ship the first systems to customers in September. Julia White, corporate vice president of Azure, said that the new service, called Azure Stack, is aimed at businesses that want to use Azure but have specific needs for a localized version of the software.  Azure Stack is an extension of Azure, White said. Its not a replacement for your legacy private cloud. White said Azure Stack could be used by companies with operations in remote locations where it can be difficult to get an internet connection, such as oil rigs or cruise ships, or those in regions with regulations that require that data be kept locally. Weve seen a lot of pent-up demand from end-user customers as well as third-party providers who are anxious to deploy this solution, said Gartner analyst Ed Anderson. I anticipate that this offering will provide a significant boost to Microsofts overall cloud business.     Microsoft also announced Microsoft 365, a service that allows customers to purchase the Office 365 productivity suite, Windows 10 and other services in one bundle.      The product announcements, part of the company's Inspire customer conference in Washington, come just days after news that Microsoft plans to lay off thousands of sales reps.  Microsoft is reorganizing to simplify its sales and marketing efforts and put more emphasis on partnerships with services companies such as KPMG.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-07/cross-asset-quants-bitten-by-fed-facing-worst-losses-in-a-decade,CROSS-ASSET QUANTS ARE FACING THEIR WORST LOSSES IN A DECADE,"Hawkish signals from central bankers have punished stocks and bonds alike in the past week.Also punished: investors who make a living operating in several asset classes at once. Theyve been stung by the concerted selloff that lifted 10-year Treasury yields by 25 basis points and sent tech stocks to the biggest losses in 16 months. Among the hardest-hit were systematic funds who -- either to diversify or maximize gains -- dip their toes in a hodgepodge of different markets all at the same time.Losses stand out in two of the best-known quant strategies, trend-following traders known as commodity trading advisers, and risk parity funds. CTAs dropped 5.1 percent over the past two weeks, their worst stretch since 2007, according to a Societe General SA database of the 20 largest managers. The Salient Risk Parity Index dropped 1.8 percent, the most in four months.To a category of critics, its an environment where the potential for snowballing losses becomes greater, as the overseers of such funds take steps to reduce risk. So many face losses at once, the theory goes, that a chain reaction of selling ensues with the potential to whack markets further.So far, theres no clear indication thats happening. Selling in U.S. equities has been confined mostly to tech shares, with financial stocks rising toward 10-year highs. Bonds yields have spiked, but remain below levels seen in May.Any systematic selling was probably drowned out by discretionary managers, according to Roberto Croce, director of quantitative research at Salient Partners LP.I dont think we can say that the moves in the market are due to them, Croce said. Some portion of the investing base freaks out and runs for the hills, but these types of portfolios tend to snap back quickly if you dont take any risk off. Its much more likely to be discretionary investors that are fleeing whatever theyre holding without a plan.Its far from clear risk-parity and CTA funds react to the same set of inputs. While both invest in multiple asset classes and employ leverage, risk parity tends to be a slower and more passive strategy, aiming to engineer a smoother ride by giving smaller weightings to higher-volatility assets. CTAs, a type of managed futures strategy, follows short-term trends and tends to be more volatile and less correlated to the market.Risk parity would only unload positions quickly if managers kicked in some type of stop loss, which only a few do, according to Croce.That may be true for the biggest players, but doesnt account for the actions of a less illustrious category of risk parity funds, many of which have started to unwind, according Brean Capital LLCs Peter Tchir.I dont think this move has caused much of an unwind from true risk parity funds, but much more from the homebrew or risk parity lite crowd -- making the real fun just beginning, Tchir wrote in a note Thursday. Risk parity selling should kick in when expected volatility of the strategy exceeds target volatility of the strategy.As employed like Bridgewater Associates LPs All Weather Fund, risk parity holds consistent levels of exposures. When it rebalances, the fund buys assets that have fallen and sells ones which have gained -- hardly a recipe for disaster. AQR Capital Management LLC does use a risk management strategy to gradually reduce exposure when returns are very poor, but that hasnt kicked in all year, according John Huss, a portfolio manager on the risk parity team.Were not trying to chase one day or one week moves, Huss said. When there are larger shifts in exposure, like the way we were positioned in 2008 versus 2012 with really noticeable changes in size, they tend to happen more slowly over time.CTAs may be a bigger threat. Theyre large -- Barclays PLC estimates them to be about 7 percent of hedge fund industry assets -- and react quickly. Take $1.4 billion Quest Partners LLC, which runs mostly managed futures funds. Before last week the firm was mostly long Treasuries, and has already flipped to a short position, according to Nigol Koulajian, co-founder and chief investment officer.Last weeks pain wasnt as clear cut as a selloff in fixed income for some trend-followers. The managed futures fund at Salient, for example, suffered from a short position in agricultural commodities after wheat futures rallied to four-year highs.Momentum trading can create systemic risks. CTAs are a good example, theyll ride the trend up and ride the trend down, said Maneesh Shanbhag, who co-founded $500 million Greenline Partners LLC after five years at Bridgewater. Connecting that to risk parity, the more basic idea will not cause instability in markets. But a levered risk parity strategy is at risk of all asset classes falling.On the surface, its strange that both strategies suffered over the past week since theyre supposed to behave differently. A classic risk parity strategy is always long fixed income, equities and inflation risk assets. But as momentum threw its weight behind stocks and bonds, many CTAs took a similar long position.It gets worse zeroing in on CTAs: about half of the assets are controlled by 10 managers, who are about 98 percent correlated, meaning same-way bets will indeed affect the market, according to Quests Koulajian.CTAs who have adapted to this market environment are trading more and more long-term, and their position sizing has grown, Koulajian said. Many people are using exactly the same strategy, and as theres a reversal in trends, theyre impacting the market significantly."
http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/10/media/white-house-correspondents-association-breitbart-news/index.html,WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS ASSOCIATION CONSIDERS RULE CHANGE THAT COULD ICE OUT BREITBART,"A proposed change to the White House Correspondents Association's bylaws could keep Breitbart News reporters out of the group's decision-making process.

The WHCA is set to vote this week on a measure that would require its ""regular members"" -- those who vote and hold elective office within the group -- to be credentialed through the Congressional Standing Committee, or to work with or for an organization that is.

That could effectively mean barring reporters with Breitbart, which earlier this year was denied congressional press passes, from that level of membership in the WHCA.

Charlie Spiering, Breitbart's White House correspondent, was one of six journalists who signed a letter opposing the bylaw change that was circulated to WHCA members over the weekend.

""The WHCA Board has in most cases done a great job in advocating for journalists' access, and showing respect to all members. The proposed bylaws change regarding membership is an unfortunate exception,"" the group said in the letter. ""That's because the bylaws change would mean some members and hard pass holders who regularly cover the White House will not have full participation in the organization that is supposed to represent them regarding access among other things.""

The letter was also signed by liberal commentator Bill Press and longtime White House correspondent Connie Lawn, along with reporters for conservative outlets Newsmax, Circa and The Daily Signal. The signatories urged their colleagues to vote no on the proposal or, alternatively, asked the WHCA to consider grandfathering in existing regular members.

The deadline for members to vote on the bylaw change is Friday. Members will also have an opportunity to debate the proposal at a town hall meeting on Monday evening.

Press, a regular member of the WHCA whose membership would not be affected by the change, told CNN that ""there's a lot of unrest among members"" over the proposal. He and other opponents have asked for the vote to be postponed.

Jeff Mason, a White House correspondent for Reuters who is president of the WHCA, told CNN that the Congressional Standing Committee is the ""gold standard"" for credentialing in Washington, D.C.

The WHCA is not in charge of granting credentials at the White House, but it advocates for press access to the White House, provides scholarships for some journalism students and is perhaps best known for sponsoring its annual dinner every spring.

Mason said that the WHCA does not issue credentials, and that the rules for associate members will not change.

The letter opposing the proposal noted that associate members cannot vote in board elections or for future bylaw changes, among other disadvantages.

""Whether it's eligibility for pool coverage, competing for a journalism awards, qualifying to apply for a briefing room seat or work space, an associate member has fewer opportunities for access than a Full Member,"" the letter said.

Mason said that the change ""would affect a small handful of regular members.""

""We gave all of them a heads up,"" he said. ""We've also given them a chance to voice their opposition in a public way.""

One member who might be affected is Spiering.

That's because Breitbart was denied permanent congressional press passes in April over concerns about its ties to both the Mercer family, who are Republican benefactors and part owners of the right-wing outlet, and to the Government Accountability Institute, a conservative nonprofit that was co-founded by former Breitbart chairman and current White House strategist Steve Bannon.

At that time, the Standing Committee of Correspondents of the Senate Press Gallery said it tabled Breitbart's application until it could prove that it met the requirements under a rule requiring publications to be ""editorially independent of any institution, foundation or interest group that lobbies the federal government, or that is not principally a general news organization."""

Police and paramilitary soldiers fired tear gas to disperse the crowds.The protesters responded by hurling rocks at troops. No one was immediately reported injured in the clashes.While Kashmir has remained on edge, the Indian and Pakistani armies, which regularly trade fire and blame across the de-facto militarized frontier that divides the disputed territory between them, fired at each other's positions, killing three civilians and an off-duty soldier, officials said.Pakistan's military said two civilians were killed and three others wounded in the Indian army's ""unprovoked"" firing and shelling at two places along the highly militarized Line of Control.India's military said an off-duty army soldier visiting home was killed along with his wife after a shell fired from the Pakistani side hit their home in Poonch sector. Army spokesman Lt. Col. Manish Mehta called it an ""unprovoked"" violation of the 2003 cease-fire between India and Pakistan.India has accused Pakistan of arming and training the rebels, which Pakistan denies.Government forces for the second day sealed off the hometown of the 22-year-old Burhan Wani, who was killed along with two associates in a gunbattle with Indian troops last year. Witnesses said security forces ordered residents in southern Tral town to stay indoors.""I've never seen so many soldiers in aggressive posturing enforcing a curfew in my town. This is unprecedented restriction,"" resident Mohammed Hanief told The Associated Press by phone.Troops laid steel barricades and coiled razor wire on roads and intersections to cut off neighborhoods as authorities anticipated widespread protests. They also shut mobile internet services as part of the lockdown to stop activists from rallying online support.""We're enforcing strict restrictions to deal with any law and order issues,"" said S.P. Vaid, the region's police chief.Separatist leaders, who challenge India's sovereignty over Kashmir, called for a strike and protests to honor Wani. Most of the top leaders have either been detained or put under house arrest.Wani's killing had set off months of protests and deadly clashes across the region, during which at least 90 people were killed and thousands injured, while hundreds among them were blinded and maimed in the firing of shotgun pellets by government forces.Wani, who attracted dozens of new recruits while using Facebook and other social media sites, had rejuvenated Hizbul Mujahideen, the largest of Kashmir's militant groups. Its topmost leader based in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, Syed Salahuddin, was recently designated as the ""global terrorist"" by the U.S.The death of Wani and the public fury it caused made the armed rebellion mainstream in Kashmir and gave new life to the militant movement that had withered in recent years, reduced to just about 100 fighters in scattered rebel outfits. Officials say that since his killing, at least 100 young men have joined rebel ranks, some of them after snatching weapons from soldiers and police.It also cemented a shift in public behavior by displaying anger at Indian rule openly and violently when troops raid villages and towns to hunt rebels. Villagers who had learned to hide any sympathy they felt for fighters now speak of them openly with reverence and warmth and also engage in deadly clashes with government forces during their counterinsurgency operations.Rebel groups have been fighting since 1989 for Kashmir's independence or merger with neighboring Pakistan. Nearly 70,000 people have been killed in the fighting and the ensuing Indian crackdown.Anti-India sentiment runs deep among the region's mostly Muslim population and most people support the rebels despite a decades-long military crackdown.___Associated Press writer Zarar Khan in Islamabad, Pakistan contributed to this report."

http://cnn.com/2017/07/05/health/charlie-gard-explainer/index.html,CHARLIE GARD: BRITISH BABY AT THE CENTER OF GLOBAL DEBATE,"London (CNN) Eleven-month-old Charlie Gard has irreversible brain damage and cannot see, hear, move or even cry, doctors say. Yet this terminally ill British baby is at the middle of a global ethical argument over whether he should live or die, an argument that has attracted the attention of Pope Francis and US President Donald Trump.

Why is this case controversial?

Charlie has an extremely rare degenerative condition called mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. His doctors in Britain want to take him off life support, arguing that he has no hope of surviving without assistance and that he should be allowed to die in dignity. But Charlie's parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates, want the hospital to release their baby into their custody so they can take him to the United States for an experimental treatment.

The case has resurfaced a decades-old debate over euthanasia and the use of life support, issues that have been fought in most corners of the world and that have often seen medical and religious arguments collide.

There is some legal uncertainty, too: Under British law, parental responsibility includes the right to give consent for medical treatment, according to the British Medical Association. However, parental rights are not absolute, and in cases in which doctors and parents disagree, the courts may exercise objective judgment in a child's best interest.

How was the decision made to end life support?

Gard and Yates lost their appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in France, which ruled June 27 that the hospital could discontinue Charlie's life support. They had already lost an appeal to the UK Supreme Court.

Now, the date Charlie's life support will be switched off appears to be up in the air, as the hospital is allowing the parents to spend more time with their child.

On Wednesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May expressed her sympathy for the baby's parents, saying she understood why they would want to explore all options for their child. But she also defended the hospital, saying that it would consider any offers on new information that would benefit the baby.

""I also know that no doctor wants to be placed in the terrible position where they have to make such heartbreaking decisions,"" she said.

Why has the Pope intervened?

The Pope spoke out on the issue Sunday after the head of his bioethics panel, Vincenzo Paglia, said that while the Catholic Church was against active euthanasia, it must accept that medicine had its limits and that ""disproportionate"" medical procedures should be avoided.

Paglia's comments reportedly upset some conservative Catholics, who argued that they advocated euthanasia and were patronizing to Charlie's parents.

The Vatican issued a statement Sunday that said the Pope felt the parents should be allowed to ""accompany and treat their child until the end.""

""He is praying for them, in the hope that their desire to accompany and care for their own child until the end will be respected,"" the statement said.

On Tuesday, a Vatican-owned pediatric hospital in Rome offered to take Charlie into its care. But British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told his Italian counterpart, Angelino Alfano, that Charlie would not be moved to the Vatican hospital.

Johnson told Alfano that ""this was a deeply tragic and complex case for all involved and said it was right that decisions continued to be led by expert medical opinion, supported by the courts, in line with Charlie's best interests,"" a ministry spokeswoman said.

What's Donald Trump offering?

The case of Charlie Gard has also captured the attention of US President Trump, who on Monday offered US support for the baby.

""If we can help little #CharlieGard, as per our friends in the U.K. and the Pope, we would be delighted to do so,"" he wrote on Twitter.

Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.

Trump did not elaborate on how the US might help the child, but a US doctor has agreed to carry out an experimental treatment called nucleoside bypass therapy.

Yates said in a statement that she was taking support from Trump and the Pope seriously.

""The support from the Pope and the President has given us hope. They are traditional men who believe in the family. They believe in our case and understand why we believe it is right to continue fighting so hard to save Charlie,"" she said.

As the parents explained in their fundraising efforts, the therapy is an oral medication that provides Charlie with naturally occurring compounds that his body is not able to produce. His parents hope that the medicine might repair his flawed mitochondrial genes. Mitochondrial DNA depletion has a poor prognosis and leads to weakened muscles and organ dysfunction, among other symptoms.

According to bioethicist Julian Savulescu of the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics, the experimental therapy offers a very small chance of some improvement. It has never been used to treat this form of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, though it has proved beneficial to patients with a different form of the disease."
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-chicagostockexchange-m-a-chongqing-re-idUSKBN19V22Z,LAWMAKERS URGE SEC TO STOP CHICAGO STOCK EXCHANGE'S CHINA DEAL,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Eleven members of Congress asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday to stop the sale of the Chicago Stock Exchange to a group led by China-based investors, saying the regulator lacks the ability to monitor the foreign buyers.   The proposal to sell privately owned CHX for an undisclosed amount to a consortium led by Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group (CCEG) has drawn attention because it would be the first time a U.S. exchange has been bought by Chinese investors. There are also U.S. investors in the group. ""With little or no insight and transparency into government-dominated Chinese markets, the SEC will be unable to monitor the ownership structure of CCEG after approval, leaving CHX open to undue, improper, and possibly state-driven influence,"" the Republican and Democratic lawmakers said in a letter to the SEC.   CHX declined to comment. The SEC, which reviews proposed mergers involving exchanges to ensure they comply with federal regulations and appropriately self-police their brokerage members, said in early June it would take up to another 60 days to make a decision on the sale. CHX is a niche player in the U.S. equities market, executing less than 0.5 percent of U.S. stock transactions.  Casin Group, a privately held company that invests in real estate development and financial holdings, said its long-term goal is to list Chinese companies in the United States through CHX, which has locations in Chicago and New Jersey. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which scrutinizes deals for potential national security concerns, approved the planned sale in December, but the SEC still needs to sign off for it to go ahead. CHX is one of 13 U.S. stock exchanges, including Intercontinental Exchange Inc's (ICE.N) New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O), and CBOE Holdings (CBOE.O)-owned Bats.

A defense official said the soldier was arrested over allegedly pledging support to ISIS

Washington (CNN) An FBI spokesman on Monday confirmed that a SWAT team arrested a soldier in Hawaii over the weekend and charged him with supporting ISIS.

FBI Honolulu spokesman Arnold Laanui confirmed the agents arrested Ikaika Erik Kang, a 34-year-old Army soldier stationed at Schofield Barracks on Saturday.

In a release, the FBI said it had worked closely with the Army in this case. The statement said the investigation by the FBI and the Army had been going on for more than a year.

The FBI said it believed he was a ""lone actor"" and that Kang was arrested for ""providing material support"" to ISIS.

Kang is an active duty Army air traffic control operator assigned to the 25th Infantry Division at Wheeler Army Airfield in Hawaii. Kang's service records showed he was deployed to Afghanistan from July 2013 to April 2014 and served in Iraq from March 2010 to February 2011. He has received a range of medals in the course of his service, including the Army Commendation Medal.

http://cnn.com/2017/07/06/health/opioid-prescriptions-cdc/index.html,"OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS DROPPED BUT REMAIN HIGH, CDC SAYS","(CNN) Opioids continue to be prescribed at high rates, a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds, even as drug overdoses remain the leading cause of accidental death in the country, killing more people than guns or car accidents.

""The bottom line is, we still have too many people getting too many opioid prescriptions for too many days at too high a dosage,"" said acting CDC Director Dr. Anne Schuchat.

Prescriptions are measured by morphine milligram equivalents, which uses morphine as a baseline to measure the equivalent prescribed opioid, which may be more powerful.

Opioids -- both legal, such as prescription oxycodone and hydrocodone, and illicit drugs, such as street fentanyl and heroin -- killed more than 33,000 Americans in 2015. Half of those deaths involved prescription narcotics.

""Reducing prescriptions is just one part of a bigger charge to address the overall problem. It's a very important piece of the puzzle,"" Schuchat said.

Prescription opioid-related overdose deaths and treatment of opioid use disorder have trended similarly to the increase in opioid prescriptions, which quadrupled from 1999 to 2010. Much of this increase has been attributed to the increase in opioids being used to treat chronic pain.

""Try to prevent people initiating opioids unless necessary,"" said Caleb Banta-Green, an associate professor of health services at the University of Washington who was not involved with the new CDC report. ""Physical and emotional stress and discomfort are common. We all experience them. Rarely are opioids the best treatment for short-term health conditions.""

If the pain is going to last only a week or two, he said, try over-the-counter pain relievers.

Every community is affected

The report, which is the first to offer a county-by-county breakdown of prescribing across the nation, found varied prescribing practices.

The report analyzed retail prescription data at the county level from 2006 to 2015. It found that the top prescribing counties had nearly six times the number of prescriptions as those with the lowest rates of prescriptions.

""Opioid prescribing varies as much from place to place as the weather, and even neighboring counties have major differences in prescribing levels,"" Schuchat said.

Residents of those counties with the highest prescription rates have a greater risk of opioid addiction, overdose and death as a result of the higher prescribing practices.

The counties with the highest levels of prescriptions tended to have larger white populations, higher rates of unemployment and greater numbers enrolled in Medicaid.

Previous reports have shown that rural areas have been particularly hard-hit, but that is not captured in this report. Schuchat explained that it's because the data are based on where the prescriptions were picked up, not where people with the prescriptions live. Rural areas don't have as many pharmacies, so many residents must travel to have their prescriptions filled.

But there are some places that seem to be succeeding. In Florida, where there have been major efforts to crack down on excessive opioid prescribing between 2010 and 2012, 80% of counties reported a decrease in prescriptions. Likewise, in Ohio and Kentucky, where providers are required to review a database of prescription information by way of monitoring, 85% and 62% of counties reported decreases in prescription practices.

The authors of the study also found that the average dose of prescriptions and the overall rate of prescriptions -- from 81.2 to 70.6 prescriptions for every 100 persons from 2010 to 2015 -- were trending downward.

However, the average length of days for prescriptions increased. The average days' supply prescribed increased 33%, from 13.3 days in 2006 to 17.7 in 2015. A previous study from the CDC found that prescriptions for eight or more days increased the likelihood of using a drug a year later to 13.5%. And although just less than 7% of all prescriptions exceed a month's dosage, using for 31 days or more increased the chances of long-term opioid use to 29.9%.

In an attempt to rein in the over-prescribing of these medications, the CDC established new guidelines for prescribing practices in 2016 emphasizing that non-opioid treatments should be considered first-line therapies for dealing with chronic pain in adults and should be used for chronic pain only when the benefits outweigh the risks. Because the new study looked at prescription data between 2006 and 2015, the study didn't account for the impact of these new recommendations.

However, in 2009, the American Pain Society and the American Academy of Pain Medicine released guidelines aimed at reducing prescribing habits by care providers. The US Department of Veterans Affairs and the US Department of Defense issued a similar set of guidelines in 2010 that focused on reducing prescribed dosages. Schuchat believes these sets of guidelines triggered some improvement, which is reflected in the new report.

Separately, some states -- Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York and Maine -- have adopted legislation that limits opioid prescriptions to seven days. This year, New Jersey became the strictest, limiting painkiller prescriptions to just five days.

The study also did not identify whether reducing the number of prescriptions translates directly to an overall reduction in the number of people abusing opioid drugs. The latest numbers from the CDC find that the number of overdoses due to heroin and illicit synthetics are on the rise. In fact, between 2014 and 2015, the percent of overdoses attributed to synthetic opioids, much of it attributed to illicit fentanyl, rose by 72% in one year.

""We know the country is experiencing the highest overdose rates ever recorded, and it's driven by prescription and illicit opioid use,"" Schuchat said. ""Improvements in prescribing (habits) are just the beginning, but we have so much work to do."""
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-trade-usa-idUSKBN19U08U?il=0,UK-U.S. TRADE DEAL WILL NOT MAKE UP FOR LEAVING THE EU: MINISTER,"LONDON (Reuters) - A post-Brexit trade deal with the United States would not be enough to make up for leaving the European Union, British justice minister David Lidington said on Sunday, tempering Prime Minister Theresa May's enthusiasm about the U.S. offer.  May had warmly welcomed assurances on Saturday by U.S. President Donald Trump that a ""very powerful"" trade deal with Britain would be reached ""very, very quickly"" after Britain leaves the EU. Seeking to reassert her authority over a Brexit process thrown into chaos by a botched snap election last month, May described talks on trade with Trump and other world leaders at a G20 meeting as a ""powerful vote of confidence"" in Britain.  But one of her senior ministers dampened that enthusiasm on Sunday, in a sign of the difficult task May faces in uniting her own party behind a single exit strategy as key legislation is due to enter parliament next week. ""It wouldn't be enough on its own, no,"" Lidington told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. ""But it would be a very good thing to have - as would trade deals with the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America."" The government has touted the ability to strike bilateral trade deals, rather than EU-wide deal negotiated by Brussels, as one of the key benefits of leaving the bloc. Lidington campaigned strongly for Britain to remain in the EU before the 2016 referendum, but has since said he accepts the outcome of that vote. The Confederation of British Industry, a business lobby group, also warned against placing too much emphasis on a potential deal with the United States. ""Not every trade deal is necessarily a good and fair trade deal for both parties,"" CBI President Paul Drechsler told Sky television.   ""The USA has one of the best negotiating teams in the world in terms of trade deals. We don't want to walk into a bear hug - I would be wary of trying to be too fast on a trade deal."" May is expected to make a speech on Tuesday marking a year since she inherited power following Britain's surprise vote to leave the EU. The speech is seen as an attempt to move on from a tumultuous 12 months in which May set out a hardline approach to leaving the EU and called an election, but then failed to persuade the public to back her and lost her outright majority in parliament.  She has struck a deal with a small Northern Irish political party to support her minority government. Her weakened status has led to speculation that members of her Conservative Party - historically split between eurosceptics and more pro-European members - would be prepared to oust her if they did not get their way. Party unity will be tested by legislation which is due to be presented to parliament next week, outlining the government's plan to translate all EU law in British law as part of its preparation for leaving. A report in the Sunday Times newspaper cited anonymous sources as saying pro-European lawmakers could demand concessions in the bill.  A separate report sourced to an unnamed Conservative in the Mail on Sunday also said a 'Kamikaze' group of Brexit-supporting Conservatives would be prepared to oust her and force a new election if she did water down her Brexit plans. Dismissing those reports, Lidington said: ""Ive been in parliament 25 years and almost every July a combination of too much sun and too much warm prosecco leads to gossipy stories in the media.""

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-opec-meeting-libya-nigeria-idUSKBN19V16W,"LIBYA, NIGERIA MAY ATTEND OPEC, NON-OPEC JULY MEETING","ISTANBUL/LONDON (Reuters) - Libyan and Nigerian officials may attend a joint meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC nations later this month as oil producers look for ways to cap rising production to help support oil prices. Both countries have boosted production since they were exempted from an OPEC-led deal to cut output, weighing on global prices LCOc1. This has prompted more talk among producers about including them in the pact. ""We have spoken to (OPEC Secretary General Mohammad) Barkindo and in the next two weeks there will be conversations with them (Libya and Nigeria) and possibly we will invite them to the technical summit,"" Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told reporters on the sidelines of an industry conference in Istanbul. Six ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC nations including Kuwait, Venezuela, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Oman will meet on July 24 in St Petersburg, Russia, to discuss the current situation in the oil market.  Nigeria's oil minister, Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, was invited to the meeting but is unable to attend due to another commitment, Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam al-Marzouq told reporters at the same Istanbul event. Instead, the group will probably ask a technical committee involving the six OPEC and non-OPEC members, which is due to convene before the ministers hold their talks, to meet Nigerian and Libyan representatives to discuss their production plans, he said. ""We extended the invitation but unfortunately there is a previous commitment for the Nigerian oil minister,"" the minister said. ""We did not talk about capping, at least we can talk about production plans right now,"" he added. The monitoring panel, called the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee which Kuwait chairs, could recommend expanding the pact to the wider group, which holds its next meeting in November.  Both Nigeria and Libya were given exemptions to the supply cut, under which OPEC, Russia and other non-OPEC producers are reducing their output by about 1.8 million barrels per day because their output has been curbed by conflict.  OPEC delegates have said bringing Nigeria or Libya into the production pact would likely focus on capping their output, rather than asking them to cut their supply so soon after it had recovered from involuntary curbs. Kachikwu has said that Nigeria was not opposed in principle to joining OPEC's production cap, but would have to wait and see if production returned to acceptable levels. OPEC has not been in touch with Libya on the issue of capping the country's output, an OPEC delegate said. The Libyan government has not received an invitation to attend the ministerial meeting in Russia, he added. In comments to Reuters on Monday, the head of Libya's National Oil Corporation did not indicate any willingness to cap output yet, saying Libya's humanitarian problems must be considered in any talks on the subject. NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla added Libya could assist with efforts to stabilize the market by informing OPEC about its plans to restore production.

Just Thursday, the Clayton Homes subsidiary, known for making factory-built houses, announced the largest acquisition in its push into on-site homebuilding.Greg AbelWhen it comes to such deals, however, theres one Buffett lieutenant that stands out: Greg Abel, the 55-year-old chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. BHE announced a $9 billion all-cash offer Friday to buy a reorganized Energy Future Holdings Corp., the parent company of Oncor Electric Delivery Co., Texass largest electricity-transmission operator. That follows massive investments in wind power and other infrastructure in the U.S. and Canada over the past several years.The latest deal shows a lot of confidence in Greg Abel, said Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones. This would be a sizable bolt-on acquisition to BH Energy.Abels emergence takes on added importance because Berkshire is preparing for a new generation of leaders to eventually replace Buffett, 86, who has run the company for most of his adult life. The energy executive is also a director at Kraft Heinz Co., the packaged-food company controlled by Berkshire and 3G Capital.In 2015, Berkshire Vice Chairman Charles Munger called Abel and Ajit Jain world-leading managers, stoking speculation that one could eventually lead Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire. Buffett hasnt publicly disclosed who is in line to succeed him.Jain, 65, specializes in deals where he takes on risk and premium revenue from other insurers, giving Buffett more funds to invest. Abel is known for his operational oversight. BHE had about 21,000 employees at the end of last year. It generated $2.3 billion of profit for Buffetts company in 2016, twice as much as in 2010.Abel and Buffett didnt immediately respond to requests for interviews on the latest deal.Buying Energy Future Holdings would add to that income and provide a broader base of assets on which Berkshire can earn a return. Oncor runs the largest network of electric distribution and transmission lines in Texas and delivers power to more than 3 million homes and businesses.This partnership combines the strengths of two companies that share a common goal of providing exceptional customer service and a commitment to invest in critical infrastructure, Abel said in the statement announcing the deal.Bolt-on deals are not without risk. The Lubrizol unit last year had $365 million of pretax losses tied to the disposition of an oilfields solutions unit that was created partly to house businesses purchased from Weatherford International Plc. In April 2016, Buffett called that transaction a big mistake.Buffett has come to favor regulated capital-intensive businesses. Its utilities and the BNSF railroad give Berkshire the chance to deploy huge sums of cash in projects that generate steady returns and tend to be recession-resistant.While the railroad industry consolidated long ago, ownership of electric utilities is more fragmented. That gives Berkshire opportunities to add to its stable. Berkshire has also become a major developer of wind and solar power, in large part because of valuable tax credits generated by the projects.Buffett pushed into the utilities industry with the purchase of Des Moines, Iowa-based MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. Abel was a rising executive at the power company. An accountant by training, hed led the companys U.K. business in the late 1990s and worked on several of its acquisitions. He was named CEO of the operation in 2008.Read more: Buffett Reshaping Berkshire Propels AbelSince then, he built the unit further with the purchase of Nevadas NV Energy for more than $5 billion and the acquisition of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.s AltaLink to expand in electricity transmission in western Canada. His operation was later renamed Berkshire Hathaway Energy, highlighting its growing importance within the conglomerate.Buffett assured shareholders at his annual meeting in May that hell continue to count on the energy executive for growth.Id be surprised if 10 years from now we dont have significantly more money in, not only wind and solar, but we probably own more utility systems than we own now, Buffett said, citing the extraordinary job by Abel and his team. Its hard to imagine a better-run operation."
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-usa-idUSKBN19V0SU?il=0,U.S. FOREIGN CHIEF TILLERSON ARRIVES IN GULF FOR TALKS ON QATAR CRISIS,"ISTANBUL/DOHA (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrived in Kuwait on Monday for talks aimed at resolving the crisis triggered by the the cutoff of links with Qatar by Saudi Arabia and Arab allies  allies.  In Doha, a Western diplomat said creation of a ""terror finance monitoring mechanism"" would feature in the talks, but declined to elaborate. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, UAE and Egypt imposed sanctions last month, accusing Doha of aiding terrorism, something it denies. The State Department said Tillerson, who forged extensive ties in the Gulf as CEO of ExxonMobil, would hold talks with leaders in Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.  He was flying from Istanbul where he attended an international petroleum conference. R.C. Hammond, a senior adviser to Tillerson, said he would explore ways to end a stalemate following Qatar's rejection of 13 demands issued as condition for ending sanctions. ""The trips to Saudi Arabia and Qatar are about the art of the possible,"" said Hammond, who added that the 13 demands ""are done"" and ""are not worth revisiting as a package. Individually there are things in there that could work"". The demands included the closing of Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based pan-Arab television network, and a Turkish military base in Qatar. Saudi Arabia and its backers, which accuse Al Jazeera of being a platform for extremists and an agent of interference in their affairs, have threatened further sanctions against the emirate. Al Jazeera denies the allegations. Riyadh and its allies accuse Qatar of financing extremist groups and allying with Iran, the Gulf Arab states' regional rival. Qatar denies that it supports militant organizations, and many experts see the blockade as an attempt by Saudi Arabia to rein in Qatars increasingly independent foreign policy. The crisis has hit travel, food imports to Qatar, ratcheted up tensions in the Gulf and sown confusion among businesses, while pushing Qatar closer to Iran and Turkey which have offered support. The United States worries the crisis could affect its military and counter-terrorism operations and increase the regional influence of Tehran, which has been supporting Qatar by allowing it to use air and sea links through its territory. Qatar hosts Udeid Air Base, the largest U.S. military facility in the Middle East, from which U.S.-led coalition aircraft stage sorties against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed support for Saudi Arabia in the dispute. Hammond said it was critical that not only Qatar, but Riyadh and its allies take steps to halt any financial support flowing to extremists groups, especially following the defeat of Islamic State in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul. ""It's a two-way street,"" he said. ""There are no clean hands here."" ""We want progress on terrorism financing. The president strongly believes that if you cut off financing, you cut off the ability of terror to take hold in new areas,"" Hammond said. Moreover, he said, ""the longer that this struggle is in place, the more opportunity there is for Iran."" Editing by Jeremy Gaunt"
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-10/south-africa-s-welfare-agency-scraps-minister-s-advisory-teams,Missing,"The South African Social Services Agency has scrapped the advisory groups that were set up to plan for the future of the countrys more than $11 billion of annual welfare payments.Letters were sent to the so-called work streams last week informing them of their termination, Sassa Chief Executive Officer Thokozani Magwaza said in an interview at Bloombergs Johannesburg office on Monday. Magwaza said he had informed Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini of the decision and hasnt yet received a response. The advisory groups reported directly to the minister, effectively creating parallel structures to the agencys management.The government is pushing to find a new system to pay welfare grants to more than 17 million recipients after the Constitutional Court in March allowed for a 12-month extension to the contract with Net1 UEPS Technologies Inc., after earlier finding the deal was invalid. Any interruption to the program could spark protests in poor communities where many households have no other income, and may hurt the ruling African National Congress ahead of 2019 elections.The groups, appointed by the Dlamini two years ago, failed to find solutions and the agency was unable to take over welfare distribution by April this year, according to Magwaza. The National Treasury had found that the setting up of the work streams was irregular.By the CEO taking this position it could be a response to the fact that so far those work streams have not produced the results desired, Bonita Meyersfeld, who heads the University of the Witwatersrands Centre for Applied Legal Studies, said by phone. From a constitutional point of view it is incredibly important that Sassa is able to advance its mandate and that requires a certain degree of independence.The decision may add to tension between Magwaza and the minister who contradicted each other in affidavits submitted to the Constitutional Court. Dlamini was asked by the court to explain why she shouldnt pay the costs of the legal case after the department, under her supervision, failed to find a replacement for Net1 after a 2014 ruling. A decision on her liability is yet to be made.The welfare agency plans to start phasing in a new contractor in November to comply with the court order, Dlamini told lawmakers in May. The ministers spokeswoman asked for emailed questions.The Treasury last week authorized Sassa to engage with the state-owned South African Post Office as the operator of the welfare-payment system, Magwaza said. While the Post office has said its willing, and has the capacity, to take over the payments, Sassa will still have to make sure the company can comply with the requirements, he said.National Treasury has agreed that Sassa engages the post office as the sole bidder, Sassa spokesman Paseka Letsatsi said by phone. For government to appoint any body there must be a formal tender process followed, but this time Treasury is saying we are giving you a deviation to engage with the Post Office. If that doesnt work out we can engage other bidders.The SAPOs Postbank obtained a provisional banking license in 2016 and has applied for a formal permit. If the Post Office fails to meet the full requirements, Magwaza said any company except Net1 will be considered, complying with the order by the Constitutional Court. Mark Barnes, the Post Offices CEO, said by phone that he hasnt received official confirmation from Treasury."

While occasionally guilty of pushing his protagonists' legendary reps a bit too hard, director Allen Hughes delivers a pair of Horatio Alger stories in one fascinating package.

Having spent several years working on this project, Hughes opens with the Brooklyn-born, fast-talking Iovine and Compton legend Dre entering into a $3-billion deal with Apple to acquire Beats Electronics in 2014. From there, it's back to their more humble beginnings, with Iovine breaking into the business on Bruce Springsteen's ""Born to Run"" and Dre making his name as a deejay before founding the hugely influential rap group N.W.A.

Both are credited with tenacious instincts and a golden gut, such as Iovine recognizing that the song ""Because the Night,"" an afterthought to Springsteen, would be a hit if Patti Smith recorded it.

Hughes (whose directing credits include the features ""Menace II Society"" and ""From Hell"" with brother Albert) has shot the documentary in a brisk, cinematic fashion, using rapid cuts between interview subjects and the musical score (which includes the theme from ""The Untouchables"") to add a sense of urgency to this unfolding history.

Although the portraits are favorable, they don't whitewash the thornier aspects of these complicated careers and lives, including Dre's brutal assault on journalist Dee Barnes. Hughes also takes a deep dive into the violent schism that roiled the rap industry and resulted in the death of Tupac Shakur.

The U.S. Supreme Court last month let the ban on travel from six Muslim-majority countries go forward with a limited scope, saying it could not apply to anyone with a credible ""bona fide relationship"" with a U.S. person or entity.  The Trump administration then decided that spouses, parents, children, fiancés and siblings would be exempt from the ban, while grandparents and other family members traveling from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen would be barred. Trump said the measure was necessary to prevent attacks. However, opponents including states and refugee advocacy groups sued to stop it, disputing its security rationale and saying it discriminated against Muslims. A Honolulu judge this week rejected Hawaii's request to clarify the Supreme Court ruling and narrow the government's implementation of the ban. Hawaii appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, saying in a filing on Friday that the appeals court has the power to narrow the travel ban while it decides how to interpret the Supreme Court's ruling. A three-judge 9th Circuit panel on Friday rejected that argument and said it did not have jurisdiction to hear Hawaii's appeal.  The 9th Circuit said the Honolulu judge could issue an injunction against the government in the future, if he believed it misapplied the Supreme Court's ruling to a particular person harmed by the travel ban.  But the judge did not have the authority to simply clarify the Supreme Court's instructions now, the appeals court said. In a statement, Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said he appreciated that the 9th Circuit ruled so quickly, and that the state will comply. The Justice Department declined to comment.  Justice Department lawyers have argued that its definition of close family ""hews closely"" to language found in U.S. immigration law, while Hawaii's attorney general's office said other parts of immigration law include grandparents in that group. The roll-out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued last week than in January when Trump first signed a more expansive version of the order.

http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/portugal-douro-luxury-presidential-train/index.html,THE WORLD'S TASTIEST RAIL JOURNEY,"Paul Ames, CNN Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Updated 10th July 2017

(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Dappled sunlight gleaming off its regal blue livery, Portugal's Presidential Train glides out of the medieval heart of Porto towards the Douro Valley on the start of a new addition to Europe's selection of luxury rail journeys -- a nine-hour gourmet excursion through one of the most beautiful wine regions.

Its oldest carriages were assembled in Parisian workshops 127 years ago to convey Portuguese kings and queens around their realm in high comfort.

Now the once-royal rolling stock takes paying passengers on a lavish day-trip through 200 kilometers (125 miles) of stunning scenery from Porto to the grand Quinta do Vesuvio estate on the far eastern edge of Douro wine country.

For most of the journey the train hugs the riverbank. Each curve reveals a different breath-stopping vista of the broad, blue Douro as it snakes through vine-covered slopes dotted with granite villages or the stately mansions of old wine-making families.

It doesn't come cheap. Tickets for riding this railroad are Ã¢ÂÂ¬500 ($560) -- compared to Ã¢ÂÂ¬24.60, if you take the regular train along the same line. The Presidential price includes some extras, though, starting with the fancy catering.

A succession of Michelin-starred chefs from Portugal and beyond are serving gourmet lunches to travelers on the 30 or so trips scheduled for spring and fall 2017. Their multi-course meals are partnered with prize-wining Douro wines.

Kicking off the show should've been Esben Holmboe Bang , who holds the distinction of being both the world's youngest and most northerly three-star chef. His restaurant Maaemo in the Norwegian capital Oslo is hallowed ground for devotees of new Nordic cooking.

Gastronomic revival

This is no express ride. The Presidential travels at a gentle pace.

Unhappily, Holmboe Bang broke a leg the day before he was due to fly down from Oslo.

His Irish sous-chef, Halaigh Whelan-McManus, had to gamely step in to save the show, ensuring the 60 or so passengers were served up a blend of Nordic knowhow and northern Portuguese seasonal products -- from an appetizer of onion puree infused with rhubarb oil and fiery Scandinavian akvavit, to strawberries and smoked custard for dessert.

The Presidential Train's gastronomic revival is the brainchild of businessman GonÃÂ§alo Castel-Branco. He fell in love when he saw the carriages languishing immobile in Portugal's railway museum.

""I had to get it back on the line, but couldn't work out how,"" Castel-Branco says.

""When my 10-year-old daughter suggested a restaurant, I told her 'that's a terrible idea, go to your room,' but when I woke up next morning, I thought, she's absolutely right.""

After much persuading, the national railway company agreed.

A try out last year saw the train running 10 trips with meals prepared by Dieter Koschina, chef of the two-star Vila Joya restaurant on Portugal's south coast.

This year the train is back, with 10 journeys scheduled through May and another 20 or so planned in the fall when the Douro vineyards come to life for the grape harvest.

Porto chef Pedro Lemos and JoÃÂ£o Rodriques, of Lisbon's Feitoria restaurant, are on track to cook for the remaining spring trips, but Castel-Branco has yet to reveal the fall lineup.

""This is something that works,"" says Castel-Branco. ""When you have this train and you have the Douro, this landscape, everything else is easy-peasy.""

Spectacular views

The oldest carriages were assembled in Parisian workshops 127 years ago.

The journey begins in Porto's SÃÂ£o Bento terminal, a temple to the golden age of rail, built in the early 1900s with a grand granite faÃÂ§ade in the French Beaux-Arts style.

Its cathedral-like concourse is clad with over 20,000 painted tiles depicting medieval Portuguese warriors battling their Spanish or Moroccan neighbors and other scenes of historical heroics.

With passengers all aboard, the train pulls out, heading straight into a tunnel running beneath the cafes and theaters of Porto's uptown Batalha district.

It emerges for a first, spectacular view of the Douro.

Cutting through the city, the river is crossed by the iron span of the 1877 Maria Pia Bridge, built by Gustave Eiffel, a French engineer better known for a certain tower in Paris. Below, passengers can glimpse brightly painted riverside mercantile houses and historic port wine lodges on the far bank.

For a while, the tracks head away from the river through Porto's eastern suburbs -- time to admire the train.

Portugal's royal family didn't have long to enjoy their luxurious carriages. The monarchy was toppled by a 1910 revolution, but the train rode on under the republic. It served Portugal's presidents until the 1970s.

Visiting dignitaries were also invited on board. Britain's Queen Elizabeth II used it to flit around Portugal during a state visit to her country's oldest ally in 1957.

Vintage comfort

The renovated train retains its original luxurious art-deco elegance.

One of the train's last trips was for the funeral of dictator AntÃÂ³nio de Oliveira Salazar in 1970, when it carried the body from Lisbon to his hometown of Santa Comba DÃÂ£o.

In following years the train lay neglected, until restoration work began in 2010 to recreate the art deco elegance enjoyed by heads of state after the last major refit in 1930.

Lovingly recreated, the presidential, ministerial and press carriages are filled with soft, velvety seating, as well as a bar wagon and two restaurant cars featuring wood panels and white linens. Attention to detail goes down to the vintage comfort of the restroom facilities.

These days a chunky 1960s diesel locomotive, resplendent in glossy blue with scarlet and white trim, pulls the train rather than the steam engine that powered Portugal's 19th-century monarchs.

Staff are already serving the first drinks -- a glass of crisp white from the Quinta do Vallado estate up the Douro -- as the train edges through the suburbs.

By the time it's up to the top speed of 80 kph (50 mph) -- the elderly train does not like to be hurried -- passengers are sipping a Vallado rosÃÂ© with that onion appetizer.

When the track meets the Douro again, by a broad stretch of water surrounded by the trellised greenery of vines destined to produce youthful vinho verde wines, the first course has arrived -- a delicate concoction of green peas, asparagus and elderflower.

Now the train is chugging into the Douro wine region proper: a land of venerable estates on hills rising precipitously from the riverbank. Terraces bolstered by rough stone walls are carved into the slopes to create the unique landscape.

Small waterfront stations glow with the blue-white-and-yellow designs in azulejos -- distinctly Portuguese ceramic tiles.

Climatic extremes -- temperatures regularly top 40 C (104 F) in summer, frost is common in winter -- explain why the train journeys are limited to the verdant spring and harvest time when the vines turn amber and crimson.

The Douro has been a protected wine region since the 18th century, producing the raw material for fortified ports and, increasingly, world-beating red and white table wines.

Several of which keep coming as the train continues its journey. At least seven different wines were served during the trip.

Between stops in the pretty wine shipping ports of RÃÂ©gua and PinhÃÂ£o, came reserva whites to accompany a flower-covered mackerel filet with apple and ramsons.

Then came pigeon breasts with wild mushroom sauce and roast celeriac, paired with the day's first red -- a smoky, spicy tipple made by Niepoort family, originally from the Netherlands, but making wines in the Douro since 1840.

Before dessert, the train reaches the Quinta do Vesuvio halt. A deserted platform in an achingly romantic spot where layers of low conical hills ripple to the river.

Bounded by vines, citrus groves and palm trees, the aristocratic mansion at the heart of the estate sits in splendid isolation on the south bank of the Douro.

Golden river

Named after an Italian volcano, Quinta do Vesuvio is a wine-tasting stop on the nine-hour journey.

Local lore says the estate got its name because one of its seven hills reminded a noble 19th-century owner of the volcano she'd gazed on during her Neapolitan honeymoon.

Passengers can relax in the riverside garden under the shade of orange trees; indulge in coffee, port and cigars while admiring the view from the patio; or head for the cool of the winery where there's a selection of hearty reds and rare ports on offer for tasting among the monumental stone basins still used for crushing grapes by foot.

There's more port on the return journey: Graham's 30-year-old Tawny to accompany some savory and sweet snacks -- locally smoked cold cuts, and fruit tarts featuring Norway's unique brunost cheese.

The trip is not without its teething troubles: in a region renowned for robust cooking -- Porto's signature dish is a mountainous mix of offal and beans -- some customers complained the delicate Scandinavian morsels could have been more substantial; there were gripes about slow service of the food, although the wine never stopped flowing; and a technical hitch meant a 90-minute delay getting back to Porto."

The 10th edition of the festival -- which relocated to Berlin in 2016 -- promises a full program of events, including seminars and talks from the likes of Archigram founder Sir Peter Cook and Zaha Hadid Architects director Patrik Schumacher.

The buildings nominated for the award are a mixed bunch -- the garish Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles is up against the contemplative Fitzroy Crossing Renal Hostel, a facility in the Australian Outback for indigenous residents suffering from end stage renal disease. But, there are clear themes on show, noticeably a growing respect for natural surroundings and the use of locally sourced materials.

The impact of climate change on design

Among the buildings which aim to blur the line between nature and the built environment are Amanda Levette's design for MAAT -- the new Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology in Lisbon -- a sweeping structure located on the outskirts of they city that compliments the vast body of water in front of it.

CEO John Mackey was facing the worst crisis in his companys history. On April 10, activist hedge fund Jana Partners had announced an 8 percent stake and was agitating for an overhaul of the struggling grocery chain, potentially including a sale.Thats when Mackey recalled reading a report that Amazon.com Inc. had considered trying to buy Whole Foods. A few days earlier, Bloomberg News reported that the e-commerce giant had mulled a bid last fall to help accelerate its push into the grocery business but didnt pursue a deal. That gave Mackey just the lifeline he needed.On April 21, the Whole Foods chief authorized an outside consultant to contact Amazon, a filing to U.S. regulators on Friday shows. The consultant offered to make an introductory phone call to a contact at Amazon.com to inquire whether there might be an interest in having an exploratory meeting between the companies, according to the filing, which provides details about the negotiations on the proposed merger.About two months later on June 16, the e-commerce titan and the upscale grocer that helped bring organic food into the mainstream announced a deal, with Amazon agreeing to buy Whole Foods for $42 a share, or about $13.7 billion.As the Amazon deal took shape, according to the filing, Whole Foods also entertained interest from at least four private equity firms as well as Company X, which met with Mackey and his advisers to discuss a potential deal at $35-$40 a share. That unnamed company was in fact the Albertsons grocery chain, according to a person familiar with the situation. Albertsons declined to comment.In the end, Whole Foods decided not to seek formal offers from its private equity suitors, fearing leaks and believing that Amazons offer would be better. Amazons initial offer was for $41 a share. Whole Foods countered at $45 and eventually accepted Amazons best and final offer of $42.Whole Foods shares were up less than 1 percent to $42.15. Amazon shares rose 1.3 percent to $977.59.In the aftermath of the news that Amazon and Whole Foods had agreed on a deal, the grocers shares traded above the offer price, fueling speculation that a rival bidder would emerge for Mackeys company.But the list of companies with the financial firepower to bid against Amazon is short, and with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. recently saying it would not bid, its increasingly unlikely that a rival bid will surface, according to Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones.The chances are pretty slim he said. I dont think it makes sense to get into a public bidding war with Amazon."
http://cnn.com/2017/07/06/health/how-sunscreen-works-partner/index.html,HOW SUNSCREEN WORKS,"Not so long ago, people like my Aunt Muriel thought of sunburn as a necessary evil on the way to a ""good base tan."" She used to slather on the baby oil while using a large reflector to bake away. Aunt Muriel's mantra when the inevitable burn and peel appeared: Beauty has its price.

Was she ever right about that price -- but it was a lot higher than any of us at the time recognized. What sun addicts didn't know then was that we were setting our skin up for damage to its structural proteins and DNA. Hello, wrinkles, liver spots and cancers. No matter where your complexion falls on the Fitzpatrick Skin Type scale , ultraviolet radiation (UV) from the sun or tanning beds will damage your skin.

Today, recognition of the risks posed by UV rays has motivated scientists, myself included, to study what's going on in our cells when they're in the sun -- and devise modern ways to ward off that damage.

What happens when sun hits skin

Sunlight is composed of packets of energy called photons. The visible colors we can see by eye are relatively harmless to our skin; it's the sun's ultraviolet (UV) light photons that can cause skin damage. UV light can be broken down into two categories: UVA (in the wavelength range 320-400 nanometers) and UVB (in the wavelength range 280-320 nm).

Our skin contains molecules that are perfectly structured to absorb the energy of UVA and UVB photons. This puts the molecule into an energetically excited state. And as the saying goes, what goes up must come down. In order to release their acquired energy, these molecules undergo chemical reactions -- and in the skin that means there are biological consequences.

We also know that UVA light penetrates deeper into the skin than UVB, destroying a structural protein called collagen. As collagen degrades, our skin loses its elasticity and smoothness, leading to wrinkles. UVA is responsible for many of the visible signs of aging, while UVB light is considered the primary source of sunburn. Think ""A"" for aging and ""B"" for burning.

DNA itself can absorb both UVA and UVB rays, causing mutations which, if unrepaired, can lead to non-melanoma (basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma) or melanoma skin cancers . Other skin molecules pass absorbed UV energy on to those highly reactive ROS and free radicals. The resulting oxidative stress can overload the skin's built-in antioxidant network and cause cellular damage. ROS can react with DNA, forming mutations, and with collagen, leading to wrinkles. They can also interrupt cell signaling pathways and gene expression.

The end result of all of these photoreactions is photodamage that accumulates over the course of a lifetime from repeated exposure. And -- this cannot be emphasized enough -- this applies to all skin types, from Type I (like Nicole Kidman) to Type VI (like Jennifer Hudson). Regardless of how much melanin we have in our skin , we can develop UV-induced skin cancers and we will all eventually see the signs of photo-induced aging in the mirror.

Filtering photons before the damage is done

The good news, of course, is that the risk of skin cancer and the visible signs of aging can be minimized by preventing overexposure to UV radiation. When you can't avoid the sun altogether, today's sunscreens have got your back (and all the rest of your skin too).

Sunscreens employ UV filters: molecules specifically designed to help reduce the amount of UV rays that reach through the skin surface. A film of these molecules forms a protective barrier either absorbing (chemical filters) or reflecting (physical blockers) UV photons before they can be absorbed by our DNA and other reactive molecules deeper in the skin.

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration regulates sunscreens as drugs. Because we were historically most concerned with protecting against sunburn, 14 molecules that block sunburn-inducing UVB rays are approved for use. That we have just two UVA-blocking molecules available in the United States -- avobenzone, a chemical filter; and zinc oxide, a physical blocker -- is a testament to our more recent understanding that UVA causes trouble, not just tans.

The FDA also has enacted strict labeling requirements -- most obviously about SPF (sun protection factor). On labels since 1971, SPF represents the relative time it takes for an individual to get sunburned by UVB radiation. For example, if it takes 10 minutes typically to burn, then, if used correctly, an SPF 30 sunscreen should provide 30 times that -- 300 minutes of protection before sunburn.

""Used correctly"" is the key phrase. Research shows that it takes about one ounce, or basically a shot glass-sized amount of sunscreen , to cover the exposed areas of the average adult body, and a nickel-sized amount for the face and neck (more or less, depending on your body size). The majority of people apply between a quarter to a half of the recommended amounts , placing their skin at risk for sunburn and photodamage.

To get high SPF values, multiple UVB UV filters are combined into a formulation based upon safety standards set by the FDA . However, the SPF doesn't account for UVA protection. For a sunscreen to make a claim as having UVA and UVB protection and be labeled ""Broad Spectrum,"" it must pass FDA's Broad Spectrum Test , where the sunscreen is hit with a large dose of UVB and UVA light before its effectiveness is tested.

This pre-irradiation step was established in FDA's 2012 sunscreen labeling rules and acknowledges something significant about UV-filters: some can be photolabile, meaning they can degrade under UV irradiation. The most famous example may be PABA . This UVB-absorbing molecule is rarely used in sunscreens today because it forms photoproducts that elicit an allergic reaction in some people.

But the Broad Spectrum Test really came into effect only once the UVA-absorbing molecule avobenzone came onto the market. Avobenzone can interact with octinoxate, a strong and widely used UVB absorber, in a way that makes avobenzone less effective against UVA photons. The UVB filter octocrylene, on the other hand, helps stabilize avobenzone so it lasts longer in its UVA-absorbing form. Additionally, you may notice on some sunscreen labels the molecule ethylhexyl methoxycrylene. It helps stabilize avobenzone even in the presence of octinoxate, and provides us with longer-lasting protection against UVA rays.

Next up in sunscreen innovation is the broadening of their mission. Because even the highest SPF sunscreens don't block 100 percent of UV rays, the addition of antioxidants can supply a second line of protection when the skin's natural antioxidant defenses are overloaded. Some antioxidant ingredients my colleagues and I have worked with include tocopheral acetate (Vitamin E), sodium ascorbyl phosophate (Vitamin C), and DESM . And sunscreen researchers are beginning to investigate if the absorption of other colors of light , like infrared, by skin molecules has a role to play in photodamage.

As research continues, one thing we know for certain is that protecting our DNA from UV damage, for people of every color, is synonymous with preventing skin cancers. The Skin Cancer Foundation, American Cancer Society and the American Academy of Dermatology all stress that research shows regular use of an SPF 15 or higher sunscreen prevents sunburn and reduces the risk of non-melanoma cancers by 40 percent and melanoma by 50 percent

We can still enjoy being in the sun. Unlike my Aunt Muriel and us kids in the 1980s, we just need to use the resources available to us, from long sleeves to shade to sunscreens, in order to protect the molecules in our skin, especially our DNA, from UV damage."
http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/10/politics/college-media-party-poll/index.html,POLL: PARTY DIVISIONS EXTEND TO IMPRESSION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,"Story highlights 58% of Republicans say colleges and universities are negative for the country

Gap between Democrats and Republicans on the media's impact has grown

Churches and religious organizations viewed most positively of five institutions tested

Washington (CNN) Think the pursuit of higher learning is immune from partisan polarization? Think again. A new poll from the Pew Research Center finds that colleges and universities are the latest institutions added to the list of those viewed through a partisan lens.

Overall, 55% say colleges and universities have a positive effect on the way things are going in the country, second to churches and religious organizations (59% positive) for positive impacts on the nation's life among the five institutions tested in the survey.

But in the last two years, there have been sharp changes in the way Republicans view America's colleges and universities. While Democrats continue to see them as an overwhelmingly positive force (72% say they have a positive effect on the country, about the same as in 2015), Republicans have had a near reversal. In September 2015, 54% of Republicans viewed colleges as a positive for the nation, but now, most Republicans (58%) say they are a negative.

The divide between voters who held college degrees and those who did not nearly defined last year's election campaign. A CNN study with the Kaiser Family Foundation last fall found a hint of the burgeoning GOP distaste for formal education. That survey asked those who did not hold a four-year college degree if having one would make their lives better, worse or no different at all. Among Democrats who did not have a degree, 70% said getting that B.A. or B.S. would make their lives better. Among Republicans in the same boat, just 48% agreed.

Some of the other partisan divides found in the poll were less surprising. Democrats are more positive about the impact of labor unions on Americans life, and Republicans were more positive about banks and other financial institutions.

In the world of fanfiction, where amateur writers spin new tales involving famous characters and other pop culture icons, anything can happen. While it's not as popular as, say, Snapchat or Katy Perry, fanfiction (also called fanfic) has a devoted following of superfans who've generated millions of stories on the internet.

Kids writing and reading: What's not to love? Well, when it comes to fanfiction, where the possibilities are limited only by imagination, there's a little more to the story.

A good portion of the fanfiction on the internet ranges in age-appropriateness from completely mild to nearly soft-core porn. And there are no barriers to reading it. Whether you're a writer or a reader, you'll come across words and images that are graphic.

If your kid is interested in writing fanfiction or just reading it, you'll want to take a look at the various sites and apps, including the most popular ones -- Wattpad, Tumblr, and WordPress -- that they might be using.

Each platform has its own rules, privacy settings, and publishing tools, which you'll want to review with your young writer to keep them safe as they explore their passion.

Review some of the key facts about fanfiction, important tips to keep in mind, and a rundown of some of the most popular platforms:

Fanfiction Facts

Fanfiction writers are fiercely protective. They know their hobby is a little nerdy and less valued in the publishing world. As a result, adherents bond over their mutual love of the subjects of their stories, as well as fanfic in general.

Fanfic is social. What's the point of writing if no one's going to read it? Fanfiction writers enthusiastically share their work and follow other writers. Part of the fun is the community that develops around specific characters, plot lines, authors, and subjects.

Fanfic can be really age-inappropriate. Not all of it is about sex -- but a lot of it is. (Get tips for managing exposure below.)

It could be the start of a career. Authors Meg Cabot (The Princess Diaries and Airhead) and Neil Gaiman (the Sandman series) have revealed that they've written fanfiction.

Devotees are vocal -- and can resort to cyberbullying. While a lot of followers are supportive, the comments, feedback, and fanfic forums can be heated and even cruel.

Fanfiction Lingo

Canon, non-canon/fanon. When stories use the facts of the original source material, it's considered ""canon."" Fanfiction that introduces new ideas -- for example, imagining Harry Potter as a muggle (when of course we all know he's a half-blood) is non-canon or ""fanon."" Fanfic writers are divided on whether their work should be canon or whether it's OK to go rogue.

Shipping. Much of fanfiction revolves around Much of fanfiction revolves around shipping , which is the romantic pairing of characters. Often, there's a call from fans to ""ship"" specific characters -- say, Harry Styles and Bella from Twilight.

Real-person fanfiction (RPF). No celebrity, character, or content -- including YouTube stars such as Shane Dawson and Jenn McCallister -- is off-limits in fanfiction. Videos of famous people reading fanfiction about themselves -- usually mockingly -- are a fixture of YouTube (and often are super cringeworthy).

Check the Fanspeak Dictionary for a complete list of terms.

Fanfiction Tips for Parents

Encourage writing. Writing -- even if the subject matter is a little blue -- is a positive form of self-expression.

Use privacy settings. Each tool offers different ways for users to protect their privacy, from encouraging pseudonyms (which has pros and cons; see below) to restricting who can read your work to limiting comments. Kids just starting out, for example, should use stricter settings, sharing only with known friends. Once kids get familiar with the tool they're using, you can help them ease up on the settings.

Share safely. You can never predict someone's reaction to what you write. Putting yourself out there can make you vulnerable. Not every kid is ready for that even if they think they are. Try to get them to start with a small audience and grow into their hobby.

Talk about sex. Sex, love, and romance are a big part of fanfiction. The tween and teen years are when adolescents start getting interested in sex, and if they like reading and writing, they'll naturally gravitate toward a genre that explores this topic. If they write sexy stuff, ask them to keep it private or extremely limited. Posting it could attract the wrong kind of interest from other users, and sharing it -- say, with friends at school -- may not go over well.

Don't insist on reading your kids' work. If they want to share it with you, great, but if not, let it go. Just check in every now and then.

Make sure kids respect platform rules. Most fanfic services don't allow porn, hate speech, or revealing personal information about living people.

Keep an eye on the fandom. Fanatics can become obsessive. Anything that interferes with your kid's mood, schoolwork, interests, and so on could mean that something is out of whack. Check in to make sure your kid has things in perspective.

Anne Marie Morris, who campaigned to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum, was describing her view of what could be done to ensure a good exit agreement in the two years allowed for talks.  ""And then we get to the real nigger in the wood pile which is, in two years, what will happen if there is no deal,"" she told a gathering of politicians, lawyers and senior city figures. She said later she apologized unreservedly for any offence caused. ""The comment was entirely unintentional."" May said she had been shocked to hear about the comment, which she described as ""completely unacceptable"". ""I immediately asked the Chief Whip to suspend the party whip,"" May said in a statement. ""Language like this has absolutely no place in politics or in todays society."" Suspending the party whip means Morris is excluded from the party and will sit as an independent, potentially reducing May's ability to pass legislation. Her government already relies on a smaller party after losing its majority at a June election. Morris can still choose to vote in line with the government, and is likely to continue to do so. May did not say how long the suspension would last or if expulsion was possible. Several lawmakers, both from the main opposition parties and from within the Conservatives, had called for Morris to be suspended for her use of the phrase, believed to be rooted in slavery in the United States.  It came to be used to describe something unexpected and wrong but is now generally viewed with disdain as racist.  Additional reporting by Kylie MacLellan; editing by Ralph Boulton"

Standing in front of the 27-year-old Frankfurt native on Thursday evening, were a group of anti-capitalist protesters -- frustrated after their ""Welcome to Hell"" demonstration was interrupted.

Clashes between riot police and demonstrators started shortly after the ""Welcome to Hell"" rally began on Thursday evening.

Police, who had contained the crowd with tear gas, pepper spray, and water cannons, said they were responding to violent protesters, known as the Black Bloc, who had shown up with their faces and heads completely covered.

Reusing said the police would have intervened regardless, using any small incident as a catalyst to shut the protest down.

""If this is all we can do just for showing our opinion and giving a statement -- and if the state forces are just shutting us up... I mean what kind of state do we live in,"" she said.

Hamburg Police said overall 476 officers were injured, at least 186 protesters were arrested and 225 detained over the three days. In total 20,000 police officers were deployed throughout the G20 summit (this includes additional police officers that were requested after Friday night).

Julia Reusing, 27: ""Revolution must not be full of agression. Revolution means love -- not to come together and fight.""

""Welcome to Hell"" was the first of over 30 planned demonstrations in the days before, during and after the G20 Summit. On Saturday, Hamburg Police said 213 officers were injured, at least 114 protesters were arrested and 98 detained over the three days.

When German Chancellor and G20 host Angela Merkel announced her hometown of Hamburg as the summit's location, some feared that the city and its 1.8 million residents would suffer.

The security required to welcome world leaders such as US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Tayyip Recep Erdogan would be disruptive to residents and businesses. But Merkel pressed ahead.

At the same time, demonstrators from across Germany and further afield prepared to exercise their right to assemble.

Up to 12,000 people attended the anti-G20 protest, ""Welcome to Hell.""

Authorities implemented a ""Red-Zone"" an area sectioned off to all but the G20 leaders and their convoys and administrators. At least 15,000 riot police were deployed.

Twenty-five-year-old student Merle M., who declined to give her last name and was protesting over migration rights, told CNN the ""Red Zone"" demonstrated that leaders were ""trying to delete the right to protest.""

The rally called for solidarity amongst anti-capitalist leftist groups.

On Friday morning, a coalition of protest groups organized as ""Block G20 -- Colour the Red Zone"" attempted to break through into the restricted area.

Group organizer and political scientist Alexis Passadakis, 40, told CNN that the aim of the protest was ""disturb the summit.""

Passadakis said the G20 is ""illegitimate with no basis in international law. We don't want a partnership of governance where there's a complete lack of transparency.""

""It's got no effective climate change policy, are blocking migrants saafe routes... and oh, the austerity!"" he said.

Protestors attempting to cross through the ""Red Zone"" barrier are chased by riot police on Friday.

Throughout the day, groups of around 50 people attempted to cross into the ""Red Zone"" -- many staging sit-ins that included singing, chalk-drawing and bubble blowing with other groups drumming and chanting. Local residents handed out coffee to the demonstrators.

Some of the groups who staged sit-in protests were pelted with water cannons before being removed forcibly by police.

On Friday afternoon, scores of people met at the Millerntorplatz where anti-capitalist and anti-fascist groups from Italy and France gathered among German protesters for what briefly felt like a rave.

Singing, chanting and drumming was heard throughout the march.

Eventually, it descended into a chaotic game of cat-and-mouse -- violent protesters hurled stones, bricks and bottles at riot police who responded with sound blasts and tear gas.

Thousands of anti-capitalist groups from across Europe gathered in Hamburg's Millerntorplatz before the rally turned violent.

Caught in the middle of the skirmish was 77-year-old Hamburg resident Karsten Alpers and his bed-bound wife Halgard, who he had brought outside for their daily stroll.

Amidst a crowd of protesters running from riot police, Alberts told CNN that although he wasn't informed where the protests would go, he wasn't worried about the demonstrations and wanted to go about his day as normal.

Karsten Alpers, wife Halgard and her carer Karina Stanczak were caught up in the skirmishes on Friday.

""For Hamburg, the G20 is a wonderful idea but for the real people living here, it's a hard thing -- there's traffic and it's impossible to get around. These people won't damage anything -- they are peaceful. We are not scared,"" he said.

Verena Zech, 47, who was walking her dogs during the ""Colour the Red Zone"" demonstration, said the G20 restrictions in the city had prevented her from getting to work.

15,000 riot police were initially deployed for the summit but on Friday, Hamburg Police called for an extra 1,000 to provide additional support.

Although her routine was disrupted, Zech said she didn't mind the demonstrations themselves, but called on the German government to give more information about the cost of hosting the summit.

The insurance worker added that her neighbors had experienced ""angst"" over violent clashes that were broadcast on television from Thursday night's protests and from Friday morning, where masked protesters had set cars on fire in an upscale neighborhood in western Hamburg.

Police used water cannons to disperse a crowd of protestors in central Hamburg on Thursday.

As dusk fell Friday, activists returned to the Reeperbahn, where protesters from the LGBTI+ community, anarchists and other members of the left enjoyed three separate music events.

Some moved barefoot through the square -- cutting through a wafting pungent smell of cannabis and cigarette smoke as Lou Reed's ""Perfect Day"" blared from a loudspeaker.

Further down the street, anarchists and members of splinter left groups bounced heads to a socialist-styled hip-hop performance.

Later, a van that had been driven from southern Germany spun electronic music from its roof; a sizeable chunk of the crowd swaying their bodies as blinking lights from water cannon trucks flashed directly in front of them.

Electronic music was the soundtrack to a late night dance party at Reeperbahn, where activists created a human peace sign in front of water cannons parked in front of the rally.

But a mile away in the Sternschanze district, riots broke out for a second night in a row.

From dusk until dawn Saturday, a group of anarchists and radical left-wing protesters set alight scaffolding, building supplies and trash cans across a four-block radius.

Anarchists started fires in the Sternschanze district on Friday.

Police responded with tear gas and water cannons as demonstrators continued to fuel multiple fires across the area with whatever scraps they could find.

As the riots grew, retail shops were looted and a supermarket was burned out.

At one point, anarchists poured stolen champagne onto a crackling fire as other demonstrators stood topless, waving their water soaked t-shirts dry over the heat.

Multiple shops were looted and destroyed.

While fires raged, leaving parts of the Sternschanze looking like a war zone, a few streets away party goers drank beer and cycled through empty streets freed of traffic.

As the G20 summit drew to a close on Saturday, an eclectic mix of up to 50,000 activists, according to police, moved through the city's sun-filled streets, shaking off Friday night's hangover with each step.

Two separate groups marched parallel to one another during the day, with a markedly different dynamic in comparison to the previous day's rallies.

The marches saw LGBTI+ groups, Marxist collectives, migration lawyers, Chinese human rights activists, Kurdish independence movements, feminist organizations and environmental activists walking peacefully alongside one another with riot police leading the way.

Kurds advocating for an independent state demonstrated at one of the rallies on Saturday.

Couples with sunflower crowns held hands and barefooted activists picnicked on the pavement.

Some families traveled into the city center on tandem bikes to listen to anti-G20 speeches at a stage by the harborside Fischmarkt -- where the first skirmishes had kicked off just days before.

Carolin Wolter, a 25-year-old office worker, arrived to the harbor with young daughter Levke as Nina Simone's anthem ""Sinnerman"" played between talks on climate change.

22,000 protestors, including many environmental activists marched through central Hamburg on Saturday. A separate demonstration also moved through the city at the same time.

Wolter said she's worried about the decisions that G20 leaders such as Trump are making about the environment, claiming their profit before people policies will inevitably lead to a bleak future.

""(The environment is) the first main important issue to speak about, especially for my daughter, whose future lies in the decision of these leaders,"" Wolter said. ""And that worries me.""

As the US President and other leaders left the summit on Saturday, police officers took off their helmets and let out a long exhale, telling CNN the atmosphere had finally relaxed.

For the protesters, concerned that they'd seen little at the G20 to assuage their concerns, their campaigns continue."
http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/five-guys-take-same-photo-for-35-years/index.html,FIVE GUYS TAKE SAME PHOTO FOR 35 YEARS,"Paul Vercammen, CNN Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Updated 7th July 2017

(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Five friends from Santa Barbara High School have been snapping the same photo in the same pose on the same cabin bench every five years for the past 35 years.

From left to right, as is the tradition, John ""Wedge"" Wardlaw, Mark Rumer-Cleary, Dallas Burney, John Molony and John Dickson gazed at the camera on June 24 in the remote serenity of Copco Lake on the California-Oregon border to capture their eighth entry into the photo collection that took the Internet by storm five years ago.

""It blows my mind 35 years later we're recreating that 1982 photo,"" said Dickson.

Wardlaw, who snapped the photo, believes it's one of their best. ""I used a Nikon D800 and video and think we came the closest we ever have to the original photo,"" he said.

In the years that have passed since their last shot in 2012, the five have checked some empty boxes in their personal columns.

Three of the five, Rumer-Cleary, Burney and Dickson, got married, and there's finally a child descending from the quintet.

""It's been great. I wanted to become a father for a long time,"" said Dickson, who entered parenthood at 51 after getting married for the first time at 49.

Dickson, now 54, and his wife, Sharon, celebrated the birth of son Jimmy two years ago. Someday Jimmy may play a role in the longstanding photo tradition, but we're getting a little ahead of this fishing tale.

Viral sensation

Five friends have been snapping the same photo in the same pose on the same cabin bench every five years for the past 35 years.

The Copco Lake five went from laid-back dudes sitting on a deck to Internet stars five years ago when CNN's story on the friends went viral, turning them into a global sensation.

""It was totally unexpected and we were in shock, because our photos went everywhere,"" Dickson said. ""I had a friend in Sweden let me know we were on the front page of his newspaper.""

""We got a lot of emails from people who wrote they couldn't believe we stayed friends that long,"" he said.

They appeared on morning network television shows and were interviewed by TV, print and radio stations from all around the world, all because their photo reunions seem to have struck a chord.

At the lake, the friends stay in a prefabricated Lindal Cedar Home built in 1970 by John Laux, Wardlaw's grandfather. They call it the cabin; the three bedrooms, loft and basement a throwback to the boys who go way back.

Early ties

The five friends have been gathering at the same Copco Lake cabin for more than three decades.

Wardlaw, 54, and Dickson formed a friendship in middle school, out of tragedy.

As the Wardlaw family attended ""Star Wars"" in downtown Santa Barbara, California, on July 26, 1977, the Sycamore Fire exploded in the foothills when a kite became entangled in power lines. The ferocious blaze burned down 250 homes, including Wardlaw's house.

""We rented a house from the Dickson family, right next door to them,"" Wardlaw said. ""John and I became friends.""

The neighbor boys became obsessed with making Super 8 movies, with all manner of testosterone on film: combat war sagas, some science fiction mixed in, a ninja tale or two.

""We had a mutual interest,"" recalled Dickson. ""We made dozens of these Super 8 movies including some later at Copco Lake. All five of us friends have been in them at some point.""

The two became friends with the others in high school. The Super 8 movies ""kept us out of teenage trouble,"" said Burney, 54. ""Even though many of us moved on to college, or the US Air Force in my case, we always continued to find time to do the movies.""

Rumer-Cleary, 53, said the friends have remained tight despite a few spats here and there.

""Other than two guys being irritated with each other for three months a little after high school, it was nothing lasting,"" Rumer-Cleary said.

Where they are now

Wardlaw is still a filmmaker and photographer. He lives in Bend, Oregon.

Rumer-Cleary is a hardware and systems engineer who founded Occam Networks and now lives in Portland, Oregon.

Burney is a third-grade teacher living in Antioch, California.

Molony, 54, is a New Orleans-based photographer

Only Dickson remains in Santa Barbara, where he runs tourism website santabarbara.com

Their photo streak started in 1982 when the friends, who were about 19, headed to the cabin that Wardlaw's grandpa built and took their first photo.

Among the rules that developed out of that first photo: Molony holds a glass in his right hand and Rumer must have a hat in his lap. Despite lurching into their 50s, when bellies can bulge, the men decided to take this year's photo shirtless for the first time in 30 years.

Many of them have been working out to avoid being fat shamed, but not Rumer-Cleary.

""Oh God no, that is much too indulgent on an ego level for me,"" he said with a laugh.

But no doubt the new photo will be analyzed, and last time some of the dissection felt like anti-social media.

""I couldn't believe the amount of reactions (in 2012) to our picture,"" Molony said. ""About 75% of the responses were glowing and loving, but some of it was visceral hate.""

Traditions past and future

Just like the first trip, they still crank up the stereo and listen to heavy doses of Rush and Pink Floyd.

""During that first trip I don't think any of us drank alcohol the whole time, except one thing,"" Wardlaw remembered.

""My grandpa liked bourbon and after he died in 1976 there was and still is an Ezra Brooks 1969 Arkansas Razorback decanter that still had a little whiskey left. Some of us passed it around and took some sips.""

In honor of Grandpa, 14 Razorback decanters now decorate the cabin. Like the decanter, grandpa passed along a love of the lake and the cabin."
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-weekahead-idUSKBN19S2MC,TECH'S MARKET LEADERSHIP OVER? NOT SO FAST,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Technology shares surrendered their leadership in the U.S. stock market over the past month, but the fast-growing group may soon resume its outperformance and maneuver back into pole position. Upcoming earnings reports for the technology sector .SPLRCT, whose profits are expected to outpace the overall S&P 500 .SPX for the 11th consecutive quarter, could lure back investors who have been concerned about expensive valuations and that too many people may have piled into the big names. The sector has slumped 4 percent since the first week of June, while financials .SPSY have climbed more than 5 percent and healthcare .SPXHC has gained 3 percent. This has prompted speculation that investors may have been cashing out their tech profits to move into those groups. ""Technology has taken a rest, but its going to heat up again, and I see tech returning to favor the second half of the year,"" said portfolio manager J. Bryant Evans of Cozad Asset Management in Champaign, Illinois. For the first five months of 2017, tech was the talk of the stock market, far outperforming the other 10 major S&P 500 sectors and sparking the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC to its strongest first half since 2009. ""I think of (tech's recent swoon) as profit-taking rather than driven by change in the fundamental factors,"" said John Praveen, managing director of Prudential International Investments Advisers in Newark, New Jersey. ""The fundamentals are still positive for the sector."" On Friday, the tech sector ended a volatile week by rising 1.3 percent, topping all other sectors and a 0.6 percent rise for the S&P 500. Analysts estimate tech's second-quarter earnings rose 11.2 percent, with semiconductor companies accounting for much of the gain, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The increase tops the estimated 7.9 percent rise for the overall S&P 500 and is well above every sector except for energy .SPNY, whose performance will be skewed because of negative year-earlier results. ""The tech sector has the highest growth expectations and only moderate uncertainty,"" Morgan Stanley equity strategists said in a research note. Given tech's outsized position - 22 percent of the market value of the S&P 500 - the sector's growth is critical to overall U.S. corporate profit gains.  For the second quarter, tech profit growth alone is expected to account for nearly 28 percent of the S&P 500's overall increase in earnings, or nearly half if energy were excluded. ""In an economy that still seems to have some growing pains, consistent growth is worth paying up for, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. Tech's second-quarter revenue growth is projected at 7.2 percent, faster than 4.6 percent for S&P 500 companies overall, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. There is ""growth on the top line, which is more important at this point in the cycle, than in the bottom line only,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. This earnings season, she will focus on companies' comments about sales activity. Valuations for the sector also may not be so expensive. Tech is trading at 18.1 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, just above 17.8 times for the overall market. That difference is even smaller when compared with the premium tech has held over the past 15 years, following the dot-com bubble. Over that time, its average P/E has been 17.2 times versus 14.7 times for the S&P 500. Another factor in tech's favor: The dollar's .DXY 6.1 percent decline this year against a basket of major currencies. S&P 500 tech companies generate 60 percent of revenue from outside the United States, compared with 40 percent for companies in the entire index. A stronger dollar makes foreign sales less valuable when they are translated back into the U.S. currency for reporting purposes. Despite these positive factors, other sectors may end up besting tech. Healthcare's year-to-date performance has nearly kept pace, and a resolution of the legislation moving through Congress could draw investors who have been wary about political uncertainty hovering over the sector. A pickup in the economy and inflation could favor groups like industrials .SPLRCI, energy and financials, which tend to perform better in such times. Clues will come starting on July 14, when a big batch of bank reports kicks off the heart of the earnings season. In tech, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) report the following week, while Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O) are among the companies that will follow later in the month.

The NYT reports that an email said she would provide information from the Russian government

Washington (CNN) An email sent to Donald Trump Jr. last year stated that a Russian lawyer had ""compromising"" information about Hillary Clinton as ""part of a Russian government effort"" to help the Trump campaign, The New York Times reported Monday.

Citing three people with knowledge of the email, the Times reported that Rob Goldstone, who connected Trump Jr. with the Russian lawyer, sent the email to Trump Jr. pointing to the Russian government as a source of potential information that could damage Clinton.

The story that Trump Jr. was offered potential information from the Russian government to aide his father's campaign came after months of staunch denials from President Donald Trump that his campaign had a connection to Russia.

Alan Futerfas, a lawyer for Trump Jr., said in a statement following the story that it was ""much ado about nothing."" The statement called the period of May to early June 2016 ""an intensely busy time"" for Trump Jr. The statement said Goldstone had emailed Trump's son about alleged wrongdoing from Clinton regarding Russia.

""The meeting lasted about 20-30 minutes, and nothing came of it,"" Futerfas said. ""His father knew nothing about it. The bottom line is that Don, Jr. did nothing wrong. I have been representing people in investigatory matters for almost 30 years, and I see nothing here.""

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-09/australia-s-joyce-says-he-isn-t-against-taking-coal-plant-stake,Missing,"Australias Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce indicated he supports the government being an equity partner in any new coal-fired power station, and said that lenders are willing to finance fossil fuel-based electricity generation.I have got nothing against taking equity in it, Joyce told Sky News Sunday Agenda program, adding that an equity stake would be preferable to lending money to enable such a facility to be built. Why? Because an equity position on a reasonable asset is an asset for the Australian balance sheet.Barnaby JoycePrime Minister Malcolm Turnbulls government is under pressure to curb carbon emissions by electricity generators without driving up power costs. Residential power disconnections have risen as much as 140 percent in six years amid a doubling in average household energy costs, the Weekend Australian newspaper reported Saturday. Australia exported more coal than any other country in 2015, and has the fourth-largest share of the planets coal resources, the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science said in December.Not having any coal-fired power generation in Australia is an absurdity, Joyce told Sky. We have a massive coal resource. We should be developing the capacity to do it as efficiently and as effectively as possible, and also possibly selling that technology to the world as well.The cost of building a high-efficiency low-emission black coal plant, known as clean coal, is estimated at A$2.2 billion ($1.7 billion) for 1,000 megawatts of capacity, a report commissioned for the Minerals Council of Australia and the Coal21 Fund said this month.Still, Australias four biggest banks have come under increasing pressure from green groups to review their lending to fossil fuel projects.Westpac Banking Corp., Australias second-biggest bank, said in April it imposed tighter rules for financing new thermal coal mines in a move that would bar it from lending to Adani Groups $16.5 billion Carmichael mine in Queensland state, the nations largest coal project.Joyce refuted the idea that lenders are unwilling to finance new coal-fired electricity projects, saying they will commit if they are given assurance that the government wont be against the fossil fuel in three years.If we can create certainty, we can bed this thing down, Joyce said. Well have people willing to invest in that section to give us highly efficient delivery of power.Coal provides a more reliable source of base-line power, Joyce said, compared with alternatives such as wind, which require storage systems.Elon Musks Tesla Inc. won a tender to build what the billionaire says is the worlds largest lithium-ion battery system in rural South Australia to support the states blackout-plagued power grid. Tesla will provide 100 megawatts of battery storage by Dec. 1, pairing it with a wind farm at Hornsdale north of Adelaide operated by Frances Neoen, South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill said in a statement on Friday.South Australia of course has suffered from the very ideological approach to power where they allowed a lot of wind power to be built without taking into account that the wind doesnt blow all the time and backing it up, Turnbull told reporters Saturday at the Group of Eight meeting in Hamburg, where world leaders collectively advanced talks to fight climate change without U.S. backing.Australias national energy policy is guided by engineering and economics, not by ideology and politics, the Australian Prime Minister said.Fossil fuels are going to be part of the energy mix of the world for a very long time -- nobody disputes that, he said. The object of climate policy is to reduce net emissions; its not to eliminate the burning of all fossil fuels."

He added that this is the first public evidence of senior officials having met with Russians to try to discredit Clinton

Washington (CNN) The vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said Monday that Donald Trump Jr.'s acknowledgment of a meeting with a Russian lawyer last June is the first clear public evidence that senior Trump campaign officials met with Russians to try to discredit Hillary Clinton.

""This is the first time that the public has seen clear evidence of senior level members of the Trump campaign meeting Russians to try to obtain information that might hurt the campaign of Hillary Clinton,"" Sen. Mark Warner told reporters.

Trump Jr. acknowledged Sunday that he met with a Russian lawyer who he had been told ""might have information helpful to the campaign."" The President's oldest son issued his statement in response to The New York Times's reporting that he ""was promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton"" before agreeing to meet with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.

Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort also attended the meeting with Veselnitskaya, according to Trump Jr., but he said he told them ""nothing of the substance"" prior to the meeting. Trump Jr. said it quickly became clear during the meeting that Veselnitskaya had no information he deemed meaningful and that Veselnitskaya primarily wanted to secure the meeting to talk about a law pertaining to adoptions.

But Warner said Monday that Trump Jr.'s acknowledgment of the meeting reveals a ""continuing pattern"" of Trump campaign and administration officials having ""conveniently forgotten"" meetings they had with Russians.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/09/opinions/fake-vs-real-trump-opinion-obeidallah/index.html,DON'T FALL FOR THE 'FAKE TRUMP',"Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio's daily program ""The Dean Obeidallah Show"" and a columnist for The Daily Beast. Follow him @deanofcomedy . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

(CNN) There are two Donald Trumps: the ""real"" one and the ""fake"" one. We saw both on display during the President's Europe trip this past week.

The fake Trump is the one who shows glimmers of being thoughtful, informed and presidential. We saw that Trump during his speech in Poland this week, when the Wall Street Journal editorial board, which has slammed Trump in the past, referred to his remarks as "" Trump's defining speech ."" Trump apparently loved the editorial so much it's now on the White House website

Sure, that speech was ""presidential,"" with sentences like : ""The triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship gives us all hope for a future in which good conquers evil, and peace achieves victory over war."" But let's be blunt: Those words scream fake Trump.

The real Trump -- the one many of us knew on ""The Apprentice"" and were reintroduced to when he declared his bid for the presidency in 2015 -- was on display that same day at a press conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda. When a reporter asked Trump if he would finally acknowledge that Russia was behind the meddling in our 2016 election, he did not offer measured words wrapped in beautiful prose.

Instead, we got the real Trump telling us , ""I think it very well could be Russia, but I think it could very well have been other countries. I think a lot of people interfere...Nobody really knows. Nobody really knows for sure.""

But former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper responded , ""We saw no evidence whatsoever that it was anyone involved in this other than the Russians.""

And on Sunday's ""State of the Union,"" after CNN's Dana Bash played the clip of Trump saying ""Nobody really knows,"" US Ambassador Nikki Haley still said , ""Everybody knows that Russia meddled in our elections.""

Then, in true Trump style, the President added : ""I remember when I was sitting back listening about Iraq, weapons of mass destruction, how everybody was 100% certain that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. Guess what? That led to one big mess. They were wrong, and it led to a mess.""

And while Trump was indeed correct on Iraq, many intelligence officials refute his claim that they are wrong about Russia's meddling.

But there again was the real Trump, this time mocking our intelligence agencies on foreign soil because he refuses to accept their conclusions on Russia's involvement in the US electoral process. Imagine Republican outrage if President Barack Obama had gone to Europe and publicly questioned the work of numerous US intelligence agencies.

Poland wasn't the only place Trump presented two opposing versions of himself. At the close of the G20 gathering in Hamburg, Germany, Trump tweeted : ""The #G20Summit was a wonderful success and carried out beautifully by Chancellor Angela Merkel. Thank you!""

That was a thoughtful, gracious tweet which represented the United States well.

Unfortunately for America, that was also the fake Trump.

The real Trump could be seen the day before, tweeting a bizarre attack on Hillary Clinton's former campaign manager: ""Everyone here is talking about why John Podesta refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the CIA. Disgraceful!""

If Trump is telling the truth, the leaders of the G20 countries weren't focused on the economic and security issues of their respective countries, but instead were fixated on the hacking of the Democratic National Committee in July 2016. (If you believe that, please contact me because I have a unicorn ranch I'm looking to sell.)

Then there was the fake Trump who appeared ""presidential"" during the G20 summit photo of world leaders by not pushing his way past other world leaders to be in the center of the photo, as he did in a past photo op.

But the real Trump emerged Saturday, when he suddenly left in the middle of a G20 working meeting tilted, ""Partnership with Africa, migration and health.""

Who did the President leave at the table in his absence, sandwiched between British Prime Minister Theresa May and Chinese President Xi Jinping? His daughter Ivanka

Typically when world leaders leave these meetings, a high-ranking government official will sit in who is knowledgeable on the subject matter up for discussion. It's unclear what Ivanka's expertise on African migration and health issues is.

The difference between the real and fake Trump is as clear as Trump vodka, assuming you can still find a bottle. If you see Trump being ""presidential,"" you know you're watching the fake one. Just give it a little time and the real Trump -- the one who denies inconvenient facts, attacks the appearance of a female cable news host and mocks our intelligence agencies -- will soon reappear.

Don't be fooled by Trump's ""presidential"" moments. They truly are the definition of fake news."

The pair founded tequila business Casamigos together (which was recently sold in a billion-dollar deal) and share neighboring holiday homes in Mexico. In the past theyve toured their Harley-Davidsons across America, cruised the Dolomite mountain range in Italy, and explored Corsica.Gerber, who is married to former supermodel Cindy Crawford and runs a bar and restaurant empire, explained: Sometimes we ride for 15 hours a day. We never know where we are goingwe just get up in the morning and hit the road.""A post shared by Rande Gerber (@randegerber) on Sep 2, 2016 at 8:48am PDTOur aim is to find the road less traveled. George is pretty old-school, so we just pack a map and dont switch on the satellite navigation. With a helmet on, people have no idea who we are.Despite the patter of multiple feet, Gerber says the arrival of twins wont prevent his friend from getting on a bike again. Its cast in stone. Weve discussed him being a dad, and nothing stops the ride.Top of the pairs tour list this summer is Spain. Gerber and Clooney have been poring over maps to find the best routes. We thought we should check out Andalusia because of the mountain roads and passes. The day usually ends in a bar, drinking with the locals.To help the celebrity duo find their way, I packed off to Spain with my friend Ian Smithwho happily played George Clooney to my Rande Gerber. Im not a Hollywood A-lister, and hes in IT, but we do know how to ride a motorcycle.Clooney and Co. have enough money to fly their bikes anywhere on the planetbut what about the rest of us?  Harley-Davidsons Authorized Tours allow riders to rent bikes at more than 200 of their showrooms around the world.Bikers can choose from the companys latest range of machines, some equipped with Bluetooth audio for the long road ahead. The most expensive models even have satellite navigation, far easier to read on the road than Georges map.The process is almost the same as hiring a car, although riders need the appropriate motorcycle license. (Health insurance might be advisable, considering the state of some Spanish roads.)Clooney and Gerber are set to start their summer break in Málaga, home of the Picasso Museum, where Harley-Davidson runs a flagship store.  When I get there, assistant Jose Maria had our bikes ready to go. We opted for a Heritage Softail Classic and a Road Kingretro models designed for cool touring.Each has two leather panniers, and theres room on the empty pillion seat to strap on a further bag. Once we established that Cindy Crawford isnt coming, I load up, and we head off into Spanish rush-hour traffic.Despite their plans for a freestyle adventure, the Clooney gang know theyll be heading north from Málaga. That will take them away from the busy A7 coastal highway that used to be called the Road to Hell because the traffic was so dangerous.The A7000 northeast of Málaga to Colmenar is biker heaven. A series of sweeping corners that cuts across the center of the Málaga Mountains National Park, the road is punctuated by countless viewpoints and jaw-dropping vistas of the Mediterranean. There are no major towns here, just breathtaking scenery, the smell of gorse and wild poppies, and the occasional horse and cart to slow your progress.For a low-key stay, Clooney will likely head for the hills and a hotel such as La Bobadilla (from $170 a night)about halfway to Granada. Its the kind of retreat where a publicity-shy superstar can really get away from it all. Palm trees, spa treatments, and roomy suits with a private terraces to unwind and consider the next film script.La Bobadilla is tucked away in more than 1,000-acres of olive groves, near Loja. The sense of arrival when you finally pull up on the cobbled square outside is palpableonly the grumbling of our engines disturbs the peace.The Oceans 11 star can make a day trip east from here to visit the Alhambra, the iconic Moorish palace named a Unesco World Heritage Site in the heart of the ancient city of Granada. He will have to dodge the obstacle course of cafés and souvenir shops en routeplus the throng of 6,600 people who pass through the hilltop spectacular every day.The next day, my road partner and I rose early to avoid the heat and set off due west, toward La Roda de Andalusia. The roads here are faster as we cross the southern plains, passing no-nonsense towns and the occasional vineyard.Were heading for the Andalusian bullfighting capital of Ronda in Málaga, which will be a must-see for Clooney. Sitting above a deep ravine and surrounded by lush river valleys, its one of the most remarkable cities in the whole of Spain. The narrow cobbled streets arent well-suited to a heavyweight Harley, however, so we park just outside of town.Hotel La Fuente (from $193 a night) is small but tastefully furnished on a quiet hillside. The walls are loaded with artwork, and theres a palm tree that throws welcome shade over the swimming pool. Our roof-top room boasts an enormous outdoor bath tub that, in different circumstances, would wow any leading lady.Using Ronda as a base, Clooney has a wealth of mountain roads to explore, stretching in either direction through the Grazalema and Las Nieves national parks. The orange-soaked streets of Seville are a 90-minute ride north, with a magnificent cathedral and an old-town area that feels as though it's a medieval film set.The star can indulge in his passion for liquor-making with a visit to the sherry capital of Jerez. The city is more than 3,000 years old. A few miles southeast are the Straits of Gibraltar, the perfect spot for dolphin and whale-watching.Superstars are few and far between in this remote corner of Spain, but head 70 miles south from Ronda to the coast, and you never know who you will see. Pulling up at newly refurbished Amàre Marbella (from $257 a night) on a Harley is always going to turn heads, even if you arent George Clooney.With our bikes safely stored in the underground car park, my B-list friend and I avoided the well-tanned hordes on the promenade below by relaxing on the hotels roof-top terrace. The views out to sea are magnificent, but this is definitely a place to be seen in your best pair of espadrilles.A post shared by Amàre Marbella Beach Hotel (@amaremarbella) on Jun 17, 2017 at 12:02pm PDTMarbellas remarkable Old Quarter is a rash of narrow cobbled streets, with lively cafés and bars.

His electric car company, Tesla (TSLA), has teamed up with a French renewable energy firm and an Australian state government to install the world's largest lithium ion battery.

Paired up with a wind farm in the state of South Australia, the battery will be three times more powerful than the next biggest in the world, Musk said at a news conference in the city of Adelaide on Friday.

""If South Australia's willing to take a big risk, then so are we,"" he said.

This will be the highest power battery system in the world by a factor of 3. Australia rocks!! https://t.co/c1DD7xtC90 Ã¢ÂÂ Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 7, 2017

The announcement comes after billionaire entrepreneur Mike Cannon-Brookes threw down the gauntlet to Musk in March, asking if Tesla was serious when it claimed it could quickly end blackouts in South Australia.

""Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?"" Musk wrote on Twitter at the time.

Related: Musk offers to fix Australia's energy crisis in 100 days

South Australia's population of 1.7 million people suffer regular power cuts and energy shortages. In September, much of the state was left without power after a storm damaged crucial transmission lines. Another major blackout happened in February after an unexpected spike in demand due to a heat wave.

Jay Weatherill, the premier of South Australia, said the large-scale battery system Musk is promising will ""provide stabilization services to the grid.""

Related: Big Oil needs to spend $350 billion ... on wind and solar

Funding to build the battery will come from the South Australian government's plan -- worth 550 million Australian dollars ($417 million) -- to deliver affordable and clean power. It will be linked up to French renewable energy company Neoen's Hornsdale Wind Farm near Jamestown, South Australia.

But if Musk and Tesla run into delays, it won't cost the state's taxpayers anything.

""We need to get it done, we need to make sure it's working properly, and we want to do it well under 100 days,"" Musk said."

The discovery yields the oldest known collection of Madeira in the United States

(CNN) Museum workers in New Jersey broke through a Prohibition-era wall and a locked wooden cage to discover over 50 bottles and 42 demijohns of rare Madeira wine dating back as early as 1769.

Liberty Hall Museum at Kean University in Union, New Jersey, says the discovery yields the oldest known collection of Madeira in the United States.

""We had no idea the old bottles were there,"" said John Kean, first cousin to New Jersey's former governor and president of the museum. ""We knew there would be wine, but had no idea as to the date. That was a major surprise.""

Historians and museum workers have been renovating Liberty Hall Museum, originally just called Liberty Hall, which was home to New Jersey's first elected governor and signer of the Constitution, William Livingston.

The house was built in 1772, just prior to the American Revolution, and originally had 14 rooms. The estate changed ownership in 1811 to the Kean family and eventually became the 50-house mansion that stands today.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-south-idUSKBN19V1SQ?il=0,"SYRIAN ARMY, MILITIAS ATTACK REBELS IN SOUTHEAST DESERT","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian troops and Iranian-backed militias launched an assault on Bedouin villages in southeast Syria on Monday to consolidate control of a swathe of desert stretching to the Iraqi border, Western-backed rebels said. The rebels said they came under attack at dawn in a sparsely populated desert area that lies east of the pro-government controlled city of Sweida, mainly inhabited by the Druze minority. The air and ground offensive, backed by Russian air power, was waged on eight villages from Tal Asfar to Tlul al Shuhaib that had been seized at the end of March by Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels from Islamic State after the hardline militants had retreated to regroup further north. ""This is the biggest attack by the regime and on the villages of eastern Sweida. They have used all types of weapons from aerial bombing to artillery and an unprecedented ground offensive,"" said Mohammad Adnan, spokesman of Jaish Ahrar al Ashaer, a rebel group composed of tribal fighters operating in the border area with Jordan. ""In the years when Daesh controlled these area, the army never clashed with them,"" Adnan added. Adnan later said the army was able to seize at least seven villages. An army statement said they had recaptured several towns, villages and strategic hilltops in the eastern Sweida countryside. The rugged area east of Sweida is mainly inhabited by Bedouin tribes who have long defied government authority. Many of them make up the main rebel groups based in the area.   The area is not part of the U.S.-Russian brokered ceasefire for southwest Syria that came into effect on Sunday in the first peace-making effort of the war by the U.S. government under President Donald Trump.  In the southwest, where the ceasefire was generally holding, rebels said the army had stopped aerial bombardments but intermittent shelling continued on rebel-held areas in Deraa city and in the Syrian Golan Heights. ""We are monitoring violations by the regime in several areas using mortars and heavy artillery,"" said Major Issam al Rayes, spokesman for the Southern Front coalition of Western-backed rebel groups. The Syrian army backed by Iranian-backed militias have since June stepped up their bombardment of rebel-held areas in the border city of Deraa in a bid to reach the Jordanian border.  It has also been sending reinforcements further toward the southeastern desert to prevent areas left by Islamic State from falling into the hands of the FSA. ""The Iranian Shi'ite militias are continuing to pour reinforcements into the Badia to expand their area of control. We are doing what we can to repel them,"" said Saed Saif, an official from the FSA's Ahmed Abdo Martyrs Brigade. The advances in areas that had been in Islamic State hands  has brought them within reach of the Iraqi frontier for the first time in years. They have also effectively encircled FSA-controlled desert territory stretching to the Jordanian and Iraqi borders and close to the Tanf garrison in Syria where U.S. forces are based.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-oculus-idUSKBN19V0JJ,"FACEBOOK'S OCULUS CUTS PRICE OF VIRTUAL REALITY SET, MATCHING RIVAL","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oculus, the virtual reality company owned by Facebook Inc, is temporarily cutting the price of its hardware, as the industry tries to figure out why the technology for immersive games and stories has not taken off among consumers.  Oculus is cutting the combined price of its Rift headset and Touch controllers to $399 for six weeks beginning on Monday, said Jason Rubin, Oculus vice president for content. That matches the price of another virtual reality set, PlayStation VR, made by Sony Corp.  Vive, a virtual reality set developed by HTC Corp, is listed for sale at $799 on its website, and it has not recently cut the price.  Facebook paid $3 billion to acquire Oculus and retain its employees in 2014.  Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said at the time that the medium, which offers a 360-degree panoramic view through headsets, would ""become a part of daily life for billions of people.""  That has not happened, although it is unclear if that is because of high prices, something inherent in the technology or some other reason.  Pricing discounts are sometimes a sign of weak product sales. Rubin, though, said in an interview that was not the case with Oculus, which he said could have cut the price sooner but wanted to wait until there were enough games, movies and other entertainment to keep a broad audience busy.  The pace of game releases has quickened, making a wider appeal possible, Rubin said: ""We're now in a space where the mass market can be much happier.""  Oculus cut its price once before this year, dropping it from $798 to $598 in March.  In May, Oculus shut the doors of its Story Studio, two years after it launched at the Sundance Film Festival, to focus on external content makers.  Another setback was a $500 million legal judgment against Oculus in February, when a jury found in favor of video game publisher ZeniMax Media Inc in a lawsuit accusing Facebook and Oculus of copyright infringement.

http://cnn.com/travel/article/ciociaria-italy-luxury-stays/index.html,"CIOCIARIA, ITALY: SECRET REGION OFFERS LUXURY STAYS - CNN.COM","Silvia Marchetti, for CNN Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Updated 7th July 2017

(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ ""You see all this? It now belongs to my family after decades of hard labor and sweat. We've redeemed it,"" says Lorenzo Pacitti as he points to the hills surrounding his estate.

Pacitti is a rosy-cheeked shepherd, but not an ordinary one. He's a billionaire, like all his colleagues who inhabit Comino Valley in Ciociaria, a virtually unknown misty patch of fluorescent green land stuck in central wild mountains of Italy

Its name comes from cioce, the hairy sheep-leather shoes worn by herdsmen in the past. Ciociaria isn't officially on a map, and is a secret even to most Italians.

This is where skeletons of our early ancestors were found in deep caves, where the fiery Samnite tribes fought against the bloodthirsty Romans, and where the Gustav Line ran during World War II.

For centuries, it was a no-man's kingdom at the boundaries of the rich papal state -- a poor and outcast region roamed by bandits, saints and pilgrims. But today it's enjoying a renaissance thanks to farmers, breeders and shepherds who've made a fortune with pigs, cured meats and mouthwatering cheeses.

They've opened rural resorts and gourmet restaurants. Their lavish villas dot the landscape amid medieval sanctuaries, healing fountains and pilgrimage sites rising from the ashes of pagan temples.

Sheep, goats and cows still cross the streets. Shepherds stop to say hello. But they've evolved, too. They don't wear cioce anymore or go around snatching abandoned properties with large bundles of cash stuffed in their pockets.

Victorian cheese bistrot

Ciociaria owes its name to the traditional shoes known as ""cioce"" worn by ancient shepherds.

Pacitti, who drives a sleek, green Kawasaki motorbike, is the owner of a pinkish Victorian-style villa called Casa Lawrence, where English writer D. H. Lawrence sojourned in 1919 to write his novel ""The Lost Girl.""

Part of the mansion has been turned into a rustic cheesery, dubbed Caciosteria. There's also a B&B featuring vintage furniture, Lawrence's bed, chamberpot, bathtub, clothes, pajamas and writing table. There's an eerie ambiance at the reading corner where the author loved to sit and meditate, taking in the bucolic view.

""The property passed into my ancestors' hands because the owner, Lawrence's British host, had no more heirs or couldn't reach them. When he died my grandparents were already working on the land so it was easy for them to grab it,"" Pacitti explains.

Pacitti makes one of the best sheep pecorino cheeses in Italy. It's salty, crumbly and hard to bite with a thick outer skin. Best served with home-made fig and mulberry jam, the more seasoned it is, the tastier.

""It needs to stink of sheep,"" adds Pacitti, who also owns the valley's most prestigious dairy farm.

Another of his delicacies is Il Blu, which is a refined, pricey gorgonzola on the verge of having maggots in it, which sells at 45 euros per kilo (about $50).

At the Caciosteria, guests eat outside on wooden benches, surrounded by bull skulls hung on wooden doors to guard against ill omens. A final shot of ratafia liqueur with black cherries is the best digestif after a cheese-rich meal.

Foal carpaccio

Ciociaria is home to high-quality pecorino, pig lard and blue cheese.

Ciociaria is also home to a plethora of meat dishes.

In the nearby town of Picinisco, where Italy's most dreaded bandit, Domenico Fuoco -- akin to Robin Hood -- once used his guns to persuade rich men to give their fortunes over to the poor, young cattle breeder Davide Gargaro has opened gourmet hostaria La Taverna di Arturo.

A strong stomach might be required, though it's all a matter of overcoming stereotypes.

Extravagant dishes include baby horse carpaccio, horse salami, black pig lard (the many layers of fat make it tastier), pig cheek and neck salami, and dried sheep and goat meat sausages, known as ""misischia,"" which are traditionally stored underneath a horse's saddle.

""The animal sweat keeps them warm, ready to eat,"" says Davide, who loves his animals so much he leaves them to freely roam the hilltops and prefers to have someone else butcher them. ""They're my babies. How could I kill a six-month-old foal? I could never watch them die, but people who refuse to eat horse meat just because it's a horse commit animal discrimination.""

The meat courses are paired with a fine red bottle of Caronte, named after another legendary village outlaw who loved to rob wine barriques from greedy merchants. The nickname also refers to Dante's fiery old boatman Charon who transported sinners' souls in the inferno of ""The Divine Comedy.""

'Faith is a mini-skirt'

""Faith here is worn like a mini-skirt,"" says Picinisco priest Antonello Dionigi.

Picinisco is at the crossroad of the so-called ""triangle of faith"" where folklore mingles with legends of miracles and holy apparitions of the Virgin Mary.

""Faith here is worn like a mini-skirt,"" says the village priest Antonello Dionigi. ""It must be tight at the center, short on the loose ends and holds the mystery of life right in the middle"".

And there are ghosts too. The town's patron saint Lorenzo was said to have saved the city from Saracen invaders by creating a phantom army that chased the pirates away.

Rumor has it a group of Roman soldiers, dressed in armor and holding weapons, can be heard at night singing and partying beneath the ruins of a collapsed fortress.

The valley's revival is also courtesy of immigrant families, who fled to Scotland and the New World in search of a better life and whose heirs have now returned to their native hometowns. And with big money to invest.

They have restyled old villages like Casalattico -- an experimental mix of pink-yellow Victorian buildings, medieval alleys and Renaissance vaults.

Goat-dung spinach

Sotto le Stelle is a boutique hotel in a former abbot's palace in Picinisco.

A Scottish former lawyer, Cesidio Di Ciacca, has created a luxury resort in Picinisco, called Sotto le Stelle (Via Giustino Ferri, 1/7, Picinisco; +39 3466027120) inside an old abbot's palace.

""I was looking for a place where many descendants of immigrants like myself can come back to and call home,"" he says. ""A point of reference.""

A private helicopter from Rome can take you there. The deluxe apartments' panoramic balconies jut out of the ancient village walls, while the living-room arches were once open-air entrance doors for horse-drawn carts.

Early in the morning village grannies knock at the door and serve en-suite breakfast with tiny hand-woven baskets of fresh goat ricotta called ""fusciella."" For lunch, the concierge treats guests to a dish of wild spinach called ""orapi,"" a supreme delicacy. It's special and hard to find because it grows beneath goat dung which fertilizes it.

Bear-watching tours are organized in the national park.

1 / 33 33 BEAUTIFUL PLACES IN ITALY: Civita di Bagnoregio, Viterbo: Civita was founded by the Etruscans more than 2,500 years ago and sits atop a rocky plateau overlooking the Tiber river valley in central Italy. The town is in constant danger of destruction by erosion and was placed on the World Monuments Watch list in 2006.

Cesidio has even brought back from the grave his ancestors' ghost hamlet and turned it into a thriving farm, I Ciacca (Via Giustino Ferri 7, Picinisco) where ancient Maturano white wine is made alongside extra virgin olive oil and transparent acacia honey.

He's hired local young staff to boost the valley's sleepy economy. Lush vegetation and moss covers rusty unhinged doors and dark rooms where bats have made their homes.

Everything seems frozen in time. You can still spot nails sticking out of ceilings where sausages were hung to dry. When Cesidio dug into the ground he discovered intriguing artifacts such as an old medal of Our Lady of Sorrows and a spoon belonging to Cesidio's grandfather.

Some estimates suggest that at least 20 million barrels a day of new output is needed over the next five years to offset rising oil demand and the natural decline of developed fields, he said.Amin NasserThere seems to be a growing belief that the world can prematurely disengage from proven and reliable energy sources like oil and gas, on the mistaken assumption that alternatives will be rapidly deployed, Nasser said in a speech on Monday. The petroleum industry will be at the heart of global energy for years, and the transition to use of alternatives will be long and complex, he said.The state-run company known formally as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the worlds biggest oil exporter, boosted production to an annual record last year before the kingdom led the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers to curb output to stem a global glut. Aramco is also at the heart of the nations long-term strategy to wean its economy off oil. The government plans to sell about 5 percent of the company in 2018 in what could be a record IPO.Current oil prices wont affect the companys decision for a planned share sale, Nasser told reporters at the conference. Brent crude, the international benchmark, has slid 17 percent this year and was 5 cents higher at $46.94 a barrel at 7:10 a.m. in London.Financial investors are shying away from making much needed large investments in oil exploration, long-term development, and the related infrastructure, Nasser said in his speech, putting part of the blame on what he said were misleading arguments about peak oil demand and stranded resources. The volume of conventional oil discovered around the world over the past four years, for example, is down more than 50 percent from the previous four years, he said.Investments in smaller increments such as shale oil will just not cut it. Yet without those higher investment levels, the energy transition -- and therefore energy security -- may be fatally compromised.Some countries and automakers are starting to move away from fossil fuels for transportation, raising questions about future demand for oil. France plans to end the sale of gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles by 2040 in a bid to become a carbon-neutral nation, and Volvo Car Group said last week its phasing out cars that rely on internal combustion engines. Looking at todays energy mix, the expectations for alternatives are through the roof, Nasser said. While acknowledging that electric vehicles are gaining in popularity, he said they currently make up less than two-tenths of one percent of the worlds 1.2 billion vehicles and were unlikely to account for more than 10 percent of the global fleet by 2030. Electric cars could make up 11 percent to 25 percent of all vehicles by 2040, IHS Markit Ltd. Vice Chairman Daniel Yergin told the conference on Tuesday.Aramco plans to spend $300 billion on projects over the next 10 years to maintain its spare oil production capacity, the biggest by far in OPEC, and boost exploration and output of conventional and unconventional gas, Nasser said.Three hundred billion dollars over 10 years is a strong statement for Saudi Aramco, especially against the backdrop of the current oil environment which has strained the Saudi budget, said Will Hares, an energy analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in London. This may form a response to its concerns of a long-term supply deficit resulting from under-investment in the industry since 2014.Aramcos capital investment program last year was its biggest ever, he said, without specifying what it spent. The company is looking to invest in new offshore oil projects, pending approval by the board, and it isnt planning to increase production capacity with new projects but rather to maintain current oil output, he said.Aramco plans to double its production of gas resources to 23 billion cubic feet a day over the coming decade, Nasser said. The forecast increase will raise the share of gas in the kingdoms utilities to about 70 percent, the highest of any G-20 nation, he said. Saudi Arabia is also committed to developing solar energy and other renewable sources, and the economic restructuring strategy foresees the nations becoming nothing less than a solar powerhouse, he said."
http://cnn.com/2017/07/10/politics/russia-sanctions-trump-treasury-officials-meeting/index.html,TREASURY OFFICIALS MET WITH HILL AIDES ON RUSSIA SANCTIONS,"(CNN) Officials from the State and Treasury Departments met with both Republican and Democratic congressional aides last week to express concerns about the Senate's Russia sanctions bill, two senior congressional staffers confirmed to CNN.

John E. Smith, director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, and other Treasury and State Department officials met with congressional aides from the offices of Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Minority Whip Steny Hoyer and the Foreign Affairs and Financial Services Committees, according to the staffers.

The administration officials, who were career civil servants, expressed concerns during the meeting about the congressional review provisions in the bill, which would give Congress veto power if the White House tries to loosen sanctions on Russia, according to the staffers. The aides noted, however, that the Executive Branch might object to similar provisions.

A senior GOP leadership aide said that there has been a White House effort to ""educate"" Hill Republicans on their concerns with the bill.

Marc Short, Trump's director of legislative affairs, said earlier Monday ""the administration is fully supportive of (current Iran and Russia) sanctions.""

""What our concern is that the legislation, we believe, sets an unusual precedent of delegating foreign policy to 535 members of Congress by not including certain national security waivers that have always been consistently a part of sanctions bills in the past,"" he said.

Stripping those create a ""challenge"" for the administration, and so ""the way its currently drafted is something that neither a Democratic or Republican administration would support.""

The House and Senate have been fighting over the Russia sanctions bill since it passed the Senate last month, 98-2. Before recess, the Senate passed a new version of the bill to address House concerns about a ""blue slip"" violation, over the constitutional requirement that revenue bills begin in the House.

Multiple House GOP aides say there are a couple of snags that are currently being discussed at the leadership level.

One is a concern that Democrats have raised about making the review process for sanctions essentially equal in the House and Senate.

House Democrats say the technical tweaks the Senate made last month make it more difficult to bring a review resolution to a vote in the House.

""There are serious concerns about the process proposed by House Republicans that would limit Congress's oversight role over the administration's implementation of sanctions,"" Hoyer said. ""Under this process, only the Speaker of the House -- rather than any member of the House -- can force consideration of whether to allow the administration to waive sanctions. This is different from the Senate process, where any member can do so; the House ought to have the same authority.""

The second issue is addressing concerns which some energy companies are raising. They say language in the bill adds burdensome disclosure requirements that could put them at a competitive disadvantage with non-US companies working on international deals. There is some hope that they can add an administrative fix to address these concerns without making legislative changes that would force yet another Senate vote on the bill.

One senior GOP House aide familiar with the discussions tells CNN that the House Foreign Affairs Committee supports moving ahead quickly with the bill that passed the Senate, and Chairman Ed Royce's ""patience is going to run out at some point.""

""If things get bogged down, he's not ruled out introducing his own sanctions bill,"" the aide told CNN, adding that a new bill from the California Republican ""would probably be tougher than what the Senate passed."""

Dalian Wanda Group announced plans Monday to sell a 91% stake in more than a dozen tourist attractions to Sunac China Holdings. The $9.3 billion deal also includes 76 Wanda hotels.

Wanda and Sunac said in a joint statement that the deal will be finalized by the end of July.

The move comes a year after Wanda founder Wang Jianlin vowed to crush Disney's (DIS) business in China, comparing his theme parks to ""a pack of wolves.""

Related: Billionaire vows to crush Disney in China

""Disney really shouldn't have come to China,"" he said in May 2016. ""Its financial prospects don't look so good to me.""

Theme parks were a key part of Wang's plans to turn his firm into a major player in real entertainment, tourism and sports. In its 2016 annual report, Wanda said that the success of two new parks -- in Nanchang and Hefei -- had inspired it to export the model abroad.

While Wanda is giving up its controlling stake in the parks, they will continue to use the firm's branding. Wanda will also operate the parks.

Wang said Monday that the sale should help improve Wanda's balance sheet, which has been weighed down by debts after years of aggressive expansion.

""The group's debt-asset ratio will drop dramatically,"" Wang told Chinese business magazine Caixin.

Wang, who is the China's richest man, has long been bullish about investing in entertainment -- especially in the U.S.

Wanda bought U.S. theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) in 2012, and it snapped up Hollywood studio Legendary Entertainment last year for $3.5 billion.

Wang has also repeatedly expressed an interest in buying one of the ""Big Six"" studios in Hollywood. As recently as January, he told a European conference that if one of those big studios came on the market, he would be ""a happy buyer.""

But a broader Chinese government crackdown on overseas investments may have curbed Wang's ambitions. To rein in capital outflows, China has been spending hundreds of billions of dollars to prop up its currency, and restricting investments and acquisitions overseas.

In March, Wang $1 billion bid to buy Dick Clark Productions was terminated. Eldridge industries, the production company's owner, said that it killed the deal after Wanda ""failed to honor its contractual obligations."""

No final decision has been made and the company may choose not to pursue a sale, they said.A representative for Rambus declined to comment.Rambus jumped as much as 15 percent Friday, the most since Dec. 10, 2013, when it settled a licensing dispute with chipmaker Micron Technology Inc. The shares, after a brief suspension in trading, were up 9.3 percent to $12.38 at 3:40 p.m. in New York.Consolidation in the semiconductor industry has slowed since chipmakers spent a record $113 billion on acquisitions in 2015. While 15 deals valued at more than $1 billion were announced in 2016, just three deals of that size have been announced this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Shares in Rambus, with a market value of $1.4 billion, have fallen about 20 percent this year, underperforming the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. The index, composed of 30 chip-related companies, is up 16 percent this year.The company, which owns more than 2,500 patents, has battled in court with many of the largest-makers of computer-memory chips, arguing that its patents cover some of the fundamentals essential to the design of the components. It began restructuring in 2015, and has since expanded beyond its semiconductor design and licensing business to start selling its own branded chips made by a supplier.The new products are part of Rambuss push for a larger footprint in chips for data centers and mobile devices. The company has also grown its cyber security division.In February, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Paul Coster said the R&D initiatives launched by the company could disrupt the data center industry, and that success in one or more of these initiatives could make Rambus of interest to a buyer.Rambus announced a broad licensing agreement in March with Western Digital Corp. that covers the use of Rambus patented memory technologies in Western Digital products through 2021.The companys efforts to dominate broad swathes of the chip industry with its technology relied on litigation for most of the past two decades, including court fights with Micron and other chipmakers.The companys prospects may have peaked in the late 1990s when Intel Corp. sought to have Rambus designs adopted as an industry standard for main memory. When other companies refused to fall in line, Intel backed down and Rambuss technology became marginalized."

Opioid medications bind to the areas of the brain that control pain and emotions, driving up levels of the feel-good hormone dopamine in the brain's reward areas and producing an intense feeling of euphoria.



As the brain becomes used to the feelings, it often takes more and more of the drug to produce the same levels of pain relief and well-being, leading to dependence and, later, addiction. Hide Caption 1 of 12

It has frequently been used for pain relief after removal of tonsils and adenoids in children.



After an investigation, the FDA restricted the use of codeine and tramadol in children under 12 and recommend against their use in children between 12 and 18 years of age.

http://cnn.com/2017/07/08/politics/us-russia-leaders-syrian-conflict-analysis/index.html,"US AND RUSSIA INCH CLOSER TO COOPERATING ON SYRIA, BUT LONG ROAD LIES AHEAD","(CNN) Both sides have described the meeting of Presidents Trump and Putin in Hamburg on Friday as constructive and businesslike -- and both highlighted the possibility of greater cooperation in ending the Syrian conflict.

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the two leaders had reached an agreement on curbing violence in Syria.

The first step toward that was agreement on establishing a ceasefire and de-escalation zone in southwest Syria, in the province of Deraa and along the Lebanese border. It's an area that has seen intense combat recently among many competing groups. The US and Jordan have been backing moderate rebel groups in southern Syria against the regime.

Tillerson, who joined the talks in Hamburg, said the ceasefire was a ""defined agreement"" and could be a precursor to further cooperation in Syria. His Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, said the US and Russia had ""promised to ensure that all groups there comply with the ceasefire,"" which will come into effect Sunday and be underwritten by Russian military police coordinating with the US and Jordan.

""This is our first indication of the US and Russia being able to work together in Syria,"" he said.

It will be a test case for future collaboration. Tillerson earlier this week called on all parties in Syria (minus ISIS and factions allied to al Qaeda) ""to avoid conflict with one another and adhere to agreed geographical boundaries for military de-confliction and protocols for de-escalation."" And on Friday he said the Hamburg meeting included ""a very lengthy discussion regarding other areas in Syria"" beyond Deraa.

Russia, Turkey and Iran already have established four de-confliction zones in other parts of Syria. They have seen a reduction in violence but have not been accepted by a number of rebel groups, and their borders and the mechanics for monitoring the zones have yet to be ironed out .

The area in southern Syria will be the first in which the US is party to such a zone.

Fighting two separate wars

So the opening phase of cooperation is likely to be about avoiding unintended consequences, especially as both sides (US plus Syrian Democratic Forces/regime plus Russia and Iran) race to secure oil-rich parts of eastern Syria where ISIS is still hanging on.

But the two governments still have very different long-term goals in Syria. Russia has spent the last two years supporting the Assad regime militarily -- with airstrikes and special forces on the ground. In that time, the regime has gradually reasserted control over major cities, with rebel groups being finally driven out of Aleppo, the largest city in Syria, at the beginning of this year.

JUST WATCHED Meet the key players in Syria's civil war Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Meet the key players in Syria's civil war 02:22

Together with Iran and Turkey, Moscow has set up its own peace talks for Syria and negotiated the transfer of hundreds of rebel fighters and their families to the northwest province of Idlib, which remains outside regime control but heavily damaged.

The US has focused on defeating ISIS by nurturing the Syrian Democratic Forces, an alliance of Arab tribes and Kurds, in the north and east of the country. Gradually, they have pushed ISIS out of large swathes of territory, aided by hundreds of coalition airstrikes, and are now inside Raqqa -- ISIS' 'capital' in Syria.

The US has also deployed troops to the border with Iraq in an effort to prevent Iran from creating a 'land-bridge' into Syria, and by extension into Lebanon, where Iran is a long-time supporter of the Hezbollah Shia militia.

In essence Moscow and Washington have been fighting two separate wars, sometimes at close quarters. Last month, the US shot down a regime jet threatening SDF forces near Raqqa.

Long way to go toward a consensus

There's a long way to go before agreement can be reached on the long-term future of Syria.

First, there's the question of Iranian involvement on the side of the regime. Iran has committed elements of the al Quds force and other militia to the battle, and provided substantial financial support to the regime. The US and its main regional ally, Israel, want Russia to help reduce the Iranian footprint in Syria. The Trump administration has taken a much more adversarial position toward Iran than its predecessor, and the deployment of small numbers of US troops on the Iraq-Syria border, where there are also pro-Iranian militia (on both sides of the border), may be seen as a sign of that larger goal.

Then there's the future of President Bashar al-Assad. The Obama administration insisted that he must relinquish power as part of any final settlement. But the Trump administration seems equivocal about that.

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Friday that the administration sees ""no long-term role for the Assad family or the Assad regime.""

""How Assad leaves is yet to be determined,"" Tillerson told reporters in Hamburg. ""There will be a transition away from the Assad family,"" he said.

But the President suggested after the chemical weapons attack in April -- which triggered a barrage of US cruise missiles against a Syrian airbase -- that ""with the acts that [Assad] has taken, it would seem that there would be no role for him to govern the Syrian people.""

Thirdly, there's the question of what happens to US allies on the ground -- and specifically the SDF. There's no coordination yet on who will lead the assault on ISIS' last main bastion in Syria -- the city of Deir Ezzour near the Iraqi border. US sponsorship of the SDF and its control of much of northern Syria is a significant bargaining chip going forward.

Fourthly, how will any process toward stability be handled? Russia, Iran and Turkey have set up what's called the Astana process, in which the US has not been involved and of which Syrian rebels are very wary, regarding Iran as a ""hostile state."" Will the US now participate in that process, or demand the revival of a UN-led peace process?

What would peace look like?

All of which leads to the biggest and thorniest of issues: What would a Syria at peace look like? Would Bashar al Assad allow areas of self-rule? He has previously ruled that out, vowing to clear ""every terrorist"" from Syria.

How would the immense task of reconstruction -- measured in the tens of billions of dollars -- be addressed? Russia certainly doesn't have the resources to carry it out, but extremism is likely to breed again if much of the country remains in ruins.

Tillerson has said that if the US and Russia can ""work together to establish stability on the ground, it will lay a foundation for progress on the settlement of Syria's political future."" And he sees an opportunity now because, as he put it in Hamburg, ""in many respects, people are getting tired. They're getting weary of the conflict.""

There will be plenty of skeptics and some vocal opposition in Congress from the likes of Senator John McCain to any ""arrangement"" with Putin and Assad and especially any cooperation on the ground with the Russian military.

But perhaps, just perhaps, the first brick in the foundation Tillerson speaks of is about to be laid."

After the ""gender reveal"" party was over, a dozen or so people, including children, had reportedly settled in to watch a ""Spider-Man"" movie

That's when terror came in.

Police near Cincinnati say two gunmen in hoodies opened fire with handguns, killing a woman and wounded eight others, including three children.

Now, instead of celebrating new life, the group will be mourning a loss and caring for the injured.

Questions remain

Autum Garrett, 22, who authorities believe is from Huntington, Indiana, was pronounced dead at the scene.

The eight other victims, including an 8-year-old, 6-year-old and 2-year-old, suffered non-life threatening injuries, police said.

The injured were taken to Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and University of Cincinnati Medical Center, authorities said. Colerain Township, Ohio, is about nine miles northwest of Cincinnati.

The suspects remain unknown and at large.

""We don't know who the suspects are or why they did this,"" said Mark Denney, chief of police in Colerain Township, on Sunday evening. ""We're not sure if (the suspects) were allowed in or they forced entry at this point.""

A gender reveal party often involves the expectant parents and their gathered guests learning the soon-to-arrive baby's gender at the same time. It includes a dramatic moment when pink or blue is revealed to all gathered -- by opening a box that's full of balloons in one of the colors, for instance, or slicing a cake to reveal blue or pink coloring inside.

A family member told CNN affiliate WLWT that a pregnant woman was shot in the leg and lost her baby. The woman has been treated and released from the hospital, the station reported. Denney couldn't confirm that detail. It was not clear whether she was the guest of honor.

Police also didn't know how many people were in the home for the party or the possible relationship between the suspect and the victims, Denney said.

James Love, spokesman for the Colerain Township Police Department, told HLN's Erica Hill Monday that investigators are following every lead they get. ""This situation seems to have come out of the blue,"" Love said.

""We as police and the community has been recently coming together, trying to unite ourselves, trying to create a community sense, once again trying to put up good defenses,"" he said. ""Lights, cameras and everything else to try to cut down on what has become a problem in this neighborhood.""

Love said he wouldn't call the neighborhood crime-ridden, ""but it is an area that we do focus on.""

The group had just started to watch the movie when the violence began, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported.

Emergency calls

In 911 calls from the incident obtained by CNN affiliate WCPO , witnesses sound panicked and confused as to what has happened.

""There's a whole lot of people here are shot,"" one man tells the operator, as people scream in the background.

""I just seen two people walk by, I looked outside, next thing I know they just ran in and just start shooting,"" the man says. He tells the operator he thinks he has been shot in the stomach and that he's bleeding.

Another woman calls 911 from outside the house.

""There is little kids hurt and everything,"" she says. ""I was sitting in my car, they just ran in and started shooting. There's a pregnant girl here ... oh my God.""

At the request of the operator the woman yells at people in the house to find out how many people have been shot, but is unable to establish the number. She says she saw the gunmen run away.

One caller says, ""We were having a baby shower, like a reveal party.""

A neighbor calls emergency services, but cannot provide details of the injured.

""Ma'am, all I know is, I don't know what's going on, all I know is she's a neighbor. I was at home minding my business and I just heard someone in distress banging on my door and a young lady was bleeding and she said she'd been shot and so had someone else and I just tried to come out and see what was going on,"" she says.

'It was horrific'

Candice Verga, a family friend who attended the party, told WLWT it was ""positive"" and ""happy."" All of that changed when she heard the gunshots.

""Everybody's screaming and crying and it's just all panic and I'm even shaking and everything,"" Verga said.

Neighbor Cheyenne Sizemore heard what sounded like six to seven gunshots, according to WLWT.

""It was a pretty quick succession, it was one after the other, like they went in there and they unloaded as many bullets as they possibly could and then ran off,"" Sizemore said.

Officers were dispatched to a call of shots fired about 11:21 p.m., police said.

One responding officer said ""it was horrific, something that was unimaginable,"" Love said.

Denney urged residents to take the same reasonable precautions they always do, including calling police if they see something suspicious and locking their doors.

""But we have no information that makes us believe there is any specific threat to our community,"" the police chief said.

""Our hearts are heavy with what we've seen and experienced in our community,"" Love said."

Sending his wife back to the car to get his phone, Alves walked up the remaining nine floors to his apartment and collected his two children Tiago, 20, and Ines, 16, to get them all outside, just in case the fire grew worse.

They now believe the events of that night were a miracle, with fate ensuring that they saw the signs to make an early escape. They escaped with just a phone, his son's wallet and his daughter's school notes. She went on to take her exam the next day.

But now, three weeks later, it hurts coming back to his home, he said, seeing his former palace destroyed. ""It's difficult to cope,"" he said.

Despite the pain, Alves comes back every day, he admits, on autopilot mostly, having returned here every day for the past 19 years. ""It's automatic. The first thing I do is come around here. ... It's still my home.""

The Alves family -- Tiago, Fatima, Ines and Miguel -- are active members of their church.

Life in limbo

Leaving the tower behind, Alves goes to his current home: a small hotel room.

His family resides here with more than 10 other residents of the tower block while the local council government works to rehouse the hundreds left homeless.

Alves has lived here for just over two weeks, sharing a room with his wife while their two children sleep in a room on another floor.

""We need to feel as a family,"" he said. ""To talk to (our kids), we have to ask them to come to our room or we go to their room, and that is not ideal.""

Just a few clothes fill the wardrobe and a small suitcase that sits on the floor.

A single suitcase accompanies a few clothes in the wardrobe of the Alveses' hotel room.

""We have lost everything, even small socks that we like the most or a pair of shoes we are missing from everyday life,"" Alves said.

The desk is littered with snacks, breakfast bars and water for emergencies, as they live without a kitchen in which to cook the meals they now crave.

""We need to ... sit and have dinner together on our own, not with other people,"" he said.

Alves says the family has been fortunate in that they belong to a strong Portuguese community and are active members of their church. They do not need to eat out but are instead hosted most evenings by close friends in the area.

But life is still far from what anyone would desire.

""It's not the same thing to have our own family dinners and talk about small things that are important for life,"" he said.

Miguel and Fatima Alves' home for the past two weeks has been a hotel room.

It's clear the Alves family is very close.

Tiago has been helping with the extensive paperwork needed to get their lives back in order. He is on summer break from college, where he is working toward a degree in physics. Ines is also on her summer break from high school.

Alves has returned to work as a chauffeur, which he said has helped him cope by carrying on with life, retaining some normalcy. His wife Fatima, 47, has yet to return to work as a maid and instead spends her days handling the endless minutiae of living away from and securing their home.

She leaves the hotel with bags of laundry to take to friends' houses. At other times, she is swapping belongings from the hotel room with those kept with friends to prevent their hotel rooms from becoming cramped. Most of these belongings come from donations made to shelters during the first days after the fire.

Fatima Alves says she uses her rosary beads three times a day.

""I have so many things to do: sorting out clothes, toiletries ... and going to meetings,"" Fatima Alves said.

For her, religion and friends have been key in helping with the events of the past few weeks. Rosary beads, which she uses three times a day, sit by the bed in her hotel room.

Research has found strong evidence linking religion to better mental health, not due to any specific kind of belief but instead the mere existence of it -- something giving people hope, support and perhaps even fuel to live a healthier lifestyle.

Miguel Alves and his wife, Fatima, sing in the choir of their Portuguese community church.

Since the fire, neither parent has been sleeping well, averaging just four hours most nights.

""When I close my eyes, I can see the people waving on the windows,"" she said. ""This is my trauma. Not seeing my flat burning. ... The worst part was people begging for help ... and we couldn't do anything.""

Alves experiences the same vivid recall and wakes up anxious most nights. ""It's difficult to see those types of images,"" he said.

But once his eyes are open and the day begins, his priority is moving forward and doing whatever it takes to give his family a home, a life.

""The most important thing is to move on and put all that behind our back,"" Alves said, explaining that he will be able to process the shock once his family's lives are back in some form of order. ""This is something I never will forget.""

Psychological first aid

When, like the Alveses, a family is left with only the most meager belongings, there is no way to predict how they will deal with the sudden change in situation.

""No two people respond the same. ... There isn't a single answer,"" said Sir Simon Wessely, immediate past president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and professor of psychiatry at Kings College London. ""People often have strength and depths in these events.""

For Alves, humor has always been a lifeline, helping him stay positive whatever the situation. Jokes are frequent as he describes his life now. ""A sense of humor helps me to carry on. ... It's something for myself to cope.""

The Royal College of Psychiatrists has led a range of research on how best to respond and offer mental support to people who have gone through extreme events, such as the 2005 London bombings.

Wessely explained that there is a general order of interventions that response teams should follow: checking and confirming that people are safe; aiding communication between those affected by the incident, such as by providing mobile phones; and finally, practical and emotional support, to get them home or to a safe place, to retrieve some belongings or simply to offer frequent hugs and cups of tea.

People arrive with trays of food for people evacuated from their properties, close to Grenfell Tower, on June 14.

Some experts include these common-sense measures as part of the ""psychological first aid"" deployed after disasters, which aims to help people manage the immediate stress and hopefully prevent post-traumatic stress disorder down the line.

Doing any more, experts say, may not be worth it.

""The vast majority of people in any such disaster do fine; that's the good news,"" said Dr. Robert Ursano, chairman of the American Psychiatric Association's Committee on Psychiatric Dimensions of Disasters. ""The problem is, you have to intervene with so many people in order to prevent one or two cases.""

Wessely adds that intervening too early can also be harmful.

""If (psychiatrists) get involved too early, that is not just useless but counterproductive,"" he said. ""(They) do more harm than good. ... You're getting in the way of natural coping mechanisms.""

Some studies have showed that providing formal psychiatric treatment too early can actually increase the risk of developing PTSD, while others have shown no effect. Both outcomes suggest that resources may better be used elsewhere.

The Alveses are experiencing the horrors of the fire in their sleep -- not of their own loss but of others losing their lives and begging at their windows for help. If they are forced to recall these images and talk about them too early, the impact can be detrimental rather than helpful, experts say.

Clothes are offered to those affected by the fire that ripped through Grenfell Tower, a residential block in west London on June 14.

By eight to 18 weeks, professional support is typically necessary in only 20% to 25% of people, Wessely said. However, he adds that the anger and bitterness associated with the Grenfell fire, and that it could have been avoided, could lead to greater numbers needing more long-term help to recover.

The fire is suspected to have been stoked by the building's flammable exterior cladding , which was used to cut costs during a recent refurbishment of the building.

""They will have more prolonged grief and complications,"" he said.

People are more likely to need professional support if they have a history of mental health problems, if they live in isolation and therefore lack social support, if they're left feeling bitter or angry -- as is the case with Grenfell -- and if they are feeling guilty that they didn't help or save someone when they could have, according to Wessely.

For those who do suffer prolonged trauma, it's crucial that someone notice and make treatment available, Ursano added.

""There's substantial numbers of people that have problems that can extend over a long period of time,"" he said. ""PTSD can become chronic and enduring.""

Lessons from past survivors

Going back to a routine is one way to normalize after a major traumatic event and help people regain the lives they have lost, particularly in children, Ursano said.

This is what the Alves family has done, despite living out of a suitcase. Tiago is about to start an internship, and Ines makes sure to see friends over her school break.

Previous disasters in which people have lost everything carry the stories of millions who have been there before and managed to make it through.

But they all began with a moment of limbo.

""You wake up in the morning ... and it takes about 15 or 20 seconds, and then ... this sort of pall of depression reclaims you because you realize, oh, yeah, all my stuff is gone,"" Blake Bailey, a writer and survivor of Hurricane Katrina, said in a 2009 interview with NPR

Blake Bailey's home, sealed up after Hurricane Katrina.

In 2005, Katrina struck five Southern states, killing more than 1,800 and leaving thousands more homeless.

Bailey, now 54, and his wife and daughter packed up a few clothes and a laptop. ""But everything else was gone,"" he told CNN. He used to live with his family in New Orleans, having relocated there just two months before the storm, but now lives in Virginia.

The damage left him in debt, fighting with home finance companies for years after. He had lost his home, his stability and his memories, such as photo albums from his wedding.

""You don't have the same morbid attachment to your things ever again,"" he said.

Ursano agrees: ""We have a whole picture of the world of grief, but it's usually around people. And we don't talk often about the question of the loss of significant items that anchor us to our life.""

For Bailey, his salvation was that he had a major project to focus on: a biography of American writer John Cheever , which he published in 2009.

""I really dug in and used every spare second I had to work on that (book),"" he said.

Disasters bring some victims closer together as a family -- and a community.

""My kids were devastated during that time. ... I just focused on how to handle the trauma that they had,"" said Kitchie Ortega, a customer services representative in Manila, Philippines, who survived Typhoon Ondoy, also known as tropical storm Ketsana, in 2009. She added that her family became closer after the storm, as did her entire neighborhood.

Her home was destroyed in the typhoon, which killed more than 400 people and caused more than 70,000 people to be evacuated from their homes, according to the National Disaster Coordinating Council in the Philippines.

Houses destroyed by flooding brought by typhoon Ketsana, also known as tropical storm Ondoy, in Marikina City, Philippines in 2009.

""Any time, anyone can leave you,"" Ortega said. ""I made sure that I support everything that they do after that incident, because I don't want to regret anything.""

Ursano explained that traumatic events can change lives for the better, an outcome known as ""post-traumatic growth.""

This could eventually be the case for the Alves family. Although Tiago and Miguel bicker more over all the paperwork, the son has also seen a nervous side to his father -- a side he wants to help.

A family united

""We're stronger than ever before,"" Tiago Alves said. ""The tragedy has helped us be more united.""

His father agrees and hopes that once their shock subsides and they begin registering what has happened to them, they will have more security regarding their future.

Friends have hosted the Alves family for meals most evenings.

""Before, we looked at life as whole. ... Now, it's one day after the other,"" said Alves, who just wants the uncertainty surrounding his life to be over.

""Now, what we want is just a new house and to carry on our lives without being anxious of the future,"" he said. ""It's important to put everything behind us and carry on with our lives.""

But Wessely warns that experts will need to reach out to the family in a few months, just to ensure that they are OK and coping with reality.

There is ""potential risk of psychiatric disorder,"" he said. ""Putting everything behind you is not always the best in the long term."""
http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/06/entertainment/asian-actors-hollywood/index.html,"BEYOND 'NERDS' AND 'NINJAS,' SLOW PROGRESS FOR ASIAN ACTORS IN HOLLYWOOD","(CNN) Like any actor, Lewis Tan likes to play the central character in a story.

""Asian actors want to play the lead, the romantic character, the hero, just like everyone else,"" Tan told CNN.

And like most Asian and Asian American actors, Tan has had to battle stereotypes.

""We're cast as ninjas, monks, nerds, the third, fourth, fifth best friend who is a nerd, killers, doctors and for women, the sexy Asian woman who's dating a white guy,"" Tan quipped.

The actor, who is of Chinese, Singaporean and British descent, most recently starred as Zhou Cheng in the Netflix series ""Iron Fist.""

The action-packed show follows the adventures of a martial artist who possesses a mystical force.

Yet the central role went to white actor, Finn Jones, to the dismay of some viewers who wanted to see Tan in the part even though the character in the comic ""Iron Fist"" isn't Asian.

Regardless, Tan considers his role on the show a win.

""It's an exciting time in a lot of ways because things are opening up,"" Tan said. ""There was a time when things weren't as open for [Asian actors], so it's exciting for me to see actors being booked and called in for roles.""

To date, the call for increased diversity in the film and television industry has primarily focused on opportunities for African American, Latino and LGBT creatives, with artists of Asian descent somewhat ignored.

That felt evident to some at the 2016 Academy Awards.

Even as #OscarsSoWhite took center stage, host Chris Rock made a joke using three Asian child actors that resulted in two dozen Asian members of the Academy crafting an open letter demanding an apology.

""In light of criticism over #OscarsSoWhite, we were hopeful that the telecast would provide the Academy a way forward and the chance to present a spectacular example of inclusion and diversity,"" the letter read. ""Instead, the Oscars show was marred by a tone-deaf approach to its portrayal of Asians.""

There has been some notable progress with portrayals in Aziz Ansari's critically acclaimed Netflix series ""Master of None"" and ABC's sitcom-hit ""Fresh Off The Boat,"" but other projects showcase the challenges many Asian performers still face.

Actors Daniel Dae Kim and Grace Park departed the CBS drama ""Hawaii Five-0"" last week over a reported pay disparity between the actors and their white co-stars.

""The path to equality is rarely easy,"" Kim wrote in a Facebook post about leaving the show. ""But I hope you can be excited for the future. I am.""

""As an Asian American actor, I know first-hand how difficult it is to find opportunities at all, let alone play a well developed, three dimensional character like Chin Ho,"" he also said. ""I will miss him sincerely.""

Tan, who spoke to CNN prior to Kim and Park leaving their show, said while he'd like to see even more opportunities for actors of Asian descent, he applauds the inclusion of people of color period.

""I want to see everyone rise,"" he said. ""I think we all will have our time, if we push it, if we do the work and if we make our voices heard."""

The cause of death was complications from heart failure, his manager, Emily Gerson Saines, told CNN.

Ellis had roles in several movies during his career, including ""Get on Up,"" ""Lee Daniels' The Butler"" and ""The Help."" But he was best known for his performance on ""True Blood"" as Lafayette, a cook and medium whose tell-it-like-it-is attitude made him a favorite among the television show's fans.

HBO said in a statement Saturday that it was ""extremely saddened"" to hear of his passing.

""Nelsan was a long-time member of the HBO family whose groundbreaking portrayal of Lafayette will be remembered fondly within the overall legacy of True Blood. Nelsan will be dearly missed by his fans and all of us at HBO,"" the statement read. HBO, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.

""True Blood"" creator Alan Ball added: ""Nelsan was a singular talent whose creativity never ceased to amaze me. Working with him was a privilege.""

Octavia Spencer, who worked with Ellis on ""The Help,"" paid tribute to him on Instagram: ""My heart breaks for his kids and family.""

Australia rocks!! https://t.co/c1DD7xtC90Tesla will provide 100 megawatts of battery storage by Dec. 1, pairing it with a wind farm at Hornsdale north of Adelaide operated by Frances Neoen, according to a statement on Friday from South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill. The system, which will have capacity of 129 megawatt-hours, will provide enough power for more than 30,000 homes, Tesla said in a separate statement.@mcannonbrookes Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?Musk four months ago promised on Twitter to build the energy storage system and get it working within 100 days of a contract being signed or Tesla would provide it free, a vow he backed up on Friday.We actually insisted when doing the contract that we be held to the 100 days or its free, Musk said. Thats what we said publicly, thats what were going to do.Should the project be up and running in the next 100 days, it would likely be the worlds largest lithium-ion battery, said Simon Habart, a Hong-Kong based research analyst with Bloomberg New Energy Finance. ""The competition for primacy will be tight, as projects of similar size are rapidly springing up in Australia, Canada and Japan.""The project win follows a difficult week for Tesla, which lost about $12 billion in market value after reporting underwhelming sales, and faces increasing competition from Volvo Car Group, which vowed to electrify much of its its vehicle lineup over the next few years. Tesla fell less than one percent to $308.38 at 9:44 a.m. in New York.Battery storage is the future of our national energy market and the eyes of the world will be following our leadership in this space, Weatherill said in the statement.

Tesla successfully installed the system in 3 months.Musks pledge to bring battery storage to South Australia thrust him into the middle of a messy political spat over energy policy. A series of power outages in South Australia have raised fears of more widespread blackouts across the nations electricity market and raised questions as to why one of the worlds largest producers of coal and gas is struggling to keep the lights on in a mainland state.Musks 100-day battery promise found a receptive ear in Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who made innovation a flagship policy ahead of an election last year and, prior to politics, made a fortune in the late 1990s dotcom boom.Australia is expected to invest A$69 billion ($52.46 billion) in rooftop solar and battery storage by 2040, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.Energy storage will be a priority this year, Turnbull tweeted back in March.

The NYT reports that an email said she would provide information from the Russian government

Washington (CNN) An email sent to Donald Trump Jr. last year stated that a Russian lawyer had ""compromising"" information about Hillary Clinton as ""part of a Russian government effort"" to help the Trump campaign, The New York Times reported Monday.

Citing three people with knowledge of the email, the Times reported that Rob Goldstone, who connected Trump Jr. with the Russian lawyer, sent the email to Trump Jr. pointing to the Russian government as a source of potential information that could damage Clinton.

The story that Trump Jr. was offered potential information from the Russian government to aide his father's campaign came after months of staunch denials from President Donald Trump that his campaign had a connection to Russia.

Alan Futerfas, a lawyer for Trump Jr., said in a statement following the story that it was ""much ado about nothing."" The statement called the period of May to early June 2016 ""an intensely busy time"" for Trump Jr. The statement said Goldstone had emailed Trump's son about alleged wrongdoing from Clinton regarding Russia.

""The meeting lasted about 20-30 minutes, and nothing came of it,"" Futerfas said. ""His father knew nothing about it. The bottom line is that Don, Jr. did nothing wrong. I have been representing people in investigatory matters for almost 30 years, and I see nothing here.""

http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/10/opinions/no-world-leader-g20-opinion-hockenos/index.html,WHO IS THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD?,"Paul Hockenos is the author of four books on Europe, the most recent being "" Berlin Calling: A Story of Anarchy, Music, the Wall and the Birth of the New Berlin ."" The views expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) In terms of its letter, the content of the final G20 communiquÃÂ© was vague and meager: on the surface, hardly worth all the fuss and cost, not least to the ransacked city of Hamburg, the meeting's beleaguered host. On just about every issue -- from trade to aid for Africa -- the world's 20 headline economies found consensus only on the lowest common denominator, in watered down resolutions worth little on their own.

The gathering in Hamburg will probably go down in history, not for nuts-and-bolts policy-making, but rather as a watershed moment when the world's emerging and middle-weight powers took a decisive step out from the shadow of the United States and toward a globalized world order.

The G20 underscored more emphatically than ever before that there is no one leader of the free world anymore.

This distributive, collective ethos is exactly why the G20 was called to life in the first place in 1999 -- to reflect the needs and interests of a multi-polar world, not just the rich and Western. Indeed, its raison d'ÃÂªtre was to shift power from the hands of the developed world's few to the globe's many: among them Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Turkey. After all, the 20 economies together account for 80% of the global economy, two-thirds of the world population and over 75% of global trade.

Of course, the United States hasn't played the part of the world's principal for some time now, at least since the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in the early 2000s. Clout, economic as well as military, has since become more dispersed across the globe with centers of regional power in Europe, Asia and South America.

Even if there were an American president more internationally minded than Donald Trump, the world's chief plights -- terrorism, climate change, migration, nuclear proliferation -- are all cross-border scourges that demand global responses with measures that apply locally.

Despite this, the Europeans -- among others -- still seem to defer to Washington on the tough issues, grumbling along the way but unwilling to break rank. Certainly, one reason for this is that they haven't been able to replace the nuclear umbrella and US security guarantees with a fully fledged defense architecture of their own. NATO remains Europe's security blanket, with the United States as the top gun and the Europeans as the ranch hands who sign up for foreign military interventions a la carte, the way sheriffs once rounded up cowboys.

But this Cold War-era state of affairs is ever less tenable or fitting, as comfortable as it once may have been.

Indeed, the Trump administration has thrown this status quo into disarray, for example by initially wavering -- until his most recent trip to Poland -- in the American commitment to coming to the aid of its fellow NATO members, should they require it.

Moreover, Trump's isolationist leanings, his protectionist sympathies and, in general, the ""America First"" attitude has created a vacuum -- one calling out for another figure to manage global trade, security, environment and other burning issues.

In Hamburg, despite all of the vapid diplomacy-speak, the outlines of an important new decision-making method came briefly into focus. (The world hadn't glimpsed such a method since Paris in 2015, when 195 countries pledged to address the issues of climate change.)

At the G20, Germany managed to hold together an extremely diverse group of countries, including the United States but also Russia and Turkey, whose authoritarian leaderships and me-first policies hardly pale compared to Washington's. Russia's Vladimir Putin and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan were spoiling for fights with the European Union over human rights and other matters. And yet Germany's Angela Merkel and others managed to get everyone on board, save for one issue.

Not surprisingly, it was international climate protection that proved the most problematic, with the President refusing to budge on pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement. In the run-up to the summit, Germany's negotiators gutted their original, far-reaching agenda on climate protection, removing, at Washington's behest, the phasing out of coal production and the ending of fossil fuel subsidies by 2025. It looked like Germany intended to polish its diplomatic credentials by preserving unity on every issue, the outcome secondary to the symbolism of all-the-world on the same page.

Yet, the G19 -- the 20 minus the Trump administration -- went forward on climate and reconfirmed an international commitment to the Paris accord, which had begun to unravel since it was signed in late 2015. And, indeed, the Paris consensus could have disintegrated had other countries accepted an American compromise condoning coal and not mentioning the Paris accord, or had the assembly found no agreement at all, with half a dozen or more nations peeling off in opposition.

Washington's intransigence could easily have served as cover for others unenthusiastic about climate policy, such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia, to bolt. But Merkel and her cohorts -- other Europeans and Canada above all -- rallied the stragglers in the final minutes.

Importantly, it wasn't Merkel alone who pulled off the coup -- and she won't suddenly materialize as the new leader of the Western world, a role she neither wants nor could handle. (Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron would be extremely content with leading the EU out of its current deep crisis.) It must be kept in mind that Merkel has working beside her Germany's Social Democrats, her left-wing partners in government and a diplomatic force in their own right, involved in all the negotiations.

Moreover, allies rallied to Germany's side, including the United Kingdom and France, and together acted as a concerned, engaged collective that put the world first rather than their own nations -- a laudable team effort that stands starkly counter to the selfish motives of the Trump administration and the disintegration that characterizes the EU at the moment.

Of course, there's much more that the G19 could have done for climate -- and in other areas, too. Unfortunately, there was no date set for shutting down that last coal-fired power plant. And there aren't any details for Merkel's new ""partnership with Africa.""

But as vastly different as they are, the world's nations beyond the United States have common interests and can work together. This is what the Hamburg summit confirmed -- and is thus a reason to feel a little more optimistic about the state of the world. Next time, though, its leaders have to bring more vision and ambition to the table, whether the United States is playing ball or not."

She is the author of ""Ashley's War: The Untold Story of a Team of Women Soldiers on the Special Ops Battlefield."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.

(CNN) The Afghan war may live far from the headlines, but US soldiers are not far from the battlefield.

A 19-year-old Army soldier, Pfc. Hansen Kirkpatrick, lost his life in Afghanistan due to "" indirect fire "" on July 3. His death marks the eighth loss this year for Americans serving in their nation's longest war.

In a Facebook post now taken down but reported on by local media , his mother, Anngel Norkist, urged people to remember the sacrifice of her son and his fellow soldiers still serving in Afghanistan. Norkist confirmed to me by telephone that the post was hers.

""Please seriously stop! Take a moment. Realize that real actual blood dropped on a battlefield for YOU. That's what the red symbolizes on our flag. My son just died today...over on some nasty, dry battlefield in a far off land. His life was cut short at only 19. Stop and really give thanks for all those who gave and continue to give us our freedoms we so easily take for freakin granted,"" Norkist wrote.

""Do not comment and say how sorry you are! I don't care!! Actions speak louder than words, so GO MAKE A DIFFERENCE!""

This sentiment underscores a hard reality: These losses should be our country's losses, and right now they don't feel like it. They feel quarantined, experienced by a grieving few instead of a nationwide many.

A fraction of the American population has fought 100% of its wars for 16 years. Precious few Americans are paying attention.

In the future, news about American battlefield losses may be even slower to reach the headlines. The Pentagon has announced a new policy stating that it will hold all information about US troop deaths until one day after notification of next-of-kin.

A spokesman for Army Gen. John Nicholson, who leads US and NATO forces in Afghanistan, said there are simply too few soldiers serving in Afghanistan now for ""non-identifying"" announcements of US deaths to remain anonymous -- especially in the age of social media.

""Gen. Nicholson is insistent that the support system for family members of our fallen and wounded warriors is in place with those families prior to public release; hence the 24-hour hold after next-of-kin notification,"" said Capt. William Salvin , a spokesman for the US led coalition in Afghanistan.

""Information that we have historically released that was considered 'non-identifying information' has become identifiable given that we have such a limited footprint in Afghanistan.""

While the motivation to hold back potentially identifiable information is understandable, the policy should not mean that the American public hears even less than they already do about lives lost in their name.

The reality is this policy shift will make little practical difference in a war in which most every casualty has become nameless and faceless for most of the nation. But as Kirkpatrick's mother so poignantly made clear, those names and faces should be known to Americans.

The war in Afghanistan, which began in October 2001, has become barely noticed background noise for most citizens, whose lives remain untouched in any direct way by the conflict. And the delay in notification may make the war even more remote.

As Gen. Nicholson knows better than nearly anyone, it is important for Americans to hear Ã¢ÂÂ quickly and in a timely manner Ã¢ÂÂ of the losses their nation's fighting forces are sustaining.

It is important for those newly Gold Star families to know that their country is there for them, that it cares, that it understands the sacrifice and appreciates that some families are willing to incur unfathomable losses on behalf of their country.

What would make the biggest difference for grieving families is for Americans to sit up and pay attention to their wars and to mourn with Gold Star families once those losses are named and faces and photos are added to the stories about war casualties. This is because war is deeply personal, even if we don't write, talk or act like it in this country.

Beyond the policy changes on notification, America's disconnection from the Afghanistan war is about to be tested further as the Pentagon-led interagency review of the conflict launched by President Donald Trump finally draws to completion Ã¢ÂÂ several months later than expected. Among the issues being debated by those conducting the policy review: the number of troops, what kinds of troops and for how long would they remain committed to the Afghan theater.

Those close to the review expected an announcement in May, before that month's NATO summit. Indeed, in February, Defense Secretary James Mattis told reporters that ""it shouldn't take too long. I've got to integrate a fair number of issues to give a good recommendation for the way ahead.""

Three months later, Mattis said that the Afghanistan troop recommendation ""is being put together by the chairman and myself, and I expect it'll go to (a) decision very, very soon."" And in June, the defense secretary told Congress that he would be giving Trump his Afghanistan recommendation ""very soon.""

Recent reports suggest that Trump, who had previously said he would defer to his generals about troop levels, would cap the number of those sent to Afghanistan at 3,900 Ã¢ÂÂ at least without requiring military leaders to return to him for his approval.

This was a month after news reports appeared , asserting that ""the Pentagon will send almost 4,000 additional American forces to Afghanistan"" and nearly immediately generated a statement from the Pentagon denying any decision had been made.

Whenever the official troop announcement comes, it likely will be around the 3,900 mark. America must pay closer attention as those service members deploy and engage with its wars not from a distance, but as if the war had personal stakes.

For the sake of families like those of Pfc. Hansen Kirkpatrick and for the sake of the country that sent him to Afghanistan in the first place, America can no longer see these fights as sterile, nameless or faceless.

They are none of the above. Every one of those losses was a father, mother, sister, wife, friend and brother. And each one should matter Ã¢ÂÂ in real time Ã¢ÂÂ to the nation."

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-consumers-arbitration-idUSKBN19V28C?il=0,NEW RULE REQUIRES U.S. BANKS TO ALLOW CONSUMER CLASS ACTIONS,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. banks and credit card companies could be prevented from blocking customers from banding together to sue them under a rule released by the country's consumer finance agency on Monday. In releasing the rule, which goes into full effect in eight months, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fired the first shot in a likely brutal political battle between Republicans and Democrats over regulators' reach into banks' workings and customer rights. Banks blasted the rule, which bars financial firms from forcing customers to agree to settle disputes only through arbitration as a condition of opening new accounts, but consumer advocates said it will make sure wronged customers have their day in court. ""Mandatory arbitration"" clauses that block customers from filing or joining a class-action lawsuit appear in contracts for a wide variety of products. The rule was proposed last year under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat who appointed the current director of the CFPB, Richard Cordray. Republicans now control both Congress and the White House, and are already looking into stopping it in its tracks. Just before the CFPB unveiled the final rule, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika wrote Cordray to raise ""safety and soundness"" concerns with a draft version he had read and asked the CFPB to share data it used in crafting the rule, according to a copy of the letter obtained by Reuters.  The CFPB did not share the final rule with him ahead of the announcement, according to an Office of the Comptroller of the Currency spokesman. In the letter, Noreika, appointed by Republican President Donald Trump, cited a section of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that allows his office to set aside possibly unsafe CFPB rules. Eliminating mandatory arbitration ""could result in less effective consumer protection and remedies, while simply enriching class-action lawyers,"" he wrote, adding the rule ""may potentially decrease the products and services offered to consumers, while increasing their costs."" In the final rule, the bureau requires financial companies to give customers the option of arbitration or of banding together to sue in class actions. Companies must also provide redacted records of claims and awards reached through arbitration, which the CFPB will post on its website beginning in July 2019. Rule critics say class actions are costly, suck up time and result in lower awards for consumers. In recent months, they have worked to undo regulations barring the fine print from contracts for nursing-homes and for-profit colleges. Supporters say Americans have the right to take complaints to court, and group lawsuits are effective in publicly correcting bad corporate behavior. They say arbitrations are secretive and rigged in favor of companies. California may soon allow state residents to sue financial institutions after clauses inserted into Wells Fargo account-opening agreements blocked customers from suing over the bank's creation of unauthorized accounts in their names. Calling the new CFPB rule ""anti-consumer,"" the Republican chair of the House Financial Services Committee, Representative Jeb Hensarling said Congress should reject it under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), which gives lawmakers power to kill newly minted regulations. The Consumer Bankers Association has already begun lobbying lawmakers to use the CRA on the rule, said its president Richard Hunt.  Cordray, too, told reporters on a call he expects Congress to look into nullifying the rule but questioned the level of support for the move. Congress has already banned mandatory arbitration clauses for mortgages and contracts involving members of the military, he said.     Meanwhile, one of Washington's most powerful lobby groups and CFPB critics, the Chamber of Commerce, said it will ""consider every approach to address our concerns,"" which many interpreted as a threat to sue.

London (CNN) Nearly 15 years ago, while living in East London, I started taking my camera on all-day walks off the beaten track, visiting the city's little known -- and unexplored -- deserted wastelands.

Out of all the derelict places in London, none has fascinated me more than Silvertown, an isolated former industry hub east of the River Lea in the borough of Newham. Until recently, it was the only place in London that I could identify blindfolded due to the smell in the air -- a sweet sugar, or the dubious aromas of the few remaining industrial plants in the area.

When I first came across it, all that remained open were a small number of shops that had seen better days, and a little-used railway station, which eventually closed down in 2006. None of my friends in nearby Canning Town would venture over to Silvertown, thinking it too rough.

Wrought iron gates guard the entrance to Silvertown. The area is named after Samuel Winkworth Silver, who opened a waterproof clothing factory there in 1852.

Every now and then I would enjoy a drink in Cundy's Tavern, the last remaining pub, since closed and replaced by flats. Cundy's was hanging on in its final days, with slashed seats repaired with gaffer tape and hand-written signs advertising strippers. The handful of drinkers in there were always amiable and told me all the local gossip and stories about the area's thriving past. This motivated me to find out more.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/10/news/economy/tax-reform-deductions/index.html,THE DEDUCTIONS THAT MAY BE KILLED BY TAX REFORM,"Real tax reform remains a very big IF. But ... if ... Congress and the Trump administration slash rates and overhaul the tax code, most itemized deductions taxpayers can claim on their tax returns would probably go away.

Why? Because both the White House and House Republicans have proposed getting rid of them except those for mortgage interest and charitable contributions.

Such a change would affect the 30% of federal tax filers who today choose to itemize because their deductions combined exceed the value of their standard deduction (currently, $6,300 for single filers and $12,600 for joint filers).

The vast majority of households making more than $200,000 itemize. And high-income filers get the most value from itemized deductions.

Nevertheless, there's a notable number of itemizers farther down the income scale as well. The Tax Foundation found that itemizers include: 39% of those with adjusted gross incomes between $50,000 and $75,000; 56% of those with AGIs of $75,000 to $100,000, and close to 77% of filers making between $100,000 and $200,000.

Any tax reform the current Congress might pass could entail a big cut in rates and a larger standard deduction. Details are still not set.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said eliminating most itemized deductions would help ensure the rich don't get much, if any, of a net tax cut. But killing itemized deductions would affect a lot of filers in the middle and upper-middle income ranges, too.

Here are some key deductions that could get the ax.

State and local tax deduction

Itemizers are allowed to write off their state and local income taxes or general sales taxes, plus their property taxes. This is largest itemized deduction for all itemizers, who typically live in high-tax states such as New York and California.

There is, however, resistance to getting rid of this deduction from lawmakers in states most affected by it.

Medical expenses

Today you may deduct the amount of your medical expenses that exceed 10% of your adjusted gross income. That's a tough threshold for most people to meet in any given year. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that just 4% of households claim it and their average savings from it amount to less than $1,500 per return.

While tax reform proposals would get rid of this deduction, Republican bills in the House and Senate to repeal-and-replace Obamacare would preserve it and lower the threshold for eligibility.

Investment interest

While interest payments on personal debt (such as credit cards and car loans) are not deductible, interest paid on loans for income-producing investments is.

So getting rid of that deduction would affect anyone who, for instance, buys stocks on margin, according to Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.

Those who would not be affected are those who pay interest on loans to support their businesses. That would still be deductible as a business expense on Schedule C.

Miscellaneous expenses

This is a catch-all category that includes tax preparation fees and unreimbursed employee expenses such as union dues, travel for work or job-related courses. Also: expenses for income-generating hobbies and gambling losses, among others.

So, for instance, today you may be able to deduct the cost of that business trip your employer failed to cover. That option would disappear and you'd have to fight your boss for reimbursement.

But there's a catch to such deductions: Specific rules govern whether any given expense is eligible. And you can only deduct some of the eligible miscellaneous expenses to the extent that, combined, they exceed 2% of your AGI.

Others, such as gambling losses or casualty and theft losses from income-producing properties, are not subject to the 2% threshold."

(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Chef Ana RoÃÂ¡ has single-handedly elevated Slovenian gastronomy to the world stage, having spent the past 15 years cultivating a culinary treasure inside her family's humble inn and restaurant HiÃÂ¡a Franko

Hidden away in Kobarid, a tiny town in Slovenia's northwest Soca River Valley, the cozy, family-run restaurant has drawn visitors from all over the world -- not to mention attention from the global culinary community. Most notably, RoÃÂ¡ was named World's Best Female Chef 2017 by the World's 50 Best Restaurants awards

It might have something to do with her contemporary approach to Slovenian food.

Slovenian chef Ana Ros was named World's Best Female Chef 2017 by World's 50 Best Restaurants.

Unfamiliar with the country's cuisine?

Sandwiched between Italy to the west and Austria to the north, the Central European country tends to see a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean flavors -- think fresh cottage cheeses, rich olive oil, fresh bread, potatoes, trout, pasta and mutton.

""Slovenia is a melting pot of cultures, history and traditions,"" RoÃÂ¡ tells CNN. ""Within 30 miles, you experience high mountains and beautiful beaches. This is exactly what our food looks like, but it's very personal. I try to tell my story, and express how I am evolving, in each dish.""

While HiÃÂ¡a Franko tends to sweep up the awards, RoÃÂ¡ and her partner, sommelier Valter Kramar, also co-own a restaurant in the Slovenian capital of Ljubljana: Gostilna na Gradu. As a frequent visitor to the storybook-worthy city, she tells CNN about her favorite haunts for intimate dinners, bar bites, cool bistros and unforgettable dining experiences:

JB Restaurant

For a modern dinner with a side of old-world charm, RoÃÂ¡ points to JB Restaurant.

""Every country has 'The Chef.' In Slovenia, this is him. Chef Janez BratovÃÂ¾ is the father of modern Slovenian cuisine,"" says RoÃÂ¡. ""He was the first to manage to enter the San Pellegrino list a few years ago (in 2010) and be ranked among the top 100 restaurants in the world. I like his more classical interpretations because they show off very well the skills of the chef.""

Designed by famous Slovenian architect JoÃÂ¾e PleÃÂnik, the family-run restaurant sports stylish interiors within a 1920s-heritage building. The cuisine takes its cues from the Mediterranean, with a heavy emphasis on fresh fish, game dishes, Ljubljana cottage cheese -- not to mention a long Slovenian wine list.

JB Restaurant , Janez BratovÃÂ¾ s.p., MikloÃÂ¡iÃÂeva 19, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; +386 1 430 70 70

Strelec Restaurant

Restaurant Strelec is built in a tower of Ljubljana Castle and offers an outside terrace with views over the city and countryside.

For a regal dining experience, this is the place. A circular room, Strelec Restaurant is built into the Ljubljana Castle archer tower and provides 360-degree views of the city. While the decor seems to embrace a medieval theme, it's not kitschy -- picture fur throws, stone walls, wall tapestries and a spiral staircase.

The avant-garde dishes are unconventional as well, designed in collaboration with an ethnologist to trace Slovenia's history.

Chef Igor Jagodic brings Slovenian history to life in his ever-changing tasting menus, which usually (but not always) feature signatures, such as potato with yolk and truffles, frog legs, or Danube salmon with Jerusalem artichokes.

""The menu always changes,"" says RoÃÂ¡. ""One of the most ambitious and skilled Slovenian chefs, the chef is shy in his private life, but very ambitious when it comes to his work.""

Strelec Restaurant , Grajska planota 1, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; +386 31 687 648

Gostilna na Gradu

When exploring the leafy grounds of Ljubljana Castle, atop a hill overlooking the city, it's impossible to pass by Gostilna na Gradu. With its alfresco deck and cavern-like interiors, the restaurant looks like the perfect place to sip on crisp Slovenian wine and while away an afternoon.

""This is our restaurant in the capital,"" says RoÃÂ¡. ""My husband, Valter Kramar, and I opened the place in partnership with chef Svetozar Raspopovic-Pope, wanting to create a restaurant where you can taste all of Slovenia in one spot.

""We delegated chef Damjan Fink to helm the kitchen. He used to work for me for some years. One day, he'll take over the place.""

On the menu? Fresh and aged Tolmin cheese, Kranjska Gora sausage (from a northwestern Alpine region), comforting nettle-filled ravioli, beef tongue with parsnip and a traditional barley stew.

Gostilna na Gradu , Grajska planota 1, 1000 Ljubljana; +386 8 205 19 30

Monstera Bistro

A casual-cool new bistro on a pretty pedestrian street, Monstera Bistro is helmed by Bine VolÃÂiÃÂ, a Le Cordon Bleu-trained chef. The small dining area feels clean yet industrial -- all white and gray, with exposed piping, concrete and bricks. An open kitchen provides a look at how the sausage is made -- sometimes literally -- and the coffee and wine bar makes it easy to enjoy a quick one.

""It's one of the newest arrivals in the city (opened in 2016). It's young, fresh and reminds me of my favorite Paris bistro, Clamato,"" says RoÃÂ¡. ""The black pudding with langoustines is simply perfect.""

The ever-changing set menus follow the seasons, using local ingredients as a rule. While the food might change, biodynamic Slovenian wines and home-brewed Lila MiSa craft beer are always close at hand.

Monstera Bistro , Gosposka ulica 9, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; +386 40 431 123

Gostilna SkaruÃÂna

Gostilna SkaruÃÂna is an energetic, Bohemian place outside Ljubljana.

About 15 minutes into the countryside outside the capital, Gostilna SkaruÃÂna has a reputation for its boisterous dinners and eclectic surrounds.

""This is one of the craziest places on Earth that you can imagine,"" says RoÃÂ¡. ""It is a 'one and only' kind of experience. It's run by a crazy father and a crazier son. They have great traditional food, a fantastic organic wine list, and unconventional music.""

What's so crazy about it? It comes down to the gregarious owner, Slavko ÃÂ½agar Jr.

ÃÂ½agar inherited the restaurant from his mustachioed father about 15 years ago, and still drives the same beat-up Yugoslavian car around the Slovenian countryside to collect his meat and produce -- everything from cottage cheese to pumpkin oil, trout and beef tongue. The eclectic Bohemian decor adds to the anything-goes energy, with vintage typewriters, vinyl records and memorabilia cluttering every inch of the antique furniture.

""You can spend hours at the table here, and then it really starts when the cviÃÂek (a light red wine from the southwestern Slovenia) and spirits come out.""

Gostilna SkaruÃÂna , SkaruÃÂna 20, 1217 Vodice, Slovenia; +386 1 832 30 80

Sushimama

Japanese food might not be your top pick when dining out in Slovenia, but it's hard to argue with the menu at Sushimama. In addition to the obvious sushi and sashimi, there's Kobe-style wagyu beef carpaccio, scorpion fish nigiri, shrimp tempura, miso crab soup, Alaskan black cod... see what we mean?

""This is the best sushi in town,"" says RoÃÂ¡. ""The decor is clean and contemporary, and they're in love with good ingredients. The atmosphere is really peaceful and quiet ... until my family enters. My son seemingly holds the restaurant record for the highest number of sushi eaten in one evening.""

Sushimama , Wolfova ulica 12, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; +386 40 702 070

Stelec chef Igor Jagodic's signature dishes include potato with yolk and truffles, frog legs, or Danube salmon with Jerusalem artichokes.

Pop's Place

There's really never a night that Pop's Place isn't popping. The enormous pub has several outdoor seating areas -- one in a cobblestone courtyard, the other by the river -- and ample space inside as well.

The specialty here? Burgers and craft beer. Run by a Slovenian who grew up in the United States, the gastropub draws a crowd day and night.

The burgers are made with locally sourced beef which has been blended and aged in house. But if beef isn't your thing, the chicken sandwiches, BBQ ribs and sweet potato fries also come highly recommended.

""I often go here and dine alone, but I never feel alone. It has such a great young, loud atmosphere,"" says RoÃÂ¡. ""The place invites people to relax and leave all their concerns at the door."""
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-idUSKBN19U0CT?il=0,IRAQI PRIME MINISTER CONGRATULATES ARMED FORCES FOR MOSUL 'VICTORY',"MOSUL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi arrived in Mosul on Sunday and congratulated the armed forces for their ""victory"" over Islamic State after nearly nine months of urban warfare, bringing an end to jihadist rule in the city.  Islamic State's defeat in Mosul three years after taking the city is a major blow for the hardline Sunni Islamist group, which is also losing ground in its operational base in the Syrian city of Raqqa from where it has planned global attacks. The group, however, still controls territory in Iraq and is expected to revert to more conventional insurgent tactics such as bombings as its self-proclaimed caliphate falls apart. The battle for Mosul - by far the largest city to fall under the militants' control - has left large areas in ruins, killed thousands of civilians and displaced nearly 1 million people. ""The commander in chief of the armed forces (Prime Minister) Haider al-Abadi arrived in the liberated city of Mosul and congratulated the heroic fighters and Iraqi people for the great victory,"" his office said in a statement. State television later showed Abadi touring Mosul on foot alongside residents of Iraq's second-largest city.  Air strikes and exchanges of gunfire could still be heard in the narrow streets of Mosul's Old City, where the group has staged its last stand against Iraqi forces backed by a U.S.-led international coalition. Abadi met commanders in west Mosul who led the battle, but he has yet to issue a formal declaration that the entire city has been retaken from the group which is also known as ISIS. Abadi's spokesman, Saad al-Hadithi, said victory would not be formally declared until the few remaining Islamic State militants were cleared from Mosul. Still, France and Britain, members of the coalition that has conducted air strikes and provided training and assistance to Iraqi forces on the battlefield, welcomed the defeat. ""Mosul liberated from ISIS: France pays homage to all those, who alongside our troops, contributed to this victory,"" French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted. ""I congratulate Prime Minister Abadi, and the Iraqi forces who have been fighting on the ground with great bravery and care against a brutal opponent,"" British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said in a statement. While celebrating ""the removal of the death cult from Mosul"", Fallon said the military operation was not over. ""This barbaric group remains dug in west of the Euphrates and clearing operations in and around Mosul will be needed because of the threat from improvised explosive devices.""     In Washington, National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton, when asked whether the battle for Mosul was complete, replied: ""Situation not resolved, but we are monitoring."" Iraq still faces uncertainty and long-term stability will be possible only if the government contains ethnic and sectarian tensions which have dogged the country since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003. The fall of Mosul exposes fractures between Arabs and Kurds over disputed territories, and between Sunnis and the Shiite majority.        The group vowed to ""fight to the death"" in Mosul, but Iraqi military spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Rasool told state TV that 30 militants had been killed attempting to flee by swimming across the River Tigris that bisects the city.     Cornered in a shrinking area, the militants resorted to sending women suicide bombers among the thousands of civilians who are emerging from the battlefield wounded, malnourished and fearful, Iraqi army officers said. The struggle has also exacted a heavy toll on Iraq's security forces.  The Iraqi government does not reveal casualty figures, but a funding request from the U.S. Department of Defense said the elite Counter Terrorism Service (CTS), which has spearheaded the fight in Mosul, had suffered 40 percent losses.         The Department of Defense has requested $1.269 billion in U.S. budget funds for 2018 to continue supporting Iraqi forces, which collapsed in the face of the few hundred militants who overran Mosul in 2014. Backed by coalition air strikes, an array of Iraqi forces gradually clawed back territory from Islamic State until reaching Mosul, the group's de facto capital in Iraq, last October.     It is almost exactly three years since the ultra-hardline group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, proclaimed a ""caliphate"" spanning Syria and Iraq from the pulpit of Mosul's medieval Grand al-Nuri mosque.     Abadi declared the end of Islamic State's ""state of falsehood"" a week ago, after security forces retook the mosque - although only after retreating militants blew it up.     The United Nations predicts it will cost more than $1 billion to repair basic infrastructure in Mosul. In some of the worst affected areas, almost no buildings appear to have escaped damage and Mosul's dense construction means the extent of the devastation might be underestimated, U.N. officials said.

http://cnn.com/travel/article/brazil-best-beaches/index.html,8 OF BRAZIL'S BEST BEACHES - CNN.COM,"Joe Robinson, for CNN Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Updated 7th July 2017

(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Brazil and beaches go together like bossa nova and ""The Girl From Ipanema,"" which, of course, put the country on the map as a hub of sun and sand and the eternally tanned and lovely.

With 4,650 miles of mostly tropical coastline, Brazil can lay claim to one of the biggest collections of balmy shores on the planet, little of it known outside the largest country in South America. Look at what you get:

-- Seafronts piled high with dunes and pocked with turquoise pools in the northeast states of Maranao and Rio Grande do Norte.

-- The rugged shores of Bahia.

-- Secluded coves on the southern island of Santa Catarina.

Brazil's best beaches make the place a shore lover's nirvana. Brazilians take their coastal assets seriously, and beach culture is a big part of the lifestyle.

Beachgoers in Rio de Janeiro have been known to break into applause as the sun sets after a particularly fine day of bronzing. Yes, Rio has its share of world-class city beaches, but Brazil's best beaches, the ones that get you away from it all, are found elsewhere.

There are dozens of breathtaking stretches of golden sand up and down the long coast of Brazil.

Given that distances are vast and infrastructure not always on the same page you are, let's narrow the list down to Brazil's best eight beaches that you're most likely to get to without a trekking guide.

1. Ipanema, Zona Sul, Rio de Janeiro

Most travelers will see their first beaches in Rio, which does have some remarkable, if crowded shores. Of the famed Zona Sul beaches, Ipanema is a classic choice.

If it's not too crowded, it's a beautiful stretch of sand, with kiosks to pick up a coconut to down the water from the shell or a caipirinha. There's plenty of scenery along the sand and the jagged pinnacles of the Two Brothers that loom up beyond the next beach, Leblon.

A couple blocks from the water, you can revisit the inspiration for the ""Girl From Ipanema"" with a visit to Garota de Ipanema, the cafe where the song was written.

If your tastes run to fewer tourists, more nature, Arpoador Beach is hidden by the rocky bluffs separating Copacabana from Ipanema. It's an isolated cove with wild waves and (relative) peace in the middle of chaos.

2. Praia dos Carneiros, Pernambuco

About an hour south of Recife, Tamandare is an unpretentious beach town with a shore you can wander for miles and explore nearby wetlands. A couple miles from town, you'll find one of the most idyllic coastal stretches in Brazil.

Tucked into a grove of palms off a dirt road, Praia dos Carneiros looks like it escaped from a South Seas postcard. The white sand beach faces a small, lagoon-style bay that's great for swimming. The water is bathtub-warm, and there are no waves to contend with. Leaning, long-frond palms form a picturesque colonnade down the shoreline.

Watercraft are available for rent, and boat tours of the bay and wetlands are a great way to get to know the area.

Carneiros's superb natural setting is perfect for a quiet, not chaotic, day at the beach. The secret to the tranquility is that Carneiros is a private beach. It and the area around it are owned by a single family, which has managed to keep it from being overrun. It's not cheap -- $30 a day per car, and the only on-site food is also pricey, but the serenity and scenery are worth it.

A day at one of Brazil's best beaches doesn't get much more relaxing than this.

3. Caraiva, Bahia

With almost 700 miles of coastline, and smack in the tropical zone, the state of Bahia is loaded with fishing villages and spectacular beaches. One of the best is Caraiva, a hidden beauty 30 miles south of Bahia's best-known beach site, Porto Seguro.

There are no vehicles in Caraiva other than the four-legged kind, so the roar you hear is the crashing of waves or mules. It wasn't that long ago the town didn't even have electricity. The beach here goes on for hours, verdant headlands on one side, azure sea on the other.

Though there isn't a lot of commerce around, you can eat tasty seafood, and the trusty mules make sure you're stocked with beverages. There's a ""lost in time"" quality about Caraiva, but with beaches this exquisite, that won't last for long.

4. Taipus de Fora, Bahia

Few colors have the power of translucent turquoise to stop humans in their tracks. Taipus de Fora has enough of the hue to keep the most jaded traveler enchanted.

Located on the sea side of the Marau Peninsula on the south coast of Bahia, this beach is a snorkeler's dream. As the tide ebbs, it leaves behind brilliant, turquoise reef pools perfect for viewing an assortment of colorful tropical fish. No need for Photoshop here. That turquoise is the real deal. The beach itself runs broad and golden for some four miles, with thick, luscious palms.

You won't have trouble finding a reasonably priced place to stay, with accommodations from hotels to pousadas to rental houses and campgrounds, or a bar to imbibe near a reef pool.

5. Porto da Barra, Salvador, Bahia

In many ways, Porto da Barra is to Salvador (capital of the state of Bahia) what Bondi is to Sydney and Venice Beach is to Los Angeles.

Tiny fishing boats bring in the day's catch, there's beach volleyball and plenty to see at the Fisherman Colony Manguinhos, a traditional fish market in Buizos. This is one of the few beaches in the lively city of Salvador that faces west, so you can catch great sunsets.

6. Praia da Pipa, Rio Grande do Norte

A backwater fishing village until backpackers discovered it in the 1970s, Praia da Pipa is a favorite weekend retreat for locals in nearby large cities such as Recife and a respected northeast Brazil stop for global travelers as well. A number of international visitors came here and never left, staying on to run small pousadas or restaurants.

The attractions are obvious -- a beautiful natural setting, with steep pink cliffs rising above the sand and remnants of the great Atlantic Forest that once draped this coast still alive and verdant.

There's plenty to do: surfing, dolphin-watching, sand-boarding. At night, Pipa village is packed with cafes and bars where you can meet and greet and knock back caipirinhas.

7. Praia do Sancho, Fernando de Noronha, Pernambuco

Often voted Brazil's best beach, Praia do Sancho is a bay on the island of Fernando de Noronha, facing the coast of Brazil rather than out into the Atlantic Ocean. Covered in vegetation, its steep, rocky cliffs form a backdrop to clear waters that are accessible only via ladders attached to the cliff face or by boat.

8. Porto de Galinhas, Pernambuco

The most respected major tourist beach in Brazil is Porto de Galinas, about 45 minutes south of Recife. Its lower-key, more eco-centric approach attracts fans on both the independent and mass travel side. The beach is a perennial winner of the ""best beach in Brazil"" award by readers of ""Viagem e Turismo"" (""Travel and Tourism""), a popular Brazilian travel magazine.

A former fishing village, Porto de Galinhas is famed for its crystalline reef pools, which make for great snorkeling and swimming. Small sailboats (jangadas) take you out to explore the pools, though the most treasured of the pools, which resembles a map of Brazil, is protected and off-limits."

He was captured Friday in Texas with more than $47,000 in cash on him

(CNN) A South Carolina prisoner broke out of prison using a cell phone, a makeshift dummy, a drone and wire cutters, the South Carolina Department of Corrections said Friday.

The prisoner, Jimmy Causey, 46, was apprehended at a Texas hotel around 3 a.m. ET Friday after South Carolina authorities notified police in Texas, according to South Carolina Law Enforcement Division Chief Mark Keel.

Causey had a semi-automatic pistol, a pump shotgun, $47,654 in cash and four cell phones on him at the time of his capture, Keel said.

Causey escaped from Lieber Correctional Institution, a maximum-security prison in Ridgeville, South Carolina, about 8 p.m. Tuesday, said Bryan Stirling, director of the corrections department.

He had previously escaped from a prison in Columbia in 2005 and was caught three days later.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/07/health/turning-points-john-mcelroy/index.html,THE UNLIKELY NURSE: FROM BRICK MAKER TO RN,"(CNN) Registered nurse John McElroy is living his dream Ã¢ÂÂ one made of hospital scrubs, overnight shifts and patients facing difficult recoveries.

This husband and father of three works in a rehabilitation ward at St. Helens and Knowsley Teaching Hospital in St. Helens, England.

""When I was younger I always wanted to be a nurse,"" he tells CNN.

Yet, McElroy's journey into medicine was unusual Ã¢ÂÂ it didn't begin until his 44th birthday.

""I worked in a local brick factory for about twenty-five years,"" he recalls.

It was a physically demanding job,"" he says. ""Life in the factory was quite tough.""

It was about to get a lot tougher.

Not just a headache

In March of 2007, McElroy suffered what he thought was a mild headache.

He was out for drinks with friends at a local pub when a dizzy spell hit. He stumbled home, fell asleep and woke the next morning with even worse dizziness.

""The world was spinning like 500 miles an hour,"" he recalls. ""It was as if something inside my head had just exploded.""

McElroy's daughter and wife called an ambulance and rushed him to the hospital. After five days of testing, scans revealed the problem Ã¢ÂÂ a stroke.

He lost sight in his right eye and words persistently failed him.

""I was speaking but the words Ã¢ÂÂ it was just jibberish. That was scary,"" he says.

But the worst part, McElroy recalls, was the short temper he suddenly possessed. Doctors had warned that his stroke could cause personality changes. His wife was often on the receiving end of the new ""heightened agitation.""

""I knew that I was different and it was like, 'Why am I behaving like this?' "" he explains.

His wife's support during the darkest moments following the stroke played a vital role in his recovery and further deepened the couple's love, he says.

""Without my wife's support, I probably would have gone into a downward spiral.""

With lingering dizziness, balance and coordination issues, McElroy soon lost his job. His confidence was shattered.

""Although my wife was working we were struggling financially,"" he says. ""I was thinking I'm not ready for the scrapheap. I am too young.""

A conversation with destiny

Nurse John McElroy says he understands how his patients feel after spending 18 months recovering from a stroke.

When McElroy hit ""rock bottom,"" a chance meeting with a nurse during a hospital visit rekindled his childhood dream of working in medicine, he says.

""She said, 'You would make a fantastic nurse,' "" he said.

The nurse gave him a piece of advice he would forever remember.

""(She said) you will have loads of excuses to not do this, to fail, to quit. But you've got to carry on.""

A new start

Motivated by the nurse's advice, McElroy began taking steps to begin a medical career. He enrolled in a local college, but soon discovered that learning while recovering from a brain injury would not be easy.

""I can't tell you how many times I sort of wanted to stop. I said, 'I just can't do this,' "" he recalls.

""I always wanted to be a nurse,"" says John McEloy.

Despite the odds, and with the support of friends and family, McElroy didn't give up.

After successfully completing his prerequisite courses, the former brick maker was accepted into a fast-track nursing program at a university. There he found out he had a learning disability called acquired dyslexia.

At the university, he received help from a learning facilitator who served as his ""memory bank"" by coaching him through assignments, McElroy said.

McElroy was awarded about $4,000 in scholarship money to complete his studies. In 2012 he achieved his childhood dream, graduating with his nursing degree.

Where hope meets medicine

Today, McElroy works alongside two nurses who once cared for him. Most of his patients have brain or spinal problems.

McElroy often uses his story to encourage patients like John Hargreaves.

""He's a good listener,"" Hargreaves says. ""He tells what happened to him and It inspires me to work harder.""

Each day McElroy sees pieces of his own journey reflected in his patients. He educates families on the unique needs of stoke survivors.

He hopes by sharing his personal story, his patients will believe that there is life after recovery.

""I hope people can know that it's not the end of the world,"" he says. ""There is light at the end of the tunnel."""

Not much is left before our forces reach the river.""Iraqi officials have made similar pronouncements over the past week as security forces have bottled the militants up in a sliver of the Old City along the Tigris River. But the troops' progress has slowed in recent days.The militants hold less than one square kilometer (mile) of territory, but are using civilians as human shields, making it nearly impossible for U.S.-led warplanes to flush them out.On Saturday the militarized Federal Police announced that they had cleared their assigned sector, while the regular army and special forces continued to battle the extremists. Some units remain up to 150 meters (yards) from the river.The operation to retake Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, began in October. The battle for the Old City, with its narrow alleyways and dense population, has been among the most brutal of the offensive.IS seized Mosul in the summer of 2014 when it swept across northern and central Iraq. That summer the group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, made his first and only public appearance at the al-Nuri mosque in Mosul's Old City. The militants destroyed the mosque and its famed minaret as Iraqi forces closed in last month."

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners have been trying to reduce a global crude glut with production cuts. OPEC states and 11 other exporters agreed in May to extend cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until March. However, Nigeria and Libya, OPEC members exempt from the cuts, have raised output. Iran was allowed a small increase to recover market share lost under Western sanctions. It said its production has surpassed 3.8 million bpd and is expected to reach 4 million bpd by March. U.S. shale oil output is up around 10 percent since last year, with the number of U.S. oil rigs in operation at the  highest in more than three years.  U.S. production could jump to 10, maybe 10.5 million barrels a day by the end of the year, and when you add Libya, Nigeria and North Sea production, that will negate the Saudi-led cuts,"" said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. ""Were looking to make a run at the 40 dollar market.""  Analysts at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said demand had not grown quickly enough to absorb excess output.

Demonstration began after an opposition MP was imprisoned

Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) Turkish citizens arrived en masse in Istanbul on Sunday, after marching 250 miles over three-and-a-half weeks to demand the government loosen its stranglehold on the country's democracy.

Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), finished the last kilometer of his long trek alone and was met with huge applause and chants of ""Rights! Law! Justice!"" as he entered Maltepe Square.

The square was packed to its seams and many attendees and marchers gave up trying to enter the rally, instead joining in on the chants from grassy patches outside the square.

""We need justice and democracy. That's why we have been in the roads for days,"" said Fadime ÃÂzbudak, a 47-year-old housewife. ""It's wonderful here. I couldn't even get inside, but I'm just so happy. ... I've never seen anything like this in Turkey.""

The announcement followed months of speculation that Abercrombie might be acquired by Express Inc. or American Eagle Outfitters Inc.In leaving the bargaining table, Abercrombie has few easy options. The retailer was a mainstay of shopping malls and college fashion in the 90s and early 2000s, but its lost much of its allure. The company also has been hit hard by a broader slowdown in mall traffic and the shift of shopping online.Chairman Arthur Martinez pledged sound, aggressive action to enhance shareholder value over the long term, according to a statement. The company pointed to solid comparable sales at its Hollister business and said its following through on measures to position the Abercrombie brand for revitalized performance.In May, Express and American Eagle Outfitters were said to be discussing a takeover of the company and news of the deal caused shares to jump at the time. The companys stock had risen 1.3 percent this year through Fridays close, trailing the 8.3 percent gain in the Standard & Poors 500 Index.The retail industry has been shaken by bankruptcies and a rising tide of store closures this year as consumer preferences also shift to spend on experiences such as food and travel instead of physical goods.Abercrombie didnt disclose details on any proposed deals and said it wouldnt comment further on the discussions.The announcement comes five months after the retailer promoted Fran Horowitz from president to chief executive officer, finally filling the open job more than two years after longtime leader Mike Jeffries departed. Horowitz was long seen as the next leader of the struggling teen company, which has tried to broaden its appeal beyond preppy shoppers.As part of its efforts to reach new customers, the company has revived its intimates brand and added products to its storefront windows while dialing back music volume and use of scents in stores.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-g20-germany-trump-xi-idUSKBN19T0SP,TRUMP KEEPS IT FRIENDLY WITH XI AT G20 ON NORTH KOREA THREAT,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump took a conciliatory tone on Saturday at a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping where the leaders agreed to keep working on two pressing issues: the nuclear threat posed by North Korea and bilateral trade irritants. Trump campaigned in last year's presidential election on cracking down on China for its trade practices, but he softened his rhetoric after taking office, saying he wanted to work with China on the nuclear issue. When the two leaders first met in April at Trump's Florida resort, they appeared to hit it off. Trump called Xi a ""good man"" as he urged him to use Beijing's economic clout to force North Korea to curb its nuclear weapons program. Lately, Trump has expressed some impatience on China's role in North Korea - particularly after Pyongyang launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that some experts believe could have the range to reach Alaska, and parts of the U.S. West Coast. His administration made new arms sales to Taiwan, imposed sanctions on two Chinese citizens and a shipping company and put China on a global human trafficking list. It also accused a Chinese bank of laundering money for Pyongyang. The White House is also debating trade actions against Beijing, including tariffs on its steel exports and a few days before the G20 talks, Trump complained that trade between China and North Korea had grown.  But he showed none of that impatience on Saturday, when the leaders met at the invitation of Xi at the tail end of the G20 in Germany. ""It's an honor to have you as a friend,"" Trump told Xi, telling him he appreciated actions he had already taken on North Korea. ""As far as North Korea is concerned, we will have, eventually, success. It may take longer than I'd like. It may take longer than you'd like. But there will be success in the end one way or the other,"" Trump said. Speaking to reporters later on Air Force One, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the Trump-Xi meeting lasted over an hour-and-a-half, and they had ""substantive discussions"" about how to deal with North Korea together. ""In regards to China, we had very direct discussions about North Korea. We had very direct discussions about military and security cooperation,"" Mnuchin said.   ""I think that President Trump made very clear to President Xi that he is focused on this issue, and wants to move forward and make progress. And I think President Xi gave a very interesting perspective from their standpoint,"" he added.    For his part, Xi told Trump that stronger China-U.S. ties were conducive to stability and prosperity amid global conflicts, and had made ""new progress"" in some areas ""despite some sensitive issues"", Xi said, according to state news agency Xinhua. Xi stressed the importance of talks with North Korea, and said China's navy will join next year's U.S.-led Pacific Rim military exercises. Xinhua said Xi stressed to Trump China's position that it adheres to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and maintaining peace and stability there. While China has been angered by North Korea's repeated nuclear and missile tests, it also blames the United States and South Korea for worsening tension with their military exercises. ""China has many times talked about its principled position, namely that at the same time as the international community making necessary responses to North Korean acts that go against U.N. Security Council resolutions, they must step up efforts to promote talks and manage and control the situation,"" Xinhua said, citing Xi. Xi also reiterated China's opposition to the U.S. deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system in South Korea, Xinhua said. China says THAAD threatens its security, despite U.S. and South Korean assurances it is aimed only at defending against North Korea. Both leaders agreed to maintain close communication and coordination on the Korean peninsula nuclear issue, Xinhua said. In a statement released on Sunday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Xi and Trump had ""enhanced mutual understanding"" about the North Korea issue and ""confirmed the broad direction of using peaceful means to resolve this issue"". Trump also mentioned trade imbalances in his meeting with Xi, calling it a ""very, very big issue"" that he would address. ""I know that China in particular, which is a great trading partner, we will be able to do something that will be equitable and reciprocal,"" Trump said. Senior officials from both countries will meet in Washington on July 19 to discuss economic and trade issues.

A federal judge granted preliminary approval over the weekend for Wells Fargo's $142 million national class action settlement. The court ruled that the settlement, which covers fake accounts back to 2002, ""fair, reasonable and adequate.""

Victims may still have to wait before they get paid. The bank and lawyers for the plaintiffs plan to reach out to customers in the next three months, but the settlement may not be final until early 2018.

Still, Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan called the court ruling a ""major milestone in our efforts to make things right for our customers.""

Wells Fargo admitted last September that 2 million potentially unauthorized checking and credit card accounts were opened between 2011 and 2015. The bank blamed unrealistic sales goals. The outrage forced the ouster of longtime CEO John Stumpf and the restructuring of Wells Fargo's sales targets, and it spawned federal and local investigations.

Related: Elizabeth Warren wants the Wells Fargo board wiped out

Under an original settlement with regulators in September, Wells Fargo repaid $3.26 million in fees to wronged customers. Since then, the bank has paid $1.8 million more to cover complaints from customers about fake accounts.

The $142 million national settlement is open to customers who claim that Wells Fargo improperly opened checking or savings accounts, credit cards, lines of credit or identity theft services in their names between 2002 and April 2017.

Wells Fargo has also offered to compensate some customers whose credit scores suffered because credit card accounts were secretly opened in their names.

Derek Loeser, a partner at the law firm Keller Rohrback and lead attorney for the plaintiffs, hailed this feature of the settlement as ""groundbreaking"" and ""first-of-its kind.""

The settlement is an important step toward ""holding Wells Fargo accountable for its abuse of customers' trust,"" Loeser said in a statement.

Related: New Wells Fargo scandal over modifying mortgages without consent

The amount that each wronged Wells Fargo customer will receive will vary based on how many fake accounts were opened in their name, how big a financial hit they took and how much money is left in the settlement pool.

The $142 million will first go to lawyer fees and administrative costs. Then Wells Fargo customers will be paid for out-of-pocket losses, such as fees from fake accounts. What's left will be split among all customers, based on how many and what kind of accounts they say were opened.

Wells Fargo has agreed to strengthen the deal: The initial settlement, announced in late March, was worth $110 million. That amount was raised to $142 million in April to expand the settlement to 2002. Wells Fargo's board recently released a report that found evidence of fake accounts going back to ""at least"" that year.

Wells Fargo has agreed to put more money in the settlement fund if less than $25 million is left for wronged customers after paying the lawyers, expenses and out-of-pocket costs.

Customers who believe they were victims don't need to take action yet to be included. More information is available at www.wfsettlement.com, and Wells Fargo has established a hotline at 1-877-924-8697.

A hearing for the court to grant final approval is scheduled for January 4."

The Japanese automaker said the incident occurred in Florida in June 2016 when an individual was working on repairs on a 2001 Honda Accord and the air bag ruptured. At least 17 deaths and 180 injuries worldwide are now tied to the defect that prompted the largest ever auto safety recall and led Takata to file for bankruptcy protection last month. Takata inflators can explode with excessive force, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks The Honda Accord was among a group of more than 300,000 unrepaired recalled Honda vehicles equipped with inflators with a substantial risk of rupturing. Honda said the vehicle's registered owners had received at least 12 recall notices but never got recommended repairs. The individual working on the vehicle in Florida died a day after sustaining injuries when the air bag deployed. Last year, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) urged owners to stop driving the ""unsafe"" cars until they were fixed. NHTSA said 2001-2003 model Honda and Acura vehicles have as high as a 50 percent chance of a dangerous air bag inflator rupture in a crash. Of the deaths linked to Takata's inflators, 16 took place in Honda vehicles since May 2009, including five in Malaysia using a different type Takata inflator, while one death occurred in a Ford Motor Co (F.N) vehicle in South Carolina in December 2015. Separately, a federal judge in Detroit on Monday said he planned to name law professor Eric D. Green to oversee $975 million in compensation funds for Takata air bag victims and automakers. Green, who teaches at Harvard, has served as a mediator in many major cases, including the U.S. Microsoft antitrust case, and currently serves as a Justice Department monitor overseeing the implementation of billions of dollars in consumer relief linked to settlements with banks stemming from the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Scott Caudill, chief operating officer of TK Holdings, Takata's U.S. unit, said in a court affidavit last month in its bankruptcy filing that the company ""faces insurmountable claims"" relating to the recalls and owes billions of dollars to automakers. He disclosed that Takata has recalled, or expects to recall, by 2019 about 125 million vehicles worldwide, including more than 60 million in the United States.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-budget-idUSKBN19V1ME?il=0,FRANCE ROWS BACK ON TAX CUT DELAY AS LABOR REFORM DEBATE OPENS,"PARIS (Reuters) - The French government will push ahead with tax cuts promised by President Emmanuel Macron, sources said on Monday, rowing back on comments from the prime minister that some could wait. The cuts are a key plank of Macron's economy-boosting reforms, but their timing was thrown into doubt last week when Prime Minister Edouard Philippe suggested the government could not afford to launch them as soon as next year.  Confirmation they will go ahead next year came on the day the debate opened in parliament on another of his main policy measures, pro-business labor reforms. ""The president and the prime minister's objective is for tax measures to be undertaken in the 2018 budget bill to trigger a supply-side shock and boost confidence,"" a source in Philippe's office said. ""To do this, the government is studying solutions to step up tax cuts starting from 2018, especially on property taxes and the wealth taxes,"" the source said, adding the government still aimed to meet an EU deficit target. French business leaders had bridled at the proposed delay to the tax measures, warning that the country needs urgent to reduce the tax burden in order to restore competitiveness. Also facing criticism over the delay from a number of economists, Philippe made a phone call late on Saturday night to set up an emergency meeting with Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire and with Macron to review the tax cut timing, a finance ministry source said. Le Maire then hinted at a business conference on Sunday that the timing was once more under review. During the meeting itself, Macron insisted that the plans to rein in France's wealth tax and scrap local property taxes for 80 percent of those who pay them should after all begin to take effect in 2018, the source said. A delay was raised after the public audit office said a budget shortfall left by former president Francois Hollande's government would result in a deficit of 3.2 percent of national output this year compared with the Hollande government's forecast of 2.8 percent. Macron has promised to meet the EU's three percent target in 2017, in what would be the first time in a decade France falls in line with the European deficit ceiling. To meet the deficit target this year, the government is scrambling to come up with four to five billion euros in budget savings. The situation will only get more difficult next year, and     Macron's pledges to cut local property taxes and limit the scope of the wealth tax to property could put a strain on revenues in the years ahead. Les Echos newspaper said that reining in wealth and property taxes next year would cost about six billion euros. The finance ministry declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The paper said that that would come on top of seven billion in tax cuts already budgeted by the previous government, which Philippe confirmed over the weekend would be maintained. Offering some relief to the government is the growing chance that economic growth will be stronger this year than the 1.5 percent that the budget is based on.

And their numbers grew by almost 150,000 last year, halving the decline in number of people living in the nation.The biggest population of foreigners, known universally in Japan as ""gaijin,"" was in Tokyo. The 486,346 foreign residents in the capital now account for 4 percent of its population, up from 3 percent in 2013.The smallest number of foreigners is in northern Akita, famous for rice and snow. Only 3,637 foreigners, comprising just 0.35 percent of the population, were living there as of Jan. 1.And while Japan is one of the most aged societies in the world, thats not true of non-Japanese living in the country. Ninety-three percent of them are under 65, compared to only 73 percent of Japanese.However, unless theres a massive expansion of immigration or a change in birthrates, even increases in foreign residents at the current level wont be enough to stop or reverse the demographic decline. "

According to the story, Harris Associates, parent of Oakmark Funds, and Davis Funds both substantially increased their stakes in Apache during the first quarter, betting the stock could reach double its current $45 per share price. Apache's stock price fell 1.44 percent on Friday after the company announced plans to spin-off subsidiary Apache Canada Ltd to Paramount Resources, exiting the Canadian energy market. For the full week, the stock lost almost 6.0 percent, falling to near a 1-1/2-year low on Friday.  Apache reported profit in the first three months of 2017 with revenues up by almost $800 million and is expected to return to profitability this year after three years of losses. Analysts expect the company will earn $462 million on a GAAP basis, or $1.52 a share, on revenue of $6.6 billion this year, climbing next year to $2.04 a share on revenue of $7.4 billion, Barron's reported. Bullish investors cited Apache's resources in Permian Basin as well as Egypt and the North Sea, its movement of gas from its Alpine High oil field two months ahead of schedule, and reduction of costs as reasons for an expected jump in Apache's share price. ""We believe value will ultimately be realized, either by the market or by a buyer, Tony Coniaris, a manager of the Oakmark Select fund, told Barron's.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/06/health/photoshopped-baby-picture-with-piercing-trnd/index.html,PHOTOSHOPPED BABY PICTURE SPARKS PIERCING DISCUSSION,"(CNN) Enedina Vance was fed up. She felt like other parents didn't understand her message. She felt like they weren't listening to her.

So she got on her phone, found a picture of her 6-month-old daughter and pasted a diamond stud over the infant's dimple to make it look like she had a piercing.

Vance, a strong advocate against piercing or circumcising children, posted the edited picture to Facebook, where it had more than 13,000 shares as of Thursday afternoon.

""I make all of her decisions until she's 18, I made her, I own her!!"" she wrote.

What Vance didn't expect was the reaction she'd get from parents around the world. Outrage. Hate mail. Threats to call Child Protective Services.

But the image also proved her point, and it got parents talking.

""The reaction that parents have when they see this beautiful perfect baby being ... mutilated, that initial shock, that reaction of anger, I want them to hold on to that,"" the 35-year-old said.

Many thought photo was real

The stay-at-home mom from Fostoria, Ohio, knew that seeing a picture of a baby with a dimple piercing would get her family and friends talking, so she shared it in parenting Facebook groups.

The post quickly incited outrage among the parenting community, and she was called ""a bad mother"" and worse.

Many people assumed the piercing was real and lambasted Vance for her apparent decision.

""I seriously can not believe how many people missed that this was purely satirical, I actually used the hashtag #sarcasm,"" Vance wrote on Facebook. ""Yet people were still threatening to beat me to death, call child protective services, & take away my children.""

Other parents simply disagreed with her stance on piercing.

One woman wrote, ""I got my ears pierced as a baby. I grew up just fine. ... I'm having a girl and I will get her ears pierced.""

Ohio law allows children under age 18 to get piercings and tattoos with a parent or guardian present. Most states allow minors to be pierced with parental consent.

Amid the death threats and hate mail, Vance said she also got countless positive messages from parents. Some said they felt they didn't have a choice in whether their sons were circumcised. Another was told it was a ""cleanliness thing.""

""A lot of this responsibility lies on our medical community. They encourage parents,"" Vance said. ""It shouldn't be an option. It shouldn't be a question.""

'Not a good enough reason'

Vance didn't always feel so strongly about circumcision.

Coming from a family of all women, she said she didn't know a lot about circumcision until she became pregnant for the first time in the late '90s. Vance had twin girls, but the research she did stuck in her mind.

""It felt so outdated, so primitive,"" she said. ""We as a civilized society should have grown past this and (I) was shocked that cutting my infant's genitals was even an option.""

Many parents choose to circumcise their children because of hygienic, health or religious reasons.

In 2012, the American Academy of Pediatrics found that the health benefits of circumcision outweigh the risks. However, the academy said the benefits weren't great enough to recommend that all newborn boys be circumcised.

""There is no compelling reason to deny boys their legitimate right to make their own informed decision when they are old enough to do so,"" the report said.

Vance sees this as a call to action and will tell anyone she meets how she feels if it comes up in conversation. She protested last fall in Cleveland with the Bloodstained Men & Their Friends, an organization that advocates against circumcision.

But her beliefs extend beyond circumcision.

""No one has the right to alter, modify, or mutilate another human being's body for aesthetic purposes, not even parents,"" she said.

Vance has argued that ultimately, children should be able to decide for themselves.

""What 1-week-old is asking to have earrings?"" she said. ""Just because it looks cute, just because it looks better -- that's not a good enough reason."""
http://cnn.com/2017/07/09/middleeast/syria-ceasefire-begins/index.html,CEASEFIRE BROKERED BY US AND RUSSIA BEGINS IN SYRIA,"(CNN) A ceasefire brokered by the US, Russia and Jordan went into effect Sunday in southwest Syria as part of an agreement hailed as a precursor to greater cooperation between Russia and the US over the war-ravaged country.

The plan was announced Friday at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, after a meeting between US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.

The leaders also agreed to establish three de-escalation zones in Syria. Russian military police, coordinating with the US and Jordan, will initially ensure security around the de-escalation zone, officials said.

The ceasefire affects the regions of Deraa and Suweida, along the Jordanian border, as well as Quneitra, near borders with Lebanon and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights . The areas in southern Syria will be the first in which the US is party to a de-escalation zone.

White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said in a statement Saturday that such de-escalation zones are a US priority.

""The United States remains committed to defeating ISIS, helping to end the conflict in Syria, reducing suffering, and enabling people to return to their homes,"" he said. ""This agreement is an important step toward these common goals.""

The new brokered agreement is the fifth attempt at a ceasefire in a country that has been embroiled in conflict since 2011. Three of those ceasefires unraveled within months. The fourth attempt this May was never enforced when rebel groups denounced the deal shortly after its signing.

Greater US-Russia cooperation?

The US and Russia ""promised to ensure that all groups there comply with the ceasefire"" and ""provide humanitarian access,"" Lavrov said.

A State Department official said Friday that they're still working on how to monitor and enforce the ceasefire.

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who sat in on the discussion between the two leaders, told reporters Friday that the agreement signaled further cooperation in Syria.

The US and Russian governments have diverging long-term goals in Syria. Russia has spent the last two years supporting the Assad regime with airstrikes and special forces on the ground. In that time, the regime has gradually reasserted control over major cities, with rebel groups being finally driven out of Aleppo, the largest city in Syria, at the beginning of this year.

The US has focused on defeating ISIS by nurturing the Syrian Democratic Forces, an alliance of Arab tribes and Kurds, in the north and east of the country. Gradually, they have pushed ISIS out of large swathes of territory, aided by hundreds of coalition airstrikes, and are now inside Raqqa -- the self-proclaimed ISIS capital.

""This is our first indication of the US and Russia being able to work together in Syria,"" Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said.

News of a ceasefire agreement comes as US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are pushing into Raqqa.

Earlier, Tillerson said the US was prepared to work with Russia to establish no-fly zones in Syria in an effort to bring stability to the country.

A warning from Netanyahu

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave his guarded support to the ceasefire agreement, raising the specter of an empowered Hezbollah should the de-escalation zones allow the Syrian regime to capture more territory.

JUST WATCHED Syria: What Israel sees Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Syria: What Israel sees 02:41

The newly established de-escalation zones lie only a few kilometers from Israel's northeastern borders.

""Israel will welcome a genuine ceasefire in Syria, but this ceasefire must not enable the establishment of a military presence by Iran and its proxies in Syria in general and in southern Syria in particular,"" Netanyahu said ahead of his weekly Cabinet meeting on Sunday.

""I had deep discussions about this last week with US Secretary of State Tillerson and with Russian Vladimir Putin. Both told me that they understand Israel's position and will take our demands into account.""

Netanyahu said fears that the threat posed by Iran-backed Hezbollah to Israel could intensify as Syrian regime forces continue to recapture territory.

""For our part, we will continue to monitor developments beyond our borders while strongly upholding our red lines: prevent the strengthening of Hezbollah via Syria, with emphasis on the acquisition of precision weapons; prevent Hezbollah -- or Iranian forces -- from establishing a ground presence along our border; and prevent the establishment of an Iranian military presence in Syria as a whole,"" he said."

The offer for Orient Overseas International Ltd (OOIL) comes as China's government pushes to raise the country's profile in global shipping, which dovetails with its Belt and Road initiative aimed at increasing China's influence over distribution from Asia to Europe. Beijing merged two shippers last year to form COSCO Shipping which, after the latest deal, will rise from fourth to rank only behind Denmark's Maersk Line and Switzerland's Mediterranean Shipping Co (MSC). ""This is negative for Maersk and MSC,"" said Corrine Png, chief executive of Singapore-based transport stock researcher Crucial Perspective. A deal would make the Chinese shipper a ""tougher competitor to deal with on the major trade lanes."" State-backed COSCO Shipping on Sunday offered to buy each OOIL share at a 31.1 percent premium to their Friday close. A suitor's stock often falls after making a bid, but COSCO Shipping's Hong Kong-listed shares rose as much as 6 percent on Monday to their highest price in almost two years. OOIL stock rose as per usual for a target but at 20 percent, it was short of the offer price. Png said some investors may feel OOIL would be selling too soon after the container industry began to recover from a prolonged slowdown, or that the deal may not pass anti-trust regulators. ""This transaction is a sweeter deal for COSCO than for OOIL's shareholders,"" she said. ""OOIL could boost COSCO's recurring profit by 50 percent in the next two to three years."" The deal comes as Hong Kong's transport hub status dims. Its fortunes soared with the Pearl River Delta export boom of the 1990s, but its once world-leading port now languishes in fifth place by throughput, behind the mainland ports of Shanghai and Shenzhen. COSCO said it would to keep OOIL's global headquarters in Hong Kong but analysts said the city's port would still be affected by its takeover. ""COSCO also has (port) investments in Guangzhou,"" said Han Ning, China director for Drewry Shipping Consultants, referring to the nearby Chinese city whose port competes with Hong Kong for Pearl River Delta traffic. ""So if COSCO is looking at what should be its hub for the Pearl River Delta, it will look to strike a balance between Guangzhou and Hong Kong."" OOIL commands just under 3 percent of the global container shipping market and has significant exposure to the U.S. market. After the deal, COSCO Shipping can expect a U.S. market share of 18 percent from 11-12 percent currently, said COSCO general manager Zunwu Xu at a news conference on Monday. The acquisition would also strengthen COSCO Shipping's position in the port business, Xu said. ""The merger would be complementary as OOIL is strong in Transpacific and Intra-Asia trade, and COSCO has strong China domestic trade,"" said Samson Lo, head of Asia mergers-and-acquisitions at UBS, which is advising COSCO Shipping. ""The terminals and logistics businesses of OOIL can bring further synergies to COSCO as well."" COSCO Shipping is making its offer with Shanghai International Port Group Co Ltd. The shipping line said it would finance the deal with a bridge loan. Reporting by Brenda Goh in SHANGHAI and Kane Wu in HONG KONG; Writing by Adam Jourdan; Editing by Christopher Cushing"

In an impassioned speech, Salame likened the problem to a regular at a restaurant who asks for butter on his steak, only to be rebuffed by penny-pinching chefs in the kitchen.Just add butter! Salame implored his team.The three-word slogan quickly became both a rallying cry and an internal joke, and blue baseball caps emblazoned with the phrase in white lettering were passed around -- reminders that are now scattered about trading desks on the fourth and fifth floors at Goldmans headquarters in Manhattan, one of the people said.Salames pep talk is reminiscent of the long-term greedy philosophy espoused by senior partner Gustave Levy in the 1970s. In what became an oft-cited mantra, Levy urged his colleagues to ignore easy money in favor of lasting relationships.Salames plea was just one highlight in an unusual town hall for partners and managing directors, held after the firm reported revenue from fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading that fell short of analysts estimates. The meeting, which lasted more than an hour, would typically include a more structured style, but this time Salame held a round table to discuss Goldman Sachss troubles, the people said.The firms trading business is in a rare funk. Its bond traders were outdone last quarter by archrival Morgan Stanley for the first time in almost six years. In stocks, Goldman Sachs posted $1 billion less revenue last year than its competitor, the biggest gap since 2013.Both firms are scheduled to report second-quarter results next week. Goldmans trading revenue will probably decline 16 percent to about $3.10 billion, according to the average estimate among analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. At Morgan Stanley, the business is expected to generate $3.13 billion, a 4 percent drop.Read more: Morgan Stanley tops Goldman for first time since 2011Among other complaints, Salame blamed the problem on executives who spend too much time in offices instead of on the trading floor. And he said Goldman Sachss traders are failing to look at clients holistically, sometimes ignoring their relationship with the entire firm and focusing too narrowly on a specific transaction.Like the fictional diner in Salames restaurant analogy, clients who are treated well tend to come back, he said."

They can take their cases to immigration court while stay is in place

(CNN) Iraqi nationals with final orders of removal from the US cannot be deported for at least another two weeks, a federal judge has ruled.

Judge Mark Goldsmith extended a temporary stay blocking their deportation until July 24, according to the judge's order.

The judge said the court needed additional time to determine whether the court has jurisdiction over the case in the first place, according to court documents.

The group of Iraqi nationals who filed the initial lawsuit along with the ACLU argued that there was ""good cause"" for extending the stay, because Iraqis in danger of deportation face the same threats they did when the initial stay was granted a few weeks ago: fear of ""persecution, torture or even death,"" upon return to their country, according to court documents.

Attorneys arguing on behalf of the federal government did not initially agree, but conceded during the court hearing that the court had the power to extend the stay, according to court documents and Lee Gelernt, ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project deputy director.

To date, no fires tied to the defect have been reported to NHTSA or Continental, spokesmen for the company and the agency said.Mary Arraf, a U.S. spokeswoman for Continental, said the parts were made from the same type of industry-standard plastic called polyoxymethylen-copolymer. She said in the recalled vehicles, the material can break down due to environmental factors and exposure to acids in cleaning solutions, and that the risk of a crack can also be affected by where the part is installed in a vehicle.Its too early to estimate how many additional vehicles may need to be recalled but the situation highlights how one faulty part can ripple risk throughout the auto industry, said Dave Sullivan, an analyst with consultancy AutoPacific Inc.Thats kind of what the story of the whole auto industry is, Sullivan said. Consolidation has happened and theres a race for cheaper parts that are shared across more vehicles.The recalls so far affect certain Porsche Macan, Audi Q5, Audi Q7 and VW Touareg SUVs sold over the last decade. The fuel pump flange is generally mounted in the fuel tank and closes an opening used to mount other fuel and vapor management.The other companies Continental supplied the fuel pump flanges to were McLaren Automotive Ltd., Automobili Lamborghini SpA, Volvo Car Group and suppliers Magna International Inc., TI Automotive Ltd., Plastic Omnium, YAPP USA Automotive Systems Inc. and Kautex Textron GmbH.Continentals Arraf said the company is communicating with all of its potentially impacted customers and has not heard of any flanges leaking on vehicles other than those produced by VW, Porsche and Audi.A spokeswoman for Volkswagens U.S. unit didnt immediately respond to an email seeking comment."
http://cnn.com/2017/07/10/health/coffee-leads-to-longer-life-studies-reaffirm/index.html,"DRINKING MORE COFFEE LEADS TO A LONGER LIFE, TWO STUDIES SAY","(CNN) Greater consumption of coffee could lead to a longer life, according to two new studies published Monday.

One study surveyed more than 520,000 people in 10 European countries, making it the largest study to date on coffee and mortality, and found that drinking more coffee could significantly lower a person's risk of mortality.

The second study was more novel, as it focused on non-white populations. After surveying over 185,000 African-Americans, Native Americans, Hawaiians, Japanese-Americans, Latinos and whites, the researchers found that coffee increases longevity across various races.

People who drank two to four cups a day had an 18% lower risk of death compared with people who did not drink coffee, according to the study. These findings are consistent with previous studies that had looked at majority white populations, said Veronica Wendy Setiawan, associate professor of preventative medicine at USC's Keck School of Medicine, who led the study on nonwhite populations.

""Given these very diverse populations, all these people have different lifestyles. They have very different dietary habits and different susceptibilities -- and we still find similar patterns,"" Setiawan said.

The new study shows that there is a stronger biological possibility for the relationship between coffee and longevity and found that mortality was inversely related to coffee consumption for heart disease, cancer, respiratory disease, stroke, diabetes and kidney disease.

The study on European countries revealed an inverse association between coffee and liver disease, suicide in men, cancer in women, digestive diseases and circulatory diseases. Those who drank three or more cups a day had a lower risk for all-cause death than people who did not drink coffee.

Both studies were published in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

""We looked at multiple countries across Europe, where the way the population drinks coffee and prepares coffee is quite different,"" said Marc Gunter, reader in cancer epidemiology and prevention at Imperial College's School of Public Health in the UK, who co-authored the European study.

""The fact that we saw the same relationships in different countries is kind of the implication that its something about coffee rather than its something about the way that coffee is prepared or the way it's drunk,"" he said.

The biological benefits -- and caveats

Coffee is a complex mixture of compounds, some of which have been revealed in laboratories to have biological effects, Gunter said.

Studies have shown that certain compounds have neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce risk for illnesses like Parkinson's disease.

In the European study, people who were drinking coffee tended to have lower levels of inflammation, healthier lipid profiles and better glucose control compared with those who weren't. It is still unclear which particular compounds provide health benefits, but Gunter said he would be interested in exploring this further.

Both studies separated smokers from nonsmokers, since smoking is known to reduce lifespan and is linked to various deceases. However, they found that coffee had inverse effects on mortality for smokers too.

""Smoking doesn't seem to blunt the effects of coffee,"" Gunter said. ""It didn't matter whether you smoked or not. There was still a potential beneficial affect of coffee on mortality.""

However, Dr. Alberto Ascherio, professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said people should be wary of this finding.

""Even if it was in some way true, it doesn't make sense to me, because by smoking, you increase your mortality several-fold. Then, if you reduce it by 10% drinking coffee, give me a break,"" said Ascherio, who was not involved in the study.

""I think it's a dangerous proposition because it suggests that a smoker can counteract the effects of smoking by drinking coffee, which is borderline insane.""

The studies complement work that has been done on coffee and mortality, he said, and it has been reasonably documented that coffee drinkers have a lower risk of death.

With all observations from previous studies, however, it's difficult to exclude the possibility that coffee drinkers are just healthier to begin with, Gunter said.

People who avoid coffee, particularly in places like the US and Europe where drinking the beverage is very common, may do so because they have health problems. Their higher mortality rate could be a result of them being less healthy to begin with.

""I think that the solid conclusion is that if you're a coffee drinker, keep drinking your coffee and be happy,"" Ascherio said. And if you're not? ""I think you can go on drinking your tea or water without a problem.""

Meanwhile, Gunter and Setiawan stand a bit more firmly on coffee as a health benefit.

""The takeaway message would be that drinking a couple cups of coffee a day doesn't do you any harm, and actually, it might be doing you some good,"" he said.

""Moderate coffee consumption can be incorporated into a healthy diet and lifestyle,"" Setiawan said. ""This studies and the previous studies suggest that for a majority of people, there's no long term harm from drinking coffee."""

As he was ironing out details of that agreement, he was careful to keep Qatar in the loop. ""Of course, I won't go to the same field in Iran without telling Qatar,"" Pouyanne told Reuters. ""The Iranian block where we are supposed to produce is next to the border with Qatar. When I traveled to Doha I discussed it with the (Qatari) authorities and they told us: 'It is ok - we know you'."" Pouyanne says Total strictly respects confidentiality of data vis-à-vis each country. The executive's cross-border strategy, however, appears to be paying early dividends. ""I would expect Total to be in the strongest position for the new (Qatari) project, because of the political issues at play and their recent deals in (Iran's) South Pars,"" one senior Gulf energy source said. On one level, working with both countries who share a prized gas asset seems obvious. But it is not without risks for Total. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt  have imposed political and economic sanctions on Qatar, demanding that it stops fostering terrorism and courting Iran, Riyadh's main rival. Qatar denies the accusations. Besides Iran and Qatar, Total also has large projects in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, highlighting the complexity of investing in the Middle East. Qatar, already the world's largest liquefied gas exporter, lifted a self-imposed ban on development of the North Field in April and last week it said it would raise gas output capacity by around 30 percent to 100 billion cubic meters. The move was widely seen as a show of strength in its dispute with Gulf neighbors and Egypt. Qatar has built its gas export power over the past decade with support from global oil majors including ExxonMobil, Total, and Royal Dutch Shell. The projects have generated billions of dollars for Qatar and its Western partners and the planned expansion to its gas capacity would make Qatar even more dominant in the gas market, accounting for a third of current global LNG output. Sources told Reuters earlier this month that Exxon, Shell and Total have all expressed interest in helping Qatar expand its gas facilities, with top executives traveling to Doha in recent weeks even after a spike in political tensions. Exxon, Shell and Total declined to comment on plans to participate in Qatar's tenders to expand gas capacity, which are yet to be announced and will take several years to complete. Even without those tenders, Total's role in Qatar is set to grow significantly after it won a 30 percent stake in 2016 in a new 25-year contract to operate its largest offshore Al-Shaheen oilfield.  Total, which will take over the field operation from Maersk Oil on July 14, plans to invest $2 billion in expanding the field over the next five years. With Qatar's gas production costs among the lowest in the world, being a part of any expansion would give Total a strategic advantage over rivals in the fast-growing global LNG market. Total's involvement in fields on both sides of the Qatari-Iranian border may also help save on costs and service contracts as well as better understand the fields' geology, although Pouyanne said there was no mechanism to coordinate production jointly by the countries. The development of the new capacity over the next 5-7 years could cost between $14-$18 billion, according to consultant Wood Mackenzie. ""Qatar may also be keen to show it is still open for business despite the current diplomatic disputes with some of its Gulf neighbors,"" it said.

Cohen and legions of Wall Street bankers, could be in such fiscal trouble. Last year, the per-capita income there was $71,033, the highest in the nation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.For all that, state-worker pensions have been underfunded for decades. Tax increases aimed at closing deficits have put a strain on an economy struggling from the loss of high-paying finance jobs, leaving it among the few that still havent recovered from the recession. The hedge fund industry fell on hard times, with about 1,060 shuttering globally last year. UBS Group AG abandoned the worlds largest trading floor in Stamford after the financial crisis, and the Royal Bank of Scotland downsized its office there. Pension, debt and health-care costs just kept growing.Theres a limit to how much you can tax and theres a limit to how much you can cut before you damage the viability and attractiveness of the city, Mayor Luke Bronin said in May. Right now, from a fiscal standpoint, you have a capital city fighting with its hands behind its back.""Like many other local governments across the country, Hartford -- city of Mark Twain and the young John Pierpont Morgan -- has been grappling with budget problems for years. On the same day that Illinois lawmakers finally scraped together a long-overdue budget, Hartford hired the law firm Greenberg Traurig LLP to evaluate its options, which include bankruptcy. It would be the first prominent U.S. municipality to seek protection from its creditors since Detroit did so in 2013.As for Connecticut, it faces a projected two-year deficit of $5 billion that lawmakers havent figured out how to close, even though the new fiscal year began on July 1.In Hartford, the woes have been piling up for a while. Like Puerto Rico, which filed a record-setting bankruptcy in May, or even Greece, the city came to the edge in the usual way: slowly, then suddenly. The population declined 23 percent between 1960 and 2000 and has remained stagnant ever since. A third of its residents live in poverty, a higher share than in Baltimore or Newark. From 2010 to 2014, the metropolitan area saw the fifth-biggest decline in employers in the nation, according to the Economic Innovation Group, a Washington-based public policy organization.Hartfords tax base of about $4.1 billion is about two-thirds that of neighbor West Hartford, which has far fewer residents, because half of the property -- state buildings, hospitals, universities, non-profit agencies -- is tax-exempt. Hartford has the highest property tax rate in the state and faces a $50 million deficit, nearly 10 percent of its budget. The citys credit rating may be downgraded deeper into junk by Moodys Investors Service.Uninsured Hartford bonds maturing in 2024 traded at yields of more than 6 percent in late June, compared with about 4.4 percent in January, as investors jitters mounted. The city has $672 million in debt, including $228 million of uninsured bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It also guarantees about $70 million in debt for a minor-league baseball stadium downtown.Dannel MalloyGovernor Dannel Malloy and Republican and Democratic leaders in the legislature agree the bankruptcy of the states capital isnt another negative headline they need. General Electric Co. has decamped from Fairfield to Boston, and last week Aetna Inc. said it was moving its corporate headquarters from Hartford, where it has been since 1853, to New York. About 250 jobs are going with it, though thousands will stay in town.The state needs a budget that supports Hartford, its residents and its employers, said Chris McClure, a spokesman for Malloy. In the absence of action by the General Assembly on a budget vote, its entirely appropriate that the city explore all its options and prepare for every contingency."" Greenberg Traurigs team will be led by Nancy Mitchell, a co-chair of the firms restructuring practice, the city said in a statement. When Hartford was soliciting proposals from firms that specialize in bankruptcy, Council President Thomas Clarke told the local newspaper that looking into court protection from creditors would only be a last ditch option.They will be working with us to examine all options for putting the city of Hartford on a sustainable path,"" the mayor said in a statement. As we start a new fiscal year without a state budget and with significant uncertainty, we will have the advice and counsel of an experienced and highly respected restructuring firm.""In 2016, Bronin, a Democrat, took over a city that had been delaying its fiscal reckoning by pushing debt payments into the future, draining reserves and resorting to one-time measures, such as selling a parking garage, while its debt swelled by 52 percent from 2011 to 2015, according to Moodys figures.Since taking office, hes cut 100 jobs and renegotiated leases and energy contracts. Bronins been less successful in getting concessions from unions: The citys fiscal 2017 budget assumed $16.5 million of concessions, the bulk of which havent materialized.Hartford managed to strike a deal with its firefighters that saves about $4 million a year through 2020 by freezing pay increases, increasing pension contributions, lowering salaries for new hires and requiring employees to pay more for health care.The city could renegotiate labor contracts and cut debt and pensions in bankruptcy, as a handful of cities have done since the recession. But it would need the governors consent to file for Chapter 9.Bronin is lobbying for the state to fully fund a program that compensates local governments for revenue lost to tax-exempt properties, which alone would provide enough money to close next years deficit, and has joined with cities pushing to raise Connecticuts 6.35 percent sales tax to 6.99 percent to provide more aid.He also persuaded Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., Travelers Cos. and Aetna to pledge $50 million to the city over five years as part of a comprehensive and sustainable solution for Hartford."""
http://cnn.com/2017/07/10/health/tobacco-movies-teen-smoking-study/index.html,TOBACCO USE JUMPS 80% IN TOP-GROSSING MOVIES,"(CNN) In 2016, 41% of top-grossing US movies showed people using tobacco, according to a recent report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , a decrease from the year before. However, there was an 80% increase in incidents of tobacco use in those movies from 2015 to 2016.

The numbers are prompting concern from public health researchers and advocates over the effects these scenes have on young people's behavior.

""We've known for a while that the more you see smoking on screen, the more likely you are to see youth smoking cigarettes in real life,"" said Michael Tynan, lead author of the report and a public health analyst at the CDC's Office on Smoking and Health. ""There's a causal relationship between the two.""

The data from the new report were taken from Thumbs Up! Thumbs Down! , a project of the nonprofit Breathe California of Sacramento-Emigrant Trails . Since 1991, the organization has collected data on tobacco use by counting the number of times a tobacco product is used or implied to be used in a movie scene.

The new report crunched the numbers from 2010 to 2016. The use of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, hookahs, smokeless tobacco and e-cigarettes was recorded in each of the top 10 highest-grossing movies at the US box office for each week of each year.

There was a steady decline in the amount of tobacco use shown in movies from 2005 to 2010. But in the next six years, the incidence fluctuated. It reached a peak in 2016, with 3,145 tobacco incidents in 143 movies.

Of 2016's youth-rated movies -- including G, PG and PG-13 ratings -- 26% featured tobacco incidents. Sixty-seven percent of R-rated movies in 2016 had tobacco incidents. Compared with 2010, the percentage of movies depicting the use of tobacco decreased slightly; the 2010 rates were 31% for youth-rated movies and 71% for R-rated.

Tobacco use was featured in 41% of the surveyed movies in 2016, down from 50% in 2015.

However, the number of tobacco incidents within movies actually increased by 72% from 2010 to 2016. And from 2015 to 2016, there was an 80% increase, from 1,743 incidents to 3,145.

""To me, this shows that the studios are capable of reducing the amount of smoking in films,"" said Stanton Glantz , one of the study authors and a tobacco control professor at the University of California, San Francisco. ""They went whole years without showing smoking in youth-rated movies, but they've stopped doing it.

""It was like they were getting the arsenic out of the popcorn,"" he joked, ""but they didn't finish the job.""

Tynan, Glantz and their colleagues noted limitations of the report: First, many movies were left out out of the analysis, though they noted that movies ranked in the top 10 usually account for 96% of all ticket sales.

Dan Romer , director of the Adolescent Communication Institute at the University of Pennsylvania, identified another limitation as those was watching the movie were unknown: Audiences could be filled with adults rather than youth.

""I don't want to downplay what they're saying. I think it's important to point out there's still a lot of smoking in movies,"" said Romer, who was not involved in the research. ""But it's hard to know from their study if it's the kind of movies that have a high viewership in adolescents.""

Also not accounted for were the numerous TV shows and made for TV movies that could also expose youths to tobacco and smoking.

Suggestions for improvement

The U.S. surgeon general released a report in 2012 directly illustrating a causal relationship between watching smoking in movies and youth starting to smoke.

In response to this, Glantz suggested measures that could be taken by the movie industry to better regulate tobacco depictions.

First, the Motion Picture Association of America , which assigns movie ratings, could give an R rating to any movie with smoking or tobacco use.

""The MPAA needs to modernize the rating system to reflect the conclusive science that putting smoking on a screen increases the chances of youth smoking and then dying prematurely as a result,"" he said.

Other recommendations include requiring film studios to certify that no payments have been received for using tobacco in movies. He also suggested that state and local governments could decline to give subsidies to films that portray tobacco.

The Motion Picture Association of America, the trade association representing six of the major Hollywood film studios, declined to comment on the new study.

'This person is a risk-taker'

Romer, who conducted a separate study that analyzed the incidence of tobacco use in movies from 1950 to 2006, found a decline over the time period he studied. He believes that this trend paralleled tobacco usage in everyday life through the years.

""The amount of smoking seen in the movies was remarkably consistent with the overall prevalence rates of smoking in the country,"" he said. ""Nowadays, there aren't as many people smoking anymore, so there's also less of that in the movies.""

What is it about smoking in the movies that makes children want to try it? Romer believes it's the ""edgy"" nature of movie characters.

""Hollywood now uses smoking as a cue to say that this person is a risk-taker and kind of an edgy character,"" he said. ""Not very normative and sort of on the fringe today. And so an adolescent that finds that appealing might say, 'I want to be like that person. I'm going to smoke.' ""

Craig Detweiler , a film historian and communication professor at Pepperdine University, said the ""coolness"" factor is hard for filmmakers to give up.

""There's so many iconic images of cool associated with smoking that it's a hard habit for actors and filmmakers to break,"" he said. ""The tension arises because filmmakers are often going for a particular look or feel. Smoke is very photogenic, and actors are always looking for something to do with their hands, a bit of business.""

He added, ""I think the challenge is for studio and filmmakers to put ethics ahead of aesthetics."""
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-10/working-past-70-americans-can-t-seem-to-retire,WORKING PAST 70: AMERICANS CANT SEEM TO RETIRE,"More and more Americans are spending their golden years on the job.Almost 19 percent of people 65 or older were working at least part-time in the second quarter of 2017, according to the U.S. jobs report released on Friday. The age groups employment/population ratio hasnt been higher in 55 years, before American retirees won better health care and Social Security benefits starting in the late 1960s.And the trend looks likely to continue. Millennials, prepare yourselves. Better yet, consider this and this, so you have a choice in the matter when your time comes.Certainly baby boomers are increasingly ignoring the traditional retirement age of 65. Last quarter, 32 percent of Americans 65 to 69 were employed. Even past age 70, a growing number of seniors are declining to, or unable to, retire. Last quarter, 19 percent of 70- to 74-year-olds were working, up from 11 percent in 1994.Older Americans are working more even as those under 65 are working less, a trend that the Bureau of Labor Statistics expects to continue. By 2024, 36 percent of 65- to 69-year-olds will be active participants in the labor market, the BLS says. Thats up from just 22 percent in 1994. A number of factors are keeping older Americans in the workforce. Many are healthier and living longer than previous generations. Some decide not to fully retire because they enjoy their jobs or just want to stay active and alert. Others need the money. The longer you work, the easier it is to afford a comfortable retirement.  Longer lives and rising health care costs have made retirement more expensive at the same time that stagnant wages and the decline of the traditional pension have made it harder to save enough. The U.S. isnt the only place people are planning to work longer. Around the globe, workers of all ages are moving their retirement goals later and later in life.Even after they consider themselves officially ""retired,"" most Americans are hoping to work a little bit. According to a survey by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, or EBRI, 79 percent of U.S. workers expect to supplement their retirement income by working for pay.Theres a big problem with these plans. Just because you want to work doesnt mean you can. When surveyed, 61 percent of American retirees say they retired sooner than theyd planned. Thats more than anywhere else in the world, according to the 2017 Aegon Retirement Readiness Survey, of 16,000 people in 15 countries. Globally, 39 percent of retirees say they quit working early. Even part-time work may be unrealistic. EBRI finds that just 29 percent of retirees say they worked for pay at some point in their retirement. Health problems may force you to quit. While longevity has generally improved along with medical care, especially for the wealthy and well educated, more recent trends in the U.S. show many Americans' health deteriorating. And employers might not be interested in you.Although age discrimination has been illegal for 50 years, employers continue to see older workers as a liability, said Ruth Milkman, a sociology professor at the City University of New York. Seniors who want to extend a full-time career may be forced to take temporary jobs, for example, or work as independent contractors. Frozen out of standard employment, older workers turn to more precarious (and less well-compensated) employment, Milkman said at a conference last month.Rather than retire, older workers sometimes switch from traditional jobs to self-employment, according to a study released last month by the National Bureau of Economic Research that analyzed U.S. tax and survey data. In the process, they often switch occupations as well. They pay an economic price for going solo, the study finds, with average annual earnings dropping by $18,160 for older workers.The irony is, those seniors who find it easiest to keep workinghealthy, well-educated, and highly skilled people who enjoy their jobstend to be the least likely to need the money. Other older Americans, faced with few good job choices, often just decide to retire and and live frugally off Social Security and savings. The share of older people in the workforce is higher than at any point since before the creation of Medicare. Even more older Americans might be out there working, though, if they were healthier and had better job prospects. "

British media had speculated Trump's trip had been quietly canceled

Hamburg, Germany (CNN) US President Donald Trump said he expects a ""powerful"" trade deal with the UK ""very, very quickly,"" confirming that the two countries are currently working on an agreement.

Trump made the comments Saturday as he met with British Prime Minister Theresa May at the G20 meeting in Hamburg, Germany . The US President also confirmed he would visit London, but didn't give details of the timing.

May is looking to secure a deal with the US as Britain renegotiates its terms of trade with the European Union ahead of Brexit -- its withdrawal from the 28-nation bloc. Trump is also looking for high-value bilateral deals as he threatens to pull the US out of multilateral trade agreements, including NAFTA.

""We're working on a trade deal, which will be a very, very big deal, very powerful deal, great for both countries, and I think we'll have that done very, very quickly,"" Trump said.

""We've had tremendous talks. There's no country that could possibly be closer than our countries and for a long time,"" he said, adding that he and May had developed ""a very special relationship"" and that trade would be big factor between their countries.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-g20-germany-putin-trump-idUSKBN19T0R9,PUTIN SAYS TRUMP WAS 'SATISFIED' WITH HIS ELECTION MEDDLING DENIALS,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday he thought his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump had been satisfied with his assertions that Russia had not meddled in the U.S. presidential election. Speaking at the end of a G20 summit in Germany where the two leaders met face-to-face for the first time, Putin said he believed he had been able to establish a personal relationship with Trump, and that the initial groundwork had been laid for an improvement in U.S.-Russian ties. Their meeting, on the sidelines of the Hamburg summit, was subject to intense scrutiny, following allegations that Moscow had tried to help Trump win the White House, and a Washington investigation into the Russia ties of Trump associates. Putin was pressed by reporters at a news conference to share details of the discussion he had with Trump about alleged Russian election interference. Russia has denied trying to influence the U.S. election. ""(Trump) asked a lot of questions on this subject. I, in as much as I was able, answered these questions. It seems to me that he took these (answers) on board and agreed with them, but in actual fact, it's best to ask him how he views this,"" Putin told one reporter. Pressed again later in the same news conference by reporters about what precisely Trump had told him, Putin said: ""He started to ask pointed questions, he was really interested in particular details. I, as much as I could, answered him in a fairly detailed way. ""I believe it would not be entirely appropriate on my part to disclose details of my discussion with Mr Trump. He asked, I answered him. He asked pointed questions, I answered them. It seemed to me that he was satisfied with those answers,"" Putin said. Putin also spoke warmly of Trump's personal qualities. The two men have spoken by telephone since Trump won the U.S. presidential election last year, but had not met until the G20 summit in Hamburg. ""I believe that we have established personal relations already,"" Putin told a news conference. ""The TV Trump is very different from the person in reality. He is absolutely precise, he reacts as you would expect to his interlocutor, he analyses fairly quickly, answers questions that are put to him. ""It seems to me that if we build our relations the way that our conversation went yesterday, then we all have grounds to believe that we can, at least in part, restore the level of cooperation that we need,"" Putin said. He said in particular that the Trump administration was taking a more pragmatic stance on the conflict on Syria. A ceasefire deal for southern Syria that was announced during the summit was the result of that new approach, Putin said, and represented a ""breakthrough.""

The cuts at Emirates, which froze hiring last summer and hasnt taken on new crew in months, began in the last few weeks and affect middle and upper-level managers, they said.Dubai-based Emirates said there is no company-wide program to reduce headcount and that there is no change in staff turnover rates in the past weeks.The carrier continues to hire for critical roles, a spokeswoman said in an emailed response to questions, noting that recruitment has slowed down as we streamline our operations, introduce new technologies, and find ways to better deploy existing resources internally.Emirates Group, which includes the airline and other travel and tourism entities, increased its workforce 11 percent in the fiscal year ended March 31 to more than 105,000 employees.Gulf airlines have had to adapt to tougher business conditions after years of expansion, with challenges ranging from the U.S. ban on travelers from predominantly Muslim countries to reduced spending power in the region due to low oil prices. Emirates, which last year posted its first annual profit drop since 2012, has streamlined operations, and the company has hired an outside consultant to assist in the review, one of the people said.Abu-Dhabi based competitor Etihad Airways PJSC has also cut jobs amid an organizational restructuring, in an effort to reduce costs and improve productivity.To lift revenue, Emirates has begun charging for seat selection, added fees for its airport lounges and may introduce premium-economy seats to boost sales amid waning growth in business class.In a sign that measures taken so far have helped boost performance, Emirates President Tim Clark said in June that first-half earnings could be ahead of the year-ago period.The airline is also considering combining with its low-cost sister FlyDubai, and examining the possibility of cooperating with discount long-haul carriers, whose rapid expansion in Asia and Europe poses a threat to its hub-based model."
http://cnn.com/2017/07/10/us/avalanche-of-hate-daily-stormer-lawsuit/index.html,HOW A MONTANA MOM BECAME THE TARGET OF A NEO-NAZI TROLL STORM,"This story addresses hate speech and contains offensive language that may be disturbing to readers.

Whitefish, Montana (CNN) Once the calls began, they did not stop. Swiping to decline a call just led to the phone ringing again. Blocked number after blocked number filled up the voice mail.

Deleting one message just created space for another to take its place.

Then came the tweets and the email messages.

The volume was overwhelming. The content: vile and terrifying.

Gunshots rang out from voice mails. Emails and texts read: ""I hope you die,"" ""Kill yourself,"" ""We will take pleasure in your pain.""

Tanya Gersh found herself buried in an avalanche of hate, one she had not seen coming and one that focused on one fact: She's Jewish.

Gersh was called a ""bitch,"" ""a worthless c**t,"" and told countless times she was nothing more than a filthy ""k**e."" The vile and ugly words were spelled out in full when sent to Gersh.

The messages began late at night and continued into the early hours, keeping her family awake. Or there was a night of silence, broken by an onslaught at 4 a.m., jolting the family from sleep.

One voice mail -- ""You are surprisingly easy to find on the Internet. And in real life"" -- ended Gersh's lifelong practice of leaving her home and car unlocked in her little Montana town, nestled by a lake in the Rocky Mountains.

It became unbearable, Gersh said. She described panic attacks, vomiting, shaking and sweating. And then the times she could not even catch her breath.

Now, she was in fear of almost anyone she met. Her old way of life had been washed away. She was now in an America full of hate. It was an America where racism and bigotry have powerful online platforms.

Gersh learned that one blog post could lead to an anonymous online assault by a group of hateful people hell bent on destroying her life. All it took was a few keystrokes, amplified by a social media megaphone, to send the deluge of repulsive messages her way and heighten tensions in this quaint ski resort town.

All because of what started, Gersh says, as a ""mother-to-mother"" chat.

Gersh appears to have become a target for hate after contacting tenants of a local building. Gersh says she was then called by the building's owner, Sherry Spencer, the mother of white supremacist Richard Spencer.

This mixed-use property was at the center of a dispute between Sherry Spencer and Tanya Gersh.

Gersh says she warned Sherry Spencer about looming protests at the building in Whitefish, a Montana town of 7,300 where both women live.

Gersh says she advised Spencer to disavow the views of her son, including that the United States is a country for white people. She says she offered to sell Spencer's property as of a way of defusing tensions in town. Gersh suggested Spencer donate money to a human rights group.

Sherry Spencer refused to speak to CNN when we reached her on the phone. Earlier, she wrote in a blog post that Gersh, a Realtor, had threatened her, saying protesters and media would turn up and drive down the building's value if she didn't sell.

Whitefish Police Chief Bill Dial said Sherry Spencer did not file a complaint with police, though her son Richard Spencer accused Gersh of extortion in interviews and a video diary. No law enforcement agency has filed any charges relating to the dispute.

Are y'all ready for an old-fashioned Troll Storm? Andrew Anglin, founder of DailyStormer.com

There was comment aplenty, though, on DailyStormer.com, which spews neo-Nazi propaganda.

Andrew Anglin, the site's founder, accused Gersh of extortion in a blog post. And he exhorted readers to send Gersh -- whom he also identified as Jewish -- enough messages to make a point.

""Let's hit 'em up,"" he posted. ""Are y'all ready for an old-fashioned Troll Storm?""

He then told them: ""(I)t's that time.""

'These are not trolls. They are terrorists'

Tanya Gersh says harassing messages reached her in every corner of her life.

For three months, packed luggage sat on the floor of Gersh's home.

She debated fleeing, to escape what felt like an army of online hate coming after her.

""We were scared that they were going to show up,"" Gersh says. ""It got worse and worse and worse and worse. They just kept perpetuating it.""

Anyone who read Daily Stormer had access to all Gersh's information after Anglin posted it time and again. He put up photos and personal details: phone number, address, workplace and social media profiles -- including one used by her 12-year-old son. Each contained instructions to tell Gersh how they felt.

""Listen here you fucking Jew. You had better back off and leave Richard Spencer's mom alone, you dirty scumbag,"" one caller said on Gersh's voice mail. ""You fucking Jew. You had better back off of Richard Spencer's mom. Everybody is watching you.""

The Daily Stormer published more about Gersh and her ""Jew agenda,"" once with a doctored photo showing her and her tween son on the gates of the Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz.

A tweet was sent to Gersh showing her surrounded by gas, with the message: ""Hickory dickory dock, the kike ran up the clock. The clock struck three and Internet Nazis trolls gassed the rest of them.""

More messages referenced crematoriums and said she should have died in the Holocaust.

A tweet to her 12-year-old son had an image of an oven with the message: ""PSsst kid there is a free X-box inside this oven.""

Gersh thinks she will always be haunted by those images, and by the family talks she was forced to have. They had known the horrors of the Holocaust, but to them it had been something foreign and distant. No longer.

I'm going to make sure it doesn't happen to anybody else. Tanya Gersh, Whitefish resident

She hangs her head, remembering the conversation.

""I never imagined that I would have to teach my children that they might be hated because they are Jewish,"" she says.

For Gersh, these threats were personal and real, not to be confused with generic if vile ramblings on an online comments board.

""These are not trolls. They are terrorists,"" Gersh says. ""They are very harmful, they are very malicious and they are dangerous.""

And Gersh decided to take a stand. She didn't know who had threatened her -- they hid behind withheld numbers and untraceable email addresses -- but knew who she believed had sent them into her life.

""Andrew Anglin has done this to so many people. I'm going to make sure it doesn't happen to anybody else,"" Gersh says defiantly.

Encouraged by the Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama-based organization that monitors hate crimes across the country, she decided to sue Anglin, accusing him of intentional infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy and violation of Montana's anti-intimidation statue.

Protected speech ... or hate?

Andrew Anglin is the founder of The Daily Stormer website.

On DailyStormer.com Anglin wrote he has hired a First Amendment lawyer to fight the lawsuit; he says he was simply ""blogging."" A prominent fundraising post declares: ""The Daily Stormer is being sued by Jewish terrorists. In order to survive, we need shekels."" It is paired with another doctored photo of Tanya Gersh, her head on a dragon's body being slain by a knight on a white horse with the face of Anglin. So far there have been around 2,000 donations, totaling in excess of $150,000.

Still, Anglin did ask readers to leave the Gersh family alone, allow the case to proceed and be simply about protected speech.

""(T)hough this is going to get a lot of publicity, I am asking all of you, genuinely, that you don't attempt to contact the Gershes during this process,"" Anglin wrote on the site. ""This has escalated from jokes on the Internet to something which could potentially lead to a big step towards the hellish, Orwellian world that the enemies of freedom wish to bring down on this country.""

Anglin's has raised $150,000 online after he asked for supporters to donate alongside an image of himself on a horse with a spear through Gersh.

Lawyers for Gersh say it is ironic that they cannot find Anglin -- a man apparently proud of what he's done -- to serve him to compel him to appear in court. But they expect the case to proceed.

""I hope the result is that we get fair compensation for the Gersh family, that we punish Andrew Anglin and the people who are associated with him in this circle of terror,"" SPLC co-counsel John Morrison says. ""And beyond that, my hope is that we wind up convincing him to stop.""

Morrison says they have a strong case.

""This is not free speech, this is nothing protected by the First Amendment, this is not the expression of political opinion,"" he says. ""The purpose of this is to damage these people, the purpose of this is to cause them fear and emotional harm, and that's illegal.""

CNN reached out to Anglin, who told us he now lives in Lagos, Nigeria, where he says his rights to say what he wants are not limited. He declined to comment to us on the Gersh case.

Morrison and Gersh believe Anglin is not the whole problem, as he has followers ready to be encouraged to act. Morrison describes them as an ""army"" that carries out ""vicious attacks that are done in a concerted way at the beck and call of a commander who puts out the orders on this website.""

Robert Ray, who writes features for The Daily Stormer under the name ""Azzmador,"" told CNN he was ""absolutely"" OK with what was written on the site about Gersh. He called her a ""Jewish terrorist"" for allegedly threatening Richard Spencer's mother.

""I want anyone who thinks that they can exert this terroristic activist style political pressure on family members of people whose political views they don't like, I want them all terrified to do that,"" Ray says.

Robert Ray, a Daily Stormer writer, supports Anglin's call to action.

But he adds that messages to Gersh were not threats, but expressions of opinion.

""There's no evidence that anyone from, who was influenced by Daily Stormer, made any death threats or anything,"" he says.

Gersh says she does not expect to change the beliefs of Anglin or his followers. But she does have a message for them.

""You are allowed to believe whatever you want to believe but you absolutely cannot take your beliefs and use it to terrorize,"" Gersh says.

Words do matter, she and her legal team argue. The SPLC tracks instances of hatred from all groups. It says the unapologetic hatred on the Daily Stormer -- which also takes aim at African-Americans and opponents of President Donald Trump, for example -- is a catalyst for division. Among its readers were Charleston, South Carolina, church mass killer Dylann Roof and the murderer of Jo Cox, a British legislator.

For Gersh, this is a new reality. She had never never heard jokes about Jews or been subject to anything anti-Semitic before this. Now she is consumed by fighting a battle she had thought was over. She talks about the Nazis -- with their swastikas, concentration camps and genocide -- being defeated decades ago. And how the world stood up then to say ""Never again.""

But now she finds it is her turn to stand up to another group of people who are adamant in their hatred of Jews. She says she must take on the people who told her she should have died long ago and those who told her they hope she kills herself now.

So Gersh hopes her voice is clear when she echoes those words of warning again to those who have threatened her.

""What we are saying is never again.""

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-renzi-idUSKBN19U0CV?il=0,ITALY'S FORMER PM RENZI SETS OUT NEW ECONOMIC AGENDA IN BOOK,"MILAN (Reuters) - Former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said he would ask the European Union for less stringent deficit requirements for five years in exchange for a commitment to improve the country's debt pile if re-elected. Renzi said he would keep the national deficit at 2.9 percent, just a notch under a EU ceiling of 3 percent, but would use an estimated 30 billion euros to cut taxes and push growth, in excerpts of a new book which were released by daily Il Sole 24 Ore on Sunday.  The 42-year old resigned as prime minister in December after a crushing defeat in a national referendum over constitutional reforms aimed at streamlining the country's lawmaking process.  He was replaced by his foreign minister, Paolo Gentiloni, but kept his position as head of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) and has been working on a political comeback since stepping down. ""A strong agreement in which Italy commits to reducing its debt to GDP ratio through stronger growth.... in exchange for a return for at least five years... with deficit at 2.9 percent,"" he wrote, adding this would be the PD's agenda for the next general election, due by May 2018.   Italy has an official 2017 target of bringing the deficit down to 2.1 percent of GDP, from 2.4 percent in 2016. But the European Commission says Italy needs faster deficit reduction to bring down its overall debt pile which is the highest in the euro zone after Greece's.    ""I do not accept that Italy is treated like an undisciplined scholar that must be told to behave. This is an attitude that hurts Europe... which becomes an unpleasant watchman,"" Renzi writes.    Italy's economy has been the most sluggish in the euro zone for more than a decade, and the government's 1.1 percent growth forecast for this year would be only about half the average expected for the region as a whole.   Renzi's PD party fared badly in local elections last month, but polls show his party is still one of Italy's most popular nationally, just behind the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.  But with internal party rifts and Renzi's confrontational style, there is no guarantee that he would be named prime minister of a future coalition government even if the PD were to win the most votes during the election.

http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/ciociaria-italy-luxury-stays/index.html,"CIOCIARIA, ITALY: SECRET REGION OFFERS LUXURY STAYS - CNN.COM","Silvia Marchetti, for CNN Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Updated 7th July 2017

(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ ""You see all this? It now belongs to my family after decades of hard labor and sweat. We've redeemed it,"" says Lorenzo Pacitti as he points to the hills surrounding his estate.

Pacitti is a rosy-cheeked shepherd, but not an ordinary one. He's a billionaire, like all his colleagues who inhabit Comino Valley in Ciociaria, a virtually unknown misty patch of fluorescent green land stuck in central wild mountains of Italy

Its name comes from cioce, the hairy sheep-leather shoes worn by herdsmen in the past. Ciociaria isn't officially on a map, and is a secret even to most Italians.

This is where skeletons of our early ancestors were found in deep caves, where the fiery Samnite tribes fought against the bloodthirsty Romans, and where the Gustav Line ran during World War II.

For centuries, it was a no-man's kingdom at the boundaries of the rich papal state -- a poor and outcast region roamed by bandits, saints and pilgrims. But today it's enjoying a renaissance thanks to farmers, breeders and shepherds who've made a fortune with pigs, cured meats and mouthwatering cheeses.

They've opened rural resorts and gourmet restaurants. Their lavish villas dot the landscape amid medieval sanctuaries, healing fountains and pilgrimage sites rising from the ashes of pagan temples.

Sheep, goats and cows still cross the streets. Shepherds stop to say hello. But they've evolved, too. They don't wear cioce anymore or go around snatching abandoned properties with large bundles of cash stuffed in their pockets.

Victorian cheese bistrot

Ciociaria owes its name to the traditional shoes known as ""cioce"" worn by ancient shepherds.

Pacitti, who drives a sleek, green Kawasaki motorbike, is the owner of a pinkish Victorian-style villa called Casa Lawrence, where English writer D. H. Lawrence sojourned in 1919 to write his novel ""The Lost Girl.""

Part of the mansion has been turned into a rustic cheesery, dubbed Caciosteria. There's also a B&B featuring vintage furniture, Lawrence's bed, chamberpot, bathtub, clothes, pajamas and writing table. There's an eerie ambiance at the reading corner where the author loved to sit and meditate, taking in the bucolic view.

""The property passed into my ancestors' hands because the owner, Lawrence's British host, had no more heirs or couldn't reach them. When he died my grandparents were already working on the land so it was easy for them to grab it,"" Pacitti explains.

Pacitti makes one of the best sheep pecorino cheeses in Italy. It's salty, crumbly and hard to bite with a thick outer skin. Best served with home-made fig and mulberry jam, the more seasoned it is, the tastier.

""It needs to stink of sheep,"" adds Pacitti, who also owns the valley's most prestigious dairy farm.

Another of his delicacies is Il Blu, which is a refined, pricey gorgonzola on the verge of having maggots in it, which sells at 45 euros per kilo (about $50).

At the Caciosteria, guests eat outside on wooden benches, surrounded by bull skulls hung on wooden doors to guard against ill omens. A final shot of ratafia liqueur with black cherries is the best digestif after a cheese-rich meal.

Foal carpaccio

Ciociaria is home to high-quality pecorino, pig lard and blue cheese.

Ciociaria is also home to a plethora of meat dishes.

In the nearby town of Picinisco, where Italy's most dreaded bandit, Domenico Fuoco -- akin to Robin Hood -- once used his guns to persuade rich men to give their fortunes over to the poor, young cattle breeder Davide Gargaro has opened gourmet hostaria La Taverna di Arturo.

A strong stomach might be required, though it's all a matter of overcoming stereotypes.

Extravagant dishes include baby horse carpaccio, horse salami, black pig lard (the many layers of fat make it tastier), pig cheek and neck salami, and dried sheep and goat meat sausages, known as ""misischia,"" which are traditionally stored underneath a horse's saddle.

""The animal sweat keeps them warm, ready to eat,"" says Davide, who loves his animals so much he leaves them to freely roam the hilltops and prefers to have someone else butcher them. ""They're my babies. How could I kill a six-month-old foal? I could never watch them die, but people who refuse to eat horse meat just because it's a horse commit animal discrimination.""

The meat courses are paired with a fine red bottle of Caronte, named after another legendary village outlaw who loved to rob wine barriques from greedy merchants. The nickname also refers to Dante's fiery old boatman Charon who transported sinners' souls in the inferno of ""The Divine Comedy.""

'Faith is a mini-skirt'

""Faith here is worn like a mini-skirt,"" says Picinisco priest Antonello Dionigi.

Picinisco is at the crossroad of the so-called ""triangle of faith"" where folklore mingles with legends of miracles and holy apparitions of the Virgin Mary.

""Faith here is worn like a mini-skirt,"" says the village priest Antonello Dionigi. ""It must be tight at the center, short on the loose ends and holds the mystery of life right in the middle"".

And there are ghosts too. The town's patron saint Lorenzo was said to have saved the city from Saracen invaders by creating a phantom army that chased the pirates away.

Rumor has it a group of Roman soldiers, dressed in armor and holding weapons, can be heard at night singing and partying beneath the ruins of a collapsed fortress.

The valley's revival is also courtesy of immigrant families, who fled to Scotland and the New World in search of a better life and whose heirs have now returned to their native hometowns. And with big money to invest.

They have restyled old villages like Casalattico -- an experimental mix of pink-yellow Victorian buildings, medieval alleys and Renaissance vaults.

Goat-dung spinach

Sotto le Stelle is a boutique hotel in a former abbot's palace in Picinisco.

A Scottish former lawyer, Cesidio Di Ciacca, has created a luxury resort in Picinisco, called Sotto le Stelle (Via Giustino Ferri, 1/7, Picinisco; +39 3466027120) inside an old abbot's palace.

""I was looking for a place where many descendants of immigrants like myself can come back to and call home,"" he says. ""A point of reference.""

A private helicopter from Rome can take you there. The deluxe apartments' panoramic balconies jut out of the ancient village walls, while the living-room arches were once open-air entrance doors for horse-drawn carts.

Early in the morning village grannies knock at the door and serve en-suite breakfast with tiny hand-woven baskets of fresh goat ricotta called ""fusciella."" For lunch, the concierge treats guests to a dish of wild spinach called ""orapi,"" a supreme delicacy. It's special and hard to find because it grows beneath goat dung which fertilizes it.

Bear-watching tours are organized in the national park.

The town is in constant danger of destruction by erosion and was placed on the World Monuments Watch list in 2006.

Cesidio has even brought back from the grave his ancestors' ghost hamlet and turned it into a thriving farm, I Ciacca (Via Giustino Ferri 7, Picinisco) where ancient Maturano white wine is made alongside extra virgin olive oil and transparent acacia honey.

He's hired local young staff to boost the valley's sleepy economy. Lush vegetation and moss covers rusty unhinged doors and dark rooms where bats have made their homes.

Everything seems frozen in time. You can still spot nails sticking out of ceilings where sausages were hung to dry. When Cesidio dug into the ground he discovered intriguing artifacts such as an old medal of Our Lady of Sorrows and a spoon belonging to Cesidio's grandfather.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-10/kraft-s-unsavory-option,KRAFT'S UNSAVORY OPTION,"When it came to a bid for Unilever NV, Kraft Heinz Co. retreated to its bunker within days. But according to analysts at Susquehanna, that might not last much longer.By mid-August, the six-month hiatus on the U.S. giant returning with another tilt will be over. Susquehanna estimates there's a more than 75 percent chance of Kraft coming back with a hostile bid.Two factors stand in the way of this outcome -- as much as some Unilever shareholders might want it.Firstly, Unilever's U.K.-traded shares are up 26 percent since Feb. 16, the day before Kraft's short-lived interest emerged, including a gain of as much as 2 percent Monday.That's partly due to hopes that Kraft might return. But it also reflects the fact that Unilever has announced its own plans to do some of what Kraft would have done: ramp up cost savings, lift margins and sell its spreads business.That was probably the minimum Unilever could have done. But the stock's escalation still means any bidder will have to pay significantly more this time round. Susquehanna estimates that the original $143 billion price tag could now be $200 billion, assuming a 20 percent premium.That's more for Kraft and Warren Buffett to fund. But Susquehanna believes a bid at this level would be feasible, helped by $25 billion to $35 billion of asset disposals. What's more, it reckons Unilever shareholders would be amenable to the 20 percent uplift.After all, a survey by Bernstein not long after Kraft walked away found that 53 percent of investors who identified themselves as Unilever shareholders said the Anglo-Dutch company rejected the approach too quickly, and should have engaged.But even if the numbers do stack up and Kraft can get shareholders onside, there are other barriers to Unilever falling into Kraft's hands. And they lie outside of the dealmaker's spreadsheet.Pittsburgh-based Kraft withdrew so swiftly partly because of the ferocity of the rejection from Unilever and the potential for a broader political backlash against foreign takeovers.Those factors aren't going to go away. Unilever still doesn't want to be bought by a company with a culture of aggressively cutting costs. It aspires to be measured on things other than pure profit.And if anything, with Prime Minister Theresa May weakened, and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn gaining popularity, opposition might be even greater to a deal that could risk U.K. jobs.Unilever's so-called dual-headed structure, where it has one company publicly traded in London and the other in the Netherlands, is another potential headache for Kraft.Akzo Nobel NV, the Dutch chemicals group, recently saw off a takeover approach from PPG Industries Inc., aided by a massive political backlash.Against the backdrop of activist investors targeting the consumer goods sector, with Nestle SA the latest in the line of fire, an intervention to force Unilever's hand can't be ruled out.Until then however, a successful hostile bid for Unilever looks like pie in the sky.With assistance from Chris HughesThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners."
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-illinois-budget-idUSKBN19V0BQ,BIG FINANCIAL WOES LINGER IN ILLINOIS' NEW BUDGET,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois' first budget after two years is filled with partial outlines to address its debt-ridden pension system and unpaid bill backlog -- signs that political fighting and the fiscal mess in the nation's fifth-largest state are far from over. At least 15 House and Senate Republicans broke with first-term Republican Governor Bruce Rauner on Thursday and joined with Democrats to override Rauner's vetoes of the state's first budget package in more than two years.  The $36 billion spending plan relies on a $5 billion tax increase that permanently hikes the flat personal income tax rate to 4.95 percent, up 32 percent from its prior 3.75 percent rate. To address the state's nearly $15 billion in unpaid bills, Illinois depends heavily on borrowing. Lawmakers approved $6 billion of 12-year bonds to raise money for repayments. But State Representative Greg Harris, the House Democrats' point person on the budget, has acknowledged there is only enough revenue to support half of that borrowing amount.  Illinois will also borrow up to $1.2 billion from various state accounts that have accumulated cash for specific purposes, while ""sweeping"" cash from other accounts --a government version of looking under couch cushions that is expected to yield $300 million.  Illinois' $130 billion pension liability is one of the largest in the nation, and the new budget takes only small steps to address the structural underfunding of Illinois' five retirement systems.  The new law gives the state five years to phase in changes retroactive to fiscal 2014 in actuarial or investment return assumptions made by the pension systems for an estimated savings of $892.1 million.  Seemingly small changes in projected investment results can have significant impact on a pension fund's actuarial calculations. Last year, when the Illinois Teachers' Retirement System reduced its earnings assumption to 7 percent from 7.5 percent, the change caused a $660 million spike in the state's fiscal 2018 contribution. The new budget attributes $500 million in savings to the creation of a new tier of pension beneficiaries. But that tier applies largely to newly hired employees, raising questions about how the state expects to book that savings in the current fiscal year. That estimate was lifted straight from the proposed budget presented by Rauner earlier this year. The projection has not been independently verified by legislative leaders, and Rauner's office has not responded to requests for an explanation of how the estimate was calculated.  The Illinois Education Association, one of the state's largest unions, said it has no evidence that its pensioners would be harmed by the new budget's pension provisions. But the union questioned why lawmakers approved structural changes to pensions without an independent financial analysis.  ""It's a little bit of a shot in the dark. For something this major, you'd think the legislators who are voting on this would want to know this information,"" said Jim Reed, the union's government relations director. A budget was welcomed as a positive step for Illinois, which still faces fiscal and pension crises. ""The pension pressures will continue, and Illinois' financial challenges will continue, but at least there will be a framework to recognize there's a limit to the liability growth to this state,"" said Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation, a budget watchdog group. Steve Malanga, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute think tank, said the fixes in the new budget do not match up to the challenges faced by Illinois. ""This is the kind of budget you would pass if you were a state that hit a bump in the road and had a deficit you needed to get rid of over the next two or three years,"" he said. ""It's not the kind of budget you'd pass if you have $14 billion in unpaid bills and a $130 billion unfunded (pension) liability."" The Democrats and Republicans who voted for the budget did so at least in part to prevent Illinois from becoming the first U.S. state in history to see its credit rating fall to ""junk"" status. Moody's on Wednesday put Illinois on review for a possible downgrade, but some of the state's bonds traded higher on Friday, an apparent sign of optimism about the budget.       Additional reporting by Julia Jacobs; Editing by David Greising and Sandra Maler"
http://cnn.com/2017/07/05/opinions/trump-putin-unpredictability-opinion-miller/index.html,TRUMP'S BEST DEAL WITH PUTIN: NO DEAL,"Aaron David Miller is a vice president and distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and author of ""The End of Greatness: Why America Can't Have (and Doesn't Want) Another Great President."" Miller was a Middle East negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations. Follow him @aarondmiller2 . Richard Sokolsky is a non-resident senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. From 2005-2015, he served as a member of the Secretary of State's Office of Policy Planning. The views expressed in this commentary are their own.

(CNN) With two unpredictable leaders -- Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump -- and their propensity for risk-taking, there's no way to say with certainty what will result from Friday's bilateral summit meeting on the margins of the G-20 economic summit. We're sorely tempted to conclude that the meeting, like the ""Seinfeld"" episode in which George and Jerry try to sell a TV pilot episode for a show about nothing, will turn out much the same.

But the unique mix of personalities, politics, Trump's seemingly preternatural desire to work some deal with Putin, and now the formal character of the meeting, suggest the possibility of a positive outcome that allows both leaders to claim success without resolving the core issues that divide them.

No one should be fooled by a post-summit communique that sets up working groups to deal with outstanding issues. Fundamental differences between Moscow and Washington on core issues all but guarantee that, at best, this will be a transactional and not transformational moment in the US-Russian relationship.

The world's attention is focused on the intractable North Korean problem, but the Russians have very little to offer there. There is greater basis for optimism in the Middle East, where, at least on paper, Washington and Moscow have some coincidence of interests in combatting ISIS. But even here, Trump is probably overestimating Putin's utility in this endeavor and underestimating the risks of such a partnership.

In the run-up to and for a short time after last November's presidential election, pundits speculated that Trump and Putin might try to strike a grand bargain that would resolve all the global issues dividing them -- European security, cyber warfare, Ukraine, Syria and arms control, to name only a few.

Such hopes, even before ""Russiagate"" engulfed the Trump administration, were always a pipe dream. Because of a high level of mutual mistrust, conflicting interests, objectives and values, and Putin's domestic need for an American bogeyman to maintain his popular support, it was always foolish, as one prominent expert noted , to ""imagine a world in which we suddenly under Trump's watch become partners with Russians either in Ukraine or on issues like Ukraine."" It is even crazier to believe that this summit, occurring amid the President's Russia's travails, could yield such a breakthrough.

While a grand bargain between the United States and Russia is an outlandish notion, an arrangement narrowly focused on combating global terrorism in Syria is at least imaginable. After all, at the core of Trump's aspirations for improved US-Russian relations is a coalition with Russia against ISIS to, in his words , ""knock the hell out of ISIS.""

At one point, Putin had similar visions of a coalition dancing in his head -- for example, last year, he proposed the formation of a ""broad international anti-terrorist coalition,"" not unlike the alliance between the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and other countries that defeated Adolf Hitler in World War II.

Trump's yearning to get Putin into a global coalition to hammer ISIS is well known. Putin would like nothing better than to trade that participation for a lifting of sanctions on Crimea and Ukraine. But while the President seems to have been captivated by the possibility of working with Russia against ISIS, there are several compelling reasons why that partnership has been oversold.

The United States is doing fairly well on its own in depriving ISIS of territory, oil, funding and fighters, both in Syria and Iraq, without Russian help. Indeed, the advantages of consorting with Moscow on counterterrorism have to be weighed against the disadvantages of linking the US campaign to a regime that cares little about causing indiscriminate civilian casualties and the many risks of sharing intelligence with Russia when American and Russian interests in Syria are not aligned.

America's name is blackened enough by its unwillingness to act militarily to remove Assad. Imagine how low Washington's credibility would fall if it partnered with Putin -- enabler of Assad's mass killing. Anyway, Putin has been far more interested in propping up Assad and neutralizing those Syrian opposition elements who want to get rid of him than in seriously fighting ISIS.

Far more consequential for the summit is whether the two leaders will make any headway on joint understandings and action on Syria. Putin has proven that he can manipulate a diplomatic process with the United States -- in this case the UN-sponsored Geneva talks on Syria -- as a cover to carry out Russia's narrow goals. Those goals include securing and expanding bases, blocking another use of American force to remove a regime it doesn't like, elevating Russia's status and keeping Assad in power.

Barack Obama and John Kerry acquiesced in this game largely in hopes of stopping the killing. Can you imagine how vulnerable Trump would be, given his lack of interest in Syria's future or in removing Assad, if he fell for the same gambit?

Putin will look for ways to use Trump's determination to make a deal in order to further legitimize Russia's role as America's senior partner in Syria, and to try to persuade Trump that the best way to stabilize Syria is to work with Russia -- and, by association, Assad. He may even dangle the possibility of clamping down on Assad's use of chemical weapons or a political transition to an Assad-free Syria.

Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook

Unlike the issues of Ukraine, Crimea, European security, nuclear weapons and Russian hacking, Syria, under certain circumstances, might actually represent an area of possible cooperation. But for now, a frozen conflict suits Putin well as long as he can manage Trump and continue to ensure that he never gets serious about challenging Assad, let alone trying to remove him. Putin is no fan of the Syrian dictator, whose recklessness has tried his patience on more than one occasion. But for now, Assad is still a useful asset for Moscow.

There may be some deal cut in Hamburg, and the United States could benefit from an outcome in which American and Russian interests are well served. And that's why, in the end, a summit that best serves American interests would not be a summit about something -- a summit where Trump abandons US interests and principles to make a deal -- but one, to paraphrase George and Jerry, about nothing. Indeed, whatever the author of ""The Art of the Deal"" and self-styled world's greatest negotiator believes, no deal is preferable, by far, to a bad one."
http://cnn.com/2017/07/07/europe/paris-migrants-relocation/index.html,"2,700 MIGRANTS RELOCATED FROM 'ILLEGAL' PARIS CAMPS","(CNN) More than 2,700 migrants and refugees were removed from illegal roadside camps in northern Paris on Friday.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-idUSKBN19U0S6?il=0,"BUOYED BY LOPEZ RELEASE, VENEZUELA OPPOSITION RALLIES FOR 100TH DAY","CARACAS (Reuters) - Galvanized by the release from jail of hardline leader Leopoldo Lopez, Venezuelan opposition supporters on Sunday marked 100 days of protests against a socialist government they blame for political repression and economic misery. Thousands of people gathered in an east Caracas square to hear opposition figures including the wife of Lopez, Lilian Tintori, speak. Many protests have ended in clashes between masked youths and security forces, with more than 90 killed, hundreds arrested and thousands injured since the unrest began at the start of April. ""We're not giving up. That Leopoldo is home fills us with the strength to keep fighting,"" said Maria Garcia, a 54-year-old homemaker clad in a white T-shirt bearing his image, as she gathered with friends at the rally. While Lopez was at home with his two young children, Tintori, who has campaigned for him around the world including during a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, said she was relieved to have her husband home but the fight was not over. ""I can't say I'm happy when we know our country is suffering, when there are children eating out of the trash, when there is no medicine in Venezuela,"" she said, surrounded by opposition legislators. She added that former foreign minister Delcy Rodriguez as well as her brother Jorge Rodriguez, another Socialist Party heavyweight, had escorted Lopez to his home at 3 a.m. on Saturday. Lopez, 46, was sentenced to nearly 14 years in jail on charges of inciting violence during 2014 protests against President Nicolas Maduro that led to 43 deaths. But he was surprisingly granted house arrest and sent home due to what the Supreme Court called ""irregularities"" in his case and for health reasons. Lopez looked robust, however, when he later appeared to supporters. The government seems to be calculating that his return home may ease domestic protests and international censure, but opposition leaders are viewing it as vindication of their strategy and have vowed to step up their street tactics. For more than three months, tear gas, rubber bullets, rocks and petrol bombs have flown between protesters and security forces in hotspots around the OPEC member nation. Four years of brutal recession have underpinned the protests, as millions of Venezuelans suffer food shortages, runaway inflation and long shopping lines. While foes slam him for incompetence and failed socialist policies, Maduro blames an ""economic war"" against him by pro-opposition businessmen and Washington. The opposition and government are on a political collision course this month. The opposition is organizing an unofficial referendum on Maduro next weekend, after which they are promising ""zero hour"", a presumed reference to an escalation of tactics that could include a general strike or march on the presidential palace. Maduro, in turn, is seeking to create a new super body called a Constituent Assembly, which would have powers to rewrite the constitution and dismiss the current opposition-controlled legislature, via a July 30 vote. Campaigning for the parallel assembly began on Sunday, with red-clad supporters cheering on Socialist Party leaders in Caracas. ""It's the only immediate path we Venezuelans have to overcome violence, hatred and intolerance,"" Rodriguez, the former foreign minister who is running for a seat in the constituent body, said on Sunday in a TV interview. Maduro's foes are boycotting the July 30 election, saying it is a sham designed to keep an unpopular leader in power. Editing by Alexandra Ulmer and James Dalgleish"
http://cnn.com/2017/07/10/entertainment/blac-chyna-gma-restraining-order/index.html,BLAC CHYNA GRANTED RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST ROB KARDASHIAN,"(CNN) Blac Chyna was granted a temporary restraining order barring Rob Kardashian from coming near her or posting about her online.

The reality star appeared in court Monday morning with her attorneys as she sought to stop what she alleges is cyber-bullying by Kardashian.

Kardashian posted personal information last week about his relationship with Chyna on his Instagram account, including sexually explicit images of his former fiancÃÂ©e whom he accused of cheating on him and using him for his fortune.

Outside of court, Chyna's attorney Lisa Bloom said they were granted everything they sought in their petition.

""As we have said all along, revenge porn is a form of domestic abuse,"" Bloom said. ""It is also a crime in California and 38 other states.""

Attorney Robert Shapiro represented Kardashian, who did not appear in court.

Shapiro said his client stipulated to the restraining order and agreed to follow all the conditions.

The attorney said Kardashian's concern now ""is the health and welfare of the baby and both parents are going to work toward that goal.""

""I, personally, on Mr. Kardahsian's behalf apologized and offered our regrets as to what happened in the past couple of days,"" Shapiro said. ""Now we move forward to do one thing and one thing only, what ever is in the best interest of the child.""

Chyna echoed that sentiment in a brief statement she made after the hearing.

""I'm just going to get back to co-parenting Dream,"" she said.

In the petition, Chyna, whose legal name is Angela White, alleged that Kardashian swore at her in front of her 4-year-old son, King, and got angered when she attempted to call King's father during an argument back in April.

""Rob immediately grabbed my phone and pushed me to the ground by aggressively shoving me by the side of my arm and hitting me on the side,"" the declaration read. ""I fell down from the blow to my side. I was sore and it hurt to walk.""

The next hearing in the case has been set for August 8.

Earlier the model and entrepreneur appeared on ""Good Morning America"" with Bloom in an interview which aired Monday morning before the hearing.

Chyna told ""GMA"" she was ""devastated"" by Kardashian's actions.

""Like, this is a person I trusted,"" she said. ""I just felt...betrayed.""

She denied claims she engaged with the photos by liking some of the images her ex posted, saying she has Kardashian blocked on Instagram.

She said she decided to pursue legal action after speaking with her former love with whom she shares an eight-month-old daughter, Dream.

""The moral of the story is he doesn't respect me,"" said Chyna, whose real name is Angela White. ""If you can't respect me, you have to respect the law.""

Bloom said on Friday she had filed for a temporary restraining order against Kardashian on behalf of her client.

California has laws regarding ""revenge porn"" in which a person can be charged for publicly releasing unauthorized nude images of another person to cause them emotional distress.

The former couple has had a tumultuous relationship that's been documented on both social media and their E! reality series ""Rob & Chyna.""

Things were also complicated by the fact Chyna shares a son with rapper Tyga, who left her to begin dating Kardashian's younger sister, Kylie Jenner.

On Monday's ""GMA"" appearance, Bloom defended Chyna against those who say the reality star already exposes a great deal of herself in her own social media postings.

""Any explicit photos that she may have chosen to post in the past that's her choice,"" Bloom said. ""This is like saying that a woman can't be raped if she previously chose to have sex with someone. It's her body, it's her choice,each and every time.""

Chyna said she and Kardashian split in December and there is absolutely no hope of a reconciliation. She said she has not heard from any of his family members since Kardashian's social media postings last Wednesday.

Chyna addressed speculation that she got pregnant as a revenge ploy against the Kardashians or to get money out of the reality mogul family, Chyna denied it.

""I was already Blac Chyna before the Kardsahians,"" she said."
http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/10/politics/trump-health-care-absent/index.html,TRUMP ABSENT IN FINAL HEALTH CARE SPRINT,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump has no plans to play a larger role in selling the Republican health care bill this week, an administration official told CNN Monday.

Though he often touts himself as the ultimate salesman with a knack for closing deals, he has remained tight-lipped and out of the spotlight, letting others make the last-minute push for health care reform for him.

There are no plans for Trump to travel the country to pitch the bill, the official said.

The President also has not visited Capitol Hill in hopes of cajoling dubious Republican senators who are wary to support the bill, like Vice President Mike Pence has. Instead, he's worked the phones, calling Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Dean Heller of Nevada before he headed to the G20 Summit in Germany.

He has also tweeted his encouragement.

""For years, even as a ""civilian,"" I listened as Republicans pushed the Repeal and Replace of ObamaCare. Now they finally have their chance!"" Trump tweeted Sunday.

For years, even as a ""civilian,"" I listened as Republicans pushed the Repeal and Replace of ObamaCare. Now they finally have their chance! Ã¢ÂÂ Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 9, 2017

Marc Short, Trump's legislative affairs director, said Monday that ""the President has remained very active in this debate, you will see him continue to remain so.""

But Short admitted during the off-camera briefing with reporters that ""it's a fair point"" to make that Democrats were more organized messengers for their health care bill than Republicans have been.

""There's more we could do to educate the public,"" he said.

By and large, Trump has steered clear of the tactics his predecessor used to garner support for his health care bill.

President Barack Obama was known for shedding his jacket and rolling up his sleeves as he pitched health care reform town halls. He held campaign-style rallies outside of shopping centers in Minneapolis and lead thousands in chants of ""Yes, we can.""

Obama even canceled a trip overseas just days before he was scheduled to depart because the House was expected to vote on health care in the coming days, and Democratic leaders were scrambling for votes.

With Trump not using presidential power to sell this bill -- especially with large scale events in key states -- the plan has little chance of rising from the depths of its low approval ratings. The Senate bill has just a 17% approval rating, according to a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll

""I think it comes down to the fact that he doesn't really care that much about health care,"" one Republican aide said of Trump. ""He just wants it done so he can fulfill that promise.""

""This will be great if we get it done and if we don't get it done it's going to be something that we're not going to like and that's OK and I can understand that,"" Trump recently told the senators gathered at the White House.

But it could be Trump's absence is the best move for those who hope for the legislation's passage.

The GOP aide told CNN that most senators would prefer for Trump to stay out of the health care negotiations.

""President Trump tends to complicate matters,"" the aide said. ""Honestly, I think they are happy he isn't publicly pushing for it.""

Pence hitting the road

Pence, a former congressman, has been much more involved.

He shuttles back and forth to Capitol Hill for a luncheon with Senate Republicans almost every week, and in late June, he invited several of them who were undecided over to his private residence for dinner.

The vice president is scheduled to travel to Kentucky for a listening session with those who have been negatively impacted by the Affordable Care Act this Wednesday before heading to Providence, Rhode Island, Friday to deliver a speech his aides say will focus on health care at the National Governors Association summer meeting.

In an interview with radio host Laura Ingraham Monday, Pence made another public plea on the bill's behalf.

""This week is critical, and if you want to see Congress repeal and replace Obamacare, now is the time to let your voice be heard,"" Pence said.

Pence also made the pitch for the bill during a radio interview with Rush Limbaugh Monday.

""This is the moment,"" Pence said. ""Now is the time."""

Stone said she sees parallels between King's time playing and now

(CNN) Emma Stone may be playing tennis legend Billie Jean King 40 years after King's most famous match, but the two still have something in common: a problem with gender-based pay disparity in their professions.

King sat down with Stone and Andrea Riseborough, another of the stars of the movie in which Stone is playing King, ""Battle of the Sexes,"" for an Out magazine article . The trio discussed several issues, including pay equity.

The movie follows the events of the 1973 tennis match in which King took on, and beat, Bobby Riggs, a retired player who had asserted that he there was no place for women in professional sports. It also chronicles the then-closeted King's relationship with her hairdresser Marilyn Barnett (played by Riseborough).

That same year King famously threatened to boycott the U.S. Open over pay disparity for female athletes.

Stone pointed out that while there are several factors that determine pay in Hollywood, including box office performance, there is a ""blanket issue that women, in general, are making four fifths at best.""

http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/ayutthaya-thailand-trip/index.html,"TRIP TO AYUTTHAYA, THAILAND, RECALLS GLORY DAYS OF OLD SIAM - CNN.COM","Karla Cripps, CNN Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Updated 27th June 2017

(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Filled with crumbling, camera-friendly ruins, Thailand's old capital of Ayutthaya has long been a popular Bangkok day-trip destination.

Just an hour outside of the city, this UNESCO-listed heritage site, founded in 1350, was the second Siamese capital after Sukhothai. Bustling with commerce, it was one of the world's most cosmopolitan cities, welcoming diplomats from far-flung nations.

But in 1767, 250 years ago, the Burmese moved in and demolished the kingdom, forcing inhabitants to move downriver and establish a new capital -- Bangkok

Nowadays Ayutthaya has much more to offer than a fascinating slice of Siamese history.

A recent influx of modern dining and sleeping options is tempting some to stay for the night, making it a great time to turn a visit to one of Thailand's most culturally rewarding cities into a weekend getaway.

Ruins, rivers and great seafood make this ancient capital the perfect Bangkok escape

Ayutthaya's historic highlights

Though the ruins of the former capital are spread throughout modern-day Ayutthaya province, for the sake of time most visitors tend to stick to the main island, which sits at the confluence of three rivers: Chao Phraya (which flows to Bangkok and onto the sea), Lopburi and Pa Sak.

The total area considered World Heritage property is less than three square kilometers.

""The ancient city area is not that large and one of my favorite things to do there is to rent a bicycle and explore the city that way,"" says archaeologist Noel Hidalgo Tan of the Southeast Asian Regional Centre for Archeology and Fine Art.

In terms of specific historic sites, he recommends Wat Phra Sri Sanphet (the former palace grounds) and Wat Mahathat, home to one of Thailand's most photographed relics -- a lone Buddha head emerging from the roots of a tree.

""The strangler figs are reminiscent of the trees growing on the temple ruins in Angkor,"" he says of the head.

""One can get quite close to the Buddha head but remember to be respectful, as people still worship it.""

Remains of Buddha statues can be found throughout Ayutthaya.

Next to Wat Mahathat is Wat Ratchaburana, which Tan says was recently restored by a team of Thai and German stone conservators.

""Wat Ratchaburana has heavy Khmer influences, it looks like one of the towers at Angkor Wat.""

Nearby, the majestic Wat Phra Ram was constructed on the cremation site of King Ramathibodi I, Ayutthaya's first monarch.

Wat Lokayasutharam is where you'll find another well-photographed spot -- a 42-meter-long reclining Buddha.

For those looking for more info on the city's historic sites, Ayutthaya-history.com is a great resource.

Off the main Ayutthaya island on the south bank of the Chao Phraya, the beautiful St. Joseph's Church was built in 1666.

To get a sense of the city's cosmopolitan past, Tan recommends visiting the former Portuguese, Japanese and Dutch settlements to the south of the island.

""They represent some of the early multinational presences in the region who were allowed to build settlements,"" he says.

""Some of the region's earliest churches were established here, in the Portuguese Settlement. The Portuguese legacy continued when the capital moved to Bangkok and if you sail up the Chao Phraya you still see several churches along the banks.

""The Baan Hollanda museum is another great place -- it was the former VOC (Dutch East Indies Company) building.""

Going beyond the city's role as a center of commerce, Tan says it's also compelling to consider Ayutthaya's role in the region's ongoing battles for geopolitical supremacy.

""I think many tourists might come to Ayutthaya seeing it as a former ancient 'capital' of Siam -- not just Thailand -- before the capital moved to Bangkok,"" says the archaeologist.

""But it would be interesting to understand Ayutthaya as a political power that existed contemporary to other kingdoms in medieval Southeast Asia: Angkor (Cambodia), Lan Xang (Laos), Lanna and Sukhothai (northern Thailand) and Pegu and Ava in what is now Myanmar.

""These kingdoms competed, rose and fell in reaction to each other and so in the ruins one sees the echoes of greatness, and at the same time reminders of loss in battle.""

The food

When it comes to food, Ayutthaya is famous for three things: giant river prawns, roti sai mai and boat noodles.

""So popular are Ayutthayan giant river prawns that the animal has been named the aquatic animal symbol of Ayutthaya province -- its mascot, if you want to think of it that way,"" she says.

Giant river prawns are prized for their rich, creamy, oozing tomalley and firm yet tender flesh.

""There are many dishes you can make with them from the classic tom yam or pad thai to the more elaborate dishes,"" says Punyaratabandhu.

""But what most people go for is simple grilled giant river prawns (kung phao) where fresh prawns are cooked over wood charcoal until slightly blackened on the outside and barely opaque on the inside. They're served split in half lengthwise allowing you to see (and scoop out with a spoon) the beautiful tomalley. They're pricy, but they're worth it.""

Prices range from 400-1,400 baht ($11.75-$41) depending on weight.

Roti sai mai, an old-school sweet snack, is Punyaratabandhu's personal favorite.

""Only two components -- no embellishments necessary -- make up this perennial favorite: roti, a wheat-based pastry, and sai mai (literally, 'silk threads'), caramel hand-pulled into ethereal and crystalline strands as thin as your hair,"" she says.

""Not only is roti sai mai delicious; it's fun to eat, too, because the snack always leaves the hands of the vendors unassembled; you're the one putting the two components together seconds before you're about to eat it.""

And lastly, every Ayutthaya visitor is going to want to hit up a local noodle stand for a few bowls of boat noodles.

""Boat noodles, noodles originally sold from boats, are some of the most delicious noodles Central Thailand has to offer,"" says Punyaratabandhu.

""There are multiple types of boat noodles, but the one that stands out among the rest and has come to define the entire genre, is the type redolent of dried spices with its broth dark, hearty, and slightly thickened with blood.

""Ayutthaya has some of the best boat noodles around.""

Hip new offerings

The Wine Ayutthaya.

This year, a piece of modern Ayutthaya architecture has taken a bit of the spotlight away from those historic ruins.

Opened in May, The Wine Ayutthaya -- an extension to the Grand Chaophraya Restaurant (42/1 Moo 4, Ban Run, Ayutthaya; +66 89 615 5999) -- was designed by Bangkok Project Studio and inspired by local wooden homes.

""The building was constructed to become a new tourist attraction in hopes of stimulating the economy of local communities,"" says lead architect Boonserm Premthada of the project.

A single story nine-meter high building blends in with existing large trees.

Made entirely from steel-reinforced plywood, the interior is divided into four platforms, each offering views of the river from different angles.

Another new riverside opening, Ayutthaya's The Summer House (71/1 moo 6 Koh Rean, Ayutthaya; +66 94 224 2223) is adding a modern splash to some old classics.

Located just a short drive from the city center, it's set in the owner's former family holiday home and features bright, modern decor that gives off a Swedish vibe.

Popular dishes include the Summer Roll, a buttery baked bun filled with river prawn and spicy mayo, cheese, lettuce.

Where to stay

Sala Ayutthaya's design was inspired by the area's historical ruins.

Ayutthaya is home to dozens of guesthouses and hotels, many dotting its river banks.

Among the top stays is Sala Ayutthaya , a chic boutique riverside property offering panoramic views of the Chao Phraya river and pretty Wat Phutthaisawan temple.

The design features multiple nods to the city's historic architecture, the most obvious being the liberal use of brickwork, which pairs beautifully with the hotel's stark white walls.

The pool might be small but the property's 26 modern, slick rooms are massive -- and a steal, with rooms starting from just over $100 night.

Many offer views of the river, others have their own small private pool.

There's also a small gallery showcasing photography and paintings from the area as well as a riverside restaurant with an excellent drinks menu that includes a selection of Thai-brewed craft beer.

The slow boat to Ayutthaya

Who needs roads when you've got a 100-year-old restored barge to ferry you to Ayutthaya in style.

Easy as it is to get to Ayutthaya from Bangkok by road, an overnight cruise on a restored rice barge is a far more enjoyable experience.

There's nothing quite like sitting on the open deck, drink in hand, as you watch Bangkok's densely packed riverbanks thin out to make way for open countryside -- dotted with the odd factory.

There are a few options available in Bangkok, with Anantara Dream at the top of the list.

Owned by luxury hotel brand Anantara, this 100-year-old teak barge only has two staterooms and can be booked for private return Ayutthaya journeys.

Tours are customizable but they recommend the two-night/three-day experience, offering plenty of time to explore the area.

Guests depart from the pier at the Anantara Riverside Bangkok Resort.

Bike tours

Though Ayutthaya's colorful tuk tuks are always standing by to shuttle you around, biking is a popular way to explore this compact city.

Bike rentals are widely available but for added insights we suggest booking a tour.

Among the recommended bicycle tour operators is ""The Other Side of Bangkok ,"" which recently started offering Ayutthaya excursions.

You can customize your tour depending on what you want to see/do."
http://cnn.com/2017/07/07/europe/ode-to-joy-beethoven-g20-merkel-trump/index.html,WHY MERKEL CHOSE 'ODE TO JOY' FOR G20 CONCERT,"(CNN) As the current leader of the G20, Angela Merkel gets to call the tune, and the German Chancellor appears to be sending a musical message to some of her guests in Hamburg this week.

On Friday evening, while the musicians at the Elbphilharmonie tune up and tighten strings, some of the world's most powerful men and women will settle into their seats for a performance of Ludwig van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony

While they will have traded the conference room for the concert hall, the day's politicking will continue.

A German government spokesman told CNN that Merkel herself selected the Ninth Symphony (""a substantial part of German culture""), whose final movement, better known as the ""Ode to Joy,"" is ""a hymn to humanity, peace and international understanding.""

After US President Donald Trump's first trip to Europe in May, is Merkel trying to make nice with music? Or is she looking to score points off a man who has previously conceded that symphonies aren't really his thing?

""I have to admit that my knowledge of classical music is limited,"" Trump wrote in his 2004 book ""How to Get Rich.""

Idealistic vision of unity

Completed in 1824, Beethoven's final symphony sets the idealistic words of German poet Friedrich Schiller to music; together, they look forward to a time of joyful unity, when ""All people become brothers.""

""The piece was written ... at a time of repression and counter-revolution,"" says Nicholas Baragwanath, head of the music department at the UK's University of Nottingham. ""The [French] Revolution, this great experiment, had failed and it was a police state, effectively.""

Given the troubled times it was created in, the symphony has long been seen as ""a cry for freedom,"" Baragwanath says.

But John Deathridge, emeritus professor of music at Kings College London, says the original poem was toned down to make it less revolutionary: ""In the original, it has the line 'Beggars become princes' brothers,' suggesting all levels of society come together. That becomes ... more abstract.""

The Ninth Symphony was Ludwig van Beethoven' final major work -- the composer was deaf by the time it was completed.

And he says ""the idea that Beethoven was a democrat,"" using his music to argue that power should be in the hands of the people, is ""rubbish.""

""He believed in a kind of benign authoritarianism,"" Deathridge says. ""He was a monarchist at the end of the day. He wanted everyone together, but not in the democratic spirit as we think of it today.""

Music used for political ends

Whatever Beethoven's original intentions, the 150-plus years since the Ninth Symphony's debut have seen it Ã¢ÂÂ and in particular the ""Ode to Joy"" Ã¢ÂÂ co-opted by a string of political causes, some of which would be considered far from utopian today.

""Few great works of art have spent so much time with such unappealing people,"" wrote music and arts critic Igor Toronyi-Lalic n The Times in 2009 . ""For much of its history, the ode has been a companion to the most murky and murderous of political extremes.""

JUST WATCHED Trump attacks media ahead of G20 summit Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump attacks media ahead of G20 summit 02:20

That, says Deathridge, is both the work's genius and its weakness: ""It creates this empty space that you can put all sorts of things into. You can interpret the desire for unity as something authoritarian, or as a protest against authoritarianism.""

The piece has also been used at times of great celebration in Germany. During the early part of the Cold War (from 1956 to 1968) ""Ode to Joy"" was the de facto anthem of the combined East and West German teams at the Olympic Games.

Since the 1970s, ""Ode to Joy"" has also been the anthem of what is now the European Union , chosen because it ""expresses the European ideals of freedom, peace and solidarity.""

UK Prime Minister Theresa May, currently negotiating the terms of Britain's departure from the EU, may also be uncomfortable in her seat at such a celebration of European unity Ã¢ÂÂ some Scottish MPs have used the tune as a means of protesting Brexit

Apt choice of music?

US President Donald Trump's music taste favors crooners over classical tunes.

So when conductor Kent Nagano taps his baton to signal the start of the performance, will Trump be in the auditorium? A recital of the Ninth Symphony typically lasts for over an hour, and its best-known section, the ""Ode to Joy,"" comes at final movement.

Given the US President's infamously short attention span , the idea of him sitting through the whole concert is ""extraordinary,"" says John Deathridge. ""Perhaps he'll come late.""

JUST WATCHED 'Zombies' march through G20 summit city Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 'Zombies' march through G20 summit city 00:47

It would be a shame for him to miss it, says Deathridge, insisting it is a very apt piece of music for Trump.

""I think there is actually something fitting about the choice,"" he says. ""Donald Trump is behaving like a monarch ... it's like going backwards to monarchical times when leaders had absolutely no conscience, so in a way it is a very suitable piece for him.""

But if Merkel's US visitor doesn't enjoy his evening's entertainment, Trump's own history suggests he won't hesitate to show his displeasure.

""In the second grade ... I punched my music teacher because I didn't think he knew anything about music,"" Trump claimed in ""The Art of the Deal,"" his 1987 book. ""The difference now is that I like to use my brain instead of my fists."""
http://cnn.com/2017/07/10/africa/seychelles-climate-change-coral/index.html,CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE UNEASY FUTURE OF SEYCHELLES,"Thanks to climate change, the ocean is no longer a friend of Seychelles. But can its reefs offer this embattled nation a lifeline?

(CNN) In 1998, the cruel heat of El Nino hit Seychelles hard. Sea surface temperatures rose around the Indian Ocean, bleaching 90% of coral reefs in the archipelago. Widespread flooding caused significant economic losses -- fishing and agriculture accounting for more than half of the total figure according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

The meteorological event, a combination of ocean heat redistribution and wind reversal in the Pacific, occurs approximately every two to seven years and has far-reaching consequences. The last El Nino in 2016 was similarly dreadful, reducing coral coverage on Seychelles' reefs from 50% to 5%, say local researchers.

El Nino is a phenomenon: a devastating, uncontrollable exception to the norm. With carefully managed conservation, Seychelles can survive its wild fluctuations. But not if global warming continues. As baseline temperatures creep up, the ecosystem loses its ability to recover. Eventually El Nino could prove terminal.

Climate change has become the day-to-day struggle for this tiny nation -- an island nation that faces erasure should the problem remain uncurbed.So what can a country with one of the smallest GDPs in the world do to prevent the global catastrophe lapping at its shores?

A survey of the threats

Headlines refer to the ""slow creep"" of climate change. In pockets of the world not yet on its frontlines, there is still doubt or ambivalence -- even from the highest offices in the land . Seychellois, however, can measure the effects with a yardstick along their coastline.

""People that don't believe in climate change, maybe they need to come to the Seychelles,"" says Lisa Laporte Booyse, who runs a guesthouse on the southeast tip of Mahe, the largest island in the chain.

""We can show them photos of things that were very different before ... coastal erosion. We can see flooding that we never experienced, the higher temperatures that we've never experienced before. The season(al) changes that have had an effect.""

""Before, we literally could tell you the day that our rainy season would start. Now, we have droughts that we never experienced before.""

Bleached coral close to the coast. Coral coverage dropped from 50% to 5% on reefs in 2016.



The IMF cites 2010 as Seychelles' ""worst drought in decades,"" also noting that in January 2013 intense rain caused landslides in Pointe Au Sel, and in May 2007 extreme high tides spread 164 feet inland, striking roads and infrastructure. Locals are being forced to create ad hoc barriers from rocks to prevent beaches from being washed away.

So much of the affairs on land are dictated by the health of the biosphere in the water.

When it comes to coastal erosion, reefs are key, acting as a wave breaker protecting the shoreline, explains Savi Leblond, project leader at the Cerf Island Conservation Program, 2.5 miles off the coast of Mahe. Without strong reefs, the land is at the mercy of the ocean. At present, they are delicately poised.

""Our reefs here have been under several threats -- natural and anthropogenic,"" Leblond says.

Sea surface temperature rises cause ""stress"" to corals, which release an algae zooxanthellae, which makes up ""90% of its food source, as well as its color."" The result is bleaching and depleted nourishment. Bleaching is reversible, but if waters remain too warm for too long, coral starves and dies.

JUST WATCHED Seychelles: 115 islands vs climate change Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Seychelles: 115 islands vs climate change 07:52

Another factor is ocean acidification, caused by bodies of water absorbing C02 -- 560 billion tons in the past 250 years, per one US national climate assessment . This has increased ocean surface acidity by 30%, preventing calcifying life forms, including coral, from absorbing the nutrients necessary for them to maintain their structure.

Then there is sedimentation, which starves coral of oxygen. The Max Planck Institute describes this, paired with acidification, as a recipe for a ""deadly chain reaction"" on reefs. Sedimentation can occur due to extreme weather events -- the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami covered some reefs in Seychelles -- but sediment can also travel via rain runoff and flood waters, caused by storm surges and rising sea levels.

A turtle swims among bleached coral in Seychelles.



Seychelles is particularly susceptible to rising seas. Many islands in the 115-strong archipelago are low-lying elevated reefs. Of the archipelago's combined land area, roughly two and a half times the size of Washington DC, 16.4% is less than 16 feet above sea level.

By 2100, the United States' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts average global sea levels could rise over eight feet

Meanwhile, a paper dated March 2016 suggested ice melt in Antarctica alone could add 49 feet to sea levels by 2500

Either of these eventualities would be a catastrophe for Seychelles' biosphere -- above and below water.

""When corals die off, unfortunately we die off,"" surmises Leblond. ""Everything relies on coral reefs.""

Custodians of the ocean

""It was the fishermen who said it's not like it was before,"" recalls Booyse.

Seychellois look to the sea for sustenance; they're custodians of over 500,000 square miles of ocean, and 15% of the population are engaged in fishing and fishing-related activities. But it's already proving harder for fisherman like Augustin Desaubin and others to eek out a living.

JUST WATCHED After the storm: How to rebuild a coral reef Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH After the storm: How to rebuild a coral reef 07:39

As a boy Desaubin remembers ""the corals were beautiful; plenty of coral inside the reef, plenty of fish,"" he adds. ""Now we can see only seaweed.""

""When I was young, octopus was abundant. I (would) dive for about one hour, you'd have five or six octopus and go home."" Now approaching 50, Desaubin says there are days when he returns empty-handed.

""Corals cover less than 0.1% of the world's surface area but they house over 25% of the world's biodiversity,"" Leblond explains.

If coral degradation continues, it's not just the tourist industry that will suffer. But while some nations haver in their commitment to fighting climate change, Seychelles is ramping up its efforts.

Rebuilding the ocean from the floor up

Four years before the Kyoto Protocol (a precursor to the Paris Climate Accord) was signed, Seychelles placed the environment front and center of policy. Its constitution , penned 1993, begins as follows:

""We, the People of Seychelles, grateful to Almighty God that we inhabit one of the most beautiful countries in the world; ever mindful of the uniqueness and fragility of Seychelles... declar(e) our unswaying commitment... (to) help preserve a safe, healthy and functioning environment for ourselves and for posterity.""

By January 2017 the IMF declared that ""Seychelles has put climate change at the center of its sustainable development strategy, more purposefully than most other small states.""

JUST WATCHED The Seychelles is making a difference Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The Seychelles is making a difference 06:52

Alongside government initiatives, citizens are taking action.

""We grow corals in a nursery and use these nursery-grown corals to rehabilitate the reef,"" explains marine scientist Jude Bijoux. Due to climate change, only corals most resilient to warm temperatures are selected, he adds.

The time-consuming process involves transferring coral fragments from one of five artificial reefs to rope lines, then to substrate or natural rock on the sea floor. It's a six to 12-month effort requiring epoxy resin and regular rope cleaning with a toothbrush.

""It's a bit weird,"" says Leblond, but their methods give coral ""the best chance they have.""

Rope-grown corals are tended to as part of reef rehabilitation.



Inspired by initiatives on Cerf, Booyse started the Anse Forbans Community Conservation Program, a group of neighbors setting up a coral nursery of their own.

""(It) won't be an immediate fix,"" Booyse says. ""We're looking at a five-year lifespan to get the corals healthy, growing again and plant them back.""

Even among one of the greenest societies in the world, ownership and responsibility lie at the heart of Booyse's motives. ""My own generation, and generations before, have made a big impact on the environment,"" she says. ""I have to try and lead and make a difference.""

""When you're fighting the cause you've just got to go and keep going.""

Seychellois know that in the fight against climate change, no half-measures will do. Their livelihoods and homes depend on it."

And this is my wallets savings.Hidden identities are a popular feature of the twilight world of virtual money. Now that the total value of cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin and ether, soared June 6 to more than $100 billion, approaching the market value of McDonalds Corp., concerned regulators say it might be time to link wallet IDs with actual humans.  Secrecy persists from the days, earlier this decade, when Ross Ulbricht, going by the nom de guerre Dread Pirate Roberts, used bitcoin to launder money and traffic in narcotics, activities for which he started serving a life term at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York.Thats not to say that 0x00A651D43B6e209F5Ada45A35F92EFC0De3A5184 or any other entities are doing anything illegal. But opacity may be worsening jagged price movements. The value of ether, for example, rose from about $8 a unit at the start of the year to crest at $400 in June before settling around $250 today. A lack of transparency could also be stifling the mainstreaming of online money, according to draft legislation issued by the European Parliament in March.The credibility of virtual currencies will not rise if they are used for criminal purposes, the draft said. In this context, anonymity will become more a hindrance than an asset for virtual currencies and their potential future popularity.Pseudonymity has always been a big part of the markets allure. Upending traditional ways of doing business was the lodestar for Ethereums inventor, 23-year-old Vitalik Buterin. He released his software in 2015, not long after dropping out of Canadas University of Waterloo.One of its more important features is that you dont have identities tied to this, said Spencer Bogart, head of research at venture firm Blockchain Capital. This financial privacy is an important characteristic.Ether, the second-most-popular cryptocurrency after bitcoin, is used to pay for applications or programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain, a secured list of transactions that can be shared. That allows for the use of smart contracts, or pieces of computer code that make the terms of such agreements operate automatically. The blockchain has the potential to reshape business and finance by enabling immediate settlements of activities such as bank transfers and securities trades.JPMorgan Chase & Co., BP Plc, Microsoft Corp. and ING Groep NV are among those experimenting with it.The current value of all the ether held, $23 billion, means dozens of electronic wallets have accrued nine-figure positions. Many of them could be held by individuals, according to a Bloomberg analysis. Individuals can hold multiple wallets.Likely candidates to be crypto-billionaires include hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz, Joseph Lubin, founder of ConsenSys, a blockchain production studio that works on Ethereum, and Ethereum creator Buterin.Novogratz, a former executive at Fortress Investment Group and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., has a long way to go, but hes been a consistent booster. He said last month that he has 10 percent of his net worth invested in virtual money. Thats a stake worth at least $90 million, given a net worth calculated at $925 million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Novogratz declined to comment.Cryptocurrencies could become a $5 trillion industry, but they need to develop sound business principles to satisfy regulators and lend legitimacy, Novogratz said June 27 at a fintech conference in New York.Lubin, the former chief operating officer for Ethereum Switzerland GmbH, which developed the software, could hold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ether, several investors said. The Canadian entrepreneur didnt respond to requests for comment on his holdings.The long-range vision is moving the fundamental transactional elements of our society from analog, friction-filled systems to natively digital frictionless systems, Lubin told Bloomberg Radio June 21.Buterin said in a Reddit post last month his ether holdings equal what would amount to about $117 million today, according to calculations by Bloomberg.Like bitcoin, ether is struggling to overcome a reputation sullied by cyberattacks and technology bottlenecks. A flash crash last month saw the price of the cryptocurrency tumble to just 10 cents before rebounding to about $300.A lot of lessons will be learned, said Peter Denious, head of global venture capital at Aberdeen Asset Management in Stamford, Connecticut. A lot of money will be lost before a lot of money can be made.0x00A651D43B6e209F5Ada45A35F92EFC0De3A5184 couldnt be reached for further comment."
http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/07/smallbusiness/india-green-stoves-ankit-mathur/index.html,THE YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR BRINGING CLEANER AIR TO INDIA'S VILLAGES,"When he started his business six years ago, Ankit Mathur wanted to improve the lives of India's 900 million villagers, and do something about the country's filthy air.

Now, through their firm Greenway Grameen Infra, Mathur and his co-founder Neha Juneja are doing both -- by changing the way rural Indians cook, one household at a time.

""We started out with the idea that we will make products for the rural market,"" Mathur told CNNMoney.

Nearly 70% of Indian homes cook with primitive mud stoves that burn firewood or cow dung, exposing families to harmful smoke and diseases in one of the most polluted countries on the planet.

Greenway's cooking stove offers a solution. The aluminum and steel contraption uses much less wood than a traditional mud stove, and produces far less harmful smoke in the process.

""We designed a cook stove that cuts down fuel consumption to a third of what a mud stove uses and reduces emissions to one quarter of what they are,"" Mathur said.

Related: The battle to buy a smog mask in India's pollution-choked capital

Switching to a cleaner stove is a no-brainer for environmental conservationists, but the 32-year old entrepreneur's biggest challenge was convincing rural families that they needed it.

""We wanted to sell the stove more than the customers wanted the stove,"" he said.

The company's initial sales pitch on the product's health and environment benefits fell flat. So they changed tack.

""It looks good, your kitchen will be a lot better when you have it, you will have a lot more time on your hands... you will collect less wood,"" Mathur said, listing the arguments that ultimately convinced users to shell out between 1,800 rupees ($30) and 3,000 rupees ($50) for a Greenway stove.

Around 550,000 people have now bought a stove, bringing the firm $9 million in sales.

""It sounds like a lot, but if you look at the Indian numbers there are more than 100 million households we can reach out to,"" said Mathur.

He's aiming to place the stoves in at least 10 million homes within the next few years.

The company has also started selling solar-powered lamps, and is working on a cheap TV antenna for rural use.

Greenway's rise reflects the huge opportunity for green business in India.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is aiming to step up the fight against climate change after President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the landmark Paris accord last month.

Modi has set ambitious renewable energy targets and even pledged to sell only electric cars by 2030.

""India is a large market and it's growing faster than most other large markets,"" Mathur said. ""We find it exciting to find a niche for ourselves."""

(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ On the night of June 30, 1997, Hong Kong was preparing to enter a new historic chapter.

Thousands of Chinese troops arrived in Hong Kong, as the British lowered its flag. The occasion? A day later, the United Kingdom returned the territory to Chinese sovereignty after more than 150 years of British rule in what's now known as "" the Handover.

Some Hong Kong citizens marched in protest. Others emigrated in fear. Many toasted to a new beginning.

One of the night's biggest parties was at Carnegie's -- a late-night institution in Hong Kong that played host to many a wild night, but sadly closed its doors this June after 23 years in business.

Colonial-era restaurants and bars are indeed a rare breed these days, but travelers can still get a sense of British-era Hong Kong at these seven time-honored favorites:

The Peninsula Lobby

Walk into The Peninsula hotel's lobby on any given day of the week, and you'll see lines around the palatial space, as people from all over the world queue up for the famous Afternoon Tea.

It's a long-time tradition at The Peninsula, a colonial hotel that opened in 1928 during British rule -- making it the oldest luxury hotel in Hong Kong.

""Life seemed to have a different pace back then,"" Florian Trento, executive chef at the Peninsula Hong Kong, tells CNN. ""No one had mobile phones and people were always talking with each other. People had time to chat over a meal, which was the center of social life.""

Trento has worked at The Peninsula since 1987 and remembers working late that rainy handover night, as the hotel prepared special menus to be enjoyed before the July 1 fireworks.

""There was a level of uncertainty that night but, generally, the city was in a somber mood,"" he says. ""Of course things have changed -- we're all 20 years older! Life has always been good. It is less quiet now and we have social media, so people interact less, but life is good in Hong Kong.""

The Globe

For city newcomers, The Globe is likely most appreciated for its amazing craft beer selection. But for old-timers, the bar recalls days gone by, when it was Central's favorite neighborhood hangout.

The British pub opened in 1995 along Hollywood Road, conveniently located next to Hong Kong's famous Mid-Levels Escalator. In its heyday, Belgian actor Jean Claude Van Damme paid the bar a visit, as did Aussie tennis star Pat Cash and former English rugby player Jason Leonard.

After nearly 15 years in the original location, the landlord doubled the rent. So The Globe took up a new home, just off Hollywood Road in 2009.

""We tried to bring as much of the old Globe with as we could -- the painted Globe map is still on the wall, the old round tables and overly high bar stools are still around,"" explains Toby Cooper, The Globe's director.

Cooper even salvaged the old floorboards, creating the tables for the booths. Today, the place feels like a proper British gastropub, with picnic tables, dozens of taps and even a lounge for games. The best time to visit? Happy hour, of course, which is pretty much all day -- from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.

Jimmy's Kitchen

If you're looking for old school favorites such as Baked Alaska, British bangers and mash, and ""Steak Diane"" -- juicy steak flambÃÂ©ed tableside -- Jimmy's Kitchen is a go-to Hong Kong institution.

The Old World diner opened in 1928 -- first in the Wan Chai district -- and later moved to Tsim Sha Tsui (now closed) in 1969. In 1975, Jimmy's opened another location on Wyndham Street, which still stands.

Today, the heritage restaurant still oozes with nostalgic charm, from the wood-paneling, velvet furniture and rich red carpets. The menu stays true to its original signatures -- think international fare and steaks that are prepared with a high-heat broiler, leaving the exterior nice and crispy.

The Verandah

The Verandah is located inside Hong Kong's historic Repulse Bay estate.

Down on the Southside of Hong Kong Island -- about 30 minutes from Central -- The Verandah restaurant is a posh dining destination, inside the historic Repulse Bay estate.

In its heyday, the building served as a celebrated hotel (from 1920 to 1982) that once welcomed the likes of Ernest Hemingway and Marlon Brando. The building was demolished in 1982, but quickly rebuilt to capture its earlier grandeur.

Now a lofty residential development, The Repulse has all the trappings of the 1920s, complete with black-and-white tile floors, grand staircases and antique wooden fixtures. And visitors can still enjoy afternoon tea or an elegant European meal at The Verandah, which offers views of the South China Sea, a colonial-era atmosphere and live piano music.

Curious about the building's story? There are mini historical exhibits peppered throughout the lobby and restaurants.

The Peak Lookout

On the top of Hong Kong's most famous mountain, The Peak Lookout has stood the test of time -- opening back in 1947, first known as the Peak CafÃÂ©. The restaurant is housed inside a renovated Grade II historic building -- formerly used as a resting place for ""sedan chair"" carriers.

Back then, the only way to reach the houses at the top of the mountain was to be carried up like a king, and this was where the sedan carriers would rest between treks. Over the years, the restaurant has earned a reputation for serving excellent oysters and barbecue, Indian and Hainan chicken ... a bit of everything, really.

It became the Peak Lookout in 2001 following renovations and an ownership change . The courtyard seating is especially charming, with a garden setting and views over Hong Kong's southern side. Meanwhile, inside, gorgeous arched doorways and stone walls lend a rustic feel and the nostalgic black-and-white photos on the walls will walk you through history.

La Taverna

Hong Kong's very first Italian restaurant is none other than La Taverna, which emerged on the scene in 1969.

Opened by two Milanese brothers, the restaurant was a social gathering place for the small Italian community, at the time nostalgic for handmade noodles and quality olive oil.

Though La Taverna had half-a-dozen locations at one time, the only one that remains is in Tsim Sha Tsui, where the facade looks as if it's been transported from Milan's cobbled streets. Dating back to 1973, the eatery is cozy and rustic, featuring thick wood beams, antique furniture and vintage copper pots that dangle from the ceiling.

As for the menu? This is the kind of place to order rich and indulgent Italian favorites, such as Milanese osso buco with risotto or wood-fired pizza.

Captain's Bar

The Captain's Bar has been an after-work hotspot for decades.

The Mandarin Oriental, Hong Kong is one of the city's most famous hotels and it's not surprising that it's also home to an old-school watering hole.

The Captain's Bar has long drawn a well-heeled after-work crowd, since opening 50 years ago.

The surroundings have been updated for wear and tear, but the place retains a gentleman's club vibe -- picture leather booths, red accents and wood fixtures. The best part about drinking here is the signature Captain's Bar Beer. Brewed by local outfit Young Master Brewery, it's served in chilled silver tankards, for a nostalgic flair.

The bar is also known for its excellent Indian food -- especially the chicken tikka -- and live jazz on weekends.

The FCC

Housed in a 19-century heritage building in the heart of Hong Kong's Central district, The Foreign Correspondents' Club has been the choice watering hole for journalists since it opened in 1949.

The club has changed locations several times, finally making its way to its current address -- a beautiful brick-and-stucco building that was once an ""ice house,"" used to store dairy products before refrigerators were common.

A walk through the main bar, which is generally jam-packed on Friday nights, is like stepping back in time. Iconic magazine covers and emotive war images decorate the walls, a tribute to the work of its brave members. While visitors need to know -- or befriend -- a member to get inside this popular spot, the next-door Fringe Club shares a bit of the same heritage appeal.

Opened in 1983, the art-gallery-slash-cafe puts on a host of exhibitions and theater performances throughout the year. Or for a low-key evening, head to the rooftop bar.

The United States, Russia and Jordan announced a ceasefire and ""de-escalation agreement"" for the southwest on Friday and starting on Sunday after a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg. ""The agreement can be fruitful if it is expanded to all of Syria and includes all the area that we discussed in Astana talks for de-escalating the tension,"" Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency. In Astana peace talks, Russia, Turkey and Iran tried to finalize an agreement on creating four de-escalation zones in Syria but failed to reach an agreement. Russia and Iran are the main international backers of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad while Washington supports some of the rebel groups fighting to topple him. ""Iran is seeking Syria's sovereignty and security so a ceasefire cannot be limited to a certain location...No agreement would be successful without taking the realities on the ground into account,"" Qasemi added. Previous similar ceasefires have failed to hold for long and it was not clear how much the actual combatants -- Assad's government forces and the main Syrian rebel armies in the southwest -- are committed to this latest effort.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/10/news/economy/brexit-cost-breakfast-eu/index.html?section=money_topstories,BREXIT MEANS PAYING MORE FOR BREAKFAST,"Brexit could make breakfast a lot more expensive.

The price of classic ""full English"" breakfast could spike by nearly 13% if Britain crashes out of the European Union, according to accounting firm KPMG.

Failing to agree a new trade relationship before leaving the EU in March 2019 would force the U.K. to trade under rules set by the World Trade Organization.

""If the U.K. leaves the EU without a trade deal or transitional agreement, we can expect both higher prices and a huge spike in red tape at the borders,"" said KPMG executive Bob Jones.

A full English breakfast typically includes toast, bacon, sausages, eggs, hash browns, tomatoes, mushrooms and baked beans, although other items are sometimes included.

KPMG said orange juice and olive oil would be the two fry-up ingredients with biggest price increase under the WTO tariffs, with the price of imported juice going up 34% and oil by 30%.

The cost of milk, eggs and bread would stay the same because they can be easily sourced from the U.K.

The research illustrates how even basic ingredients involve complex supply chains, making them pricier as tariffs accumulate.

Juice is bottled in Ireland from oranges grown in Spain, while beans are imported from the U.S. and cooked in Italy before being brought into the U.K.

Related: It's official. Business isn't investing in Britain.

The price of many staple ingredients is already higher because of the sharp fall in the value of the pound, which has declined 14% against the dollar since the referendum last June.

The weaker pound makes imports more expensive, helping to push inflation to a four-year high of 2.9% in May.

Higher breakfast costs weren't the only piece of negative Brexit news on Monday.

Data released by Visa showed that consumer spending in the U.K. fell for the second month in a row in June, rounding off the worst quarter since 2013.

As the price of essential food items grows, households are being forced to cut spending elsewhere.

""Spend on food and drink grew by nearly 2%, while household goods suffered from a substantial drop as consumers cut back on big ticket furniture and homewares,"" said Kevin Jenkins, managing director at Visa.

Related: Is the U.K. headed for a recession?

It's not just the consumers who are feeling the pain.

Businesses are suffering because of uncertainty surrounding the future relationship between the U.K. and its biggest trading partner.

A survey of chief financial officers done by Deloitte showed 72% think the business environment will be worse when the U.K. leaves the EU.

That's up from 60% in the previous quarter and the highest share since the referendum."
http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/newgrange-ireland-stone-age/index.html,"NEWGRANGE, IRELAND: MARVEL AT STONE AGE PASSAGE TOMB - CNN.COM","Maureen O'Hare, CNN Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Updated 6th July 2017

(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ ""It's a real sharing experience, to be in the dark waiting for the light,"" says Clare Tuffy, manager of BrÃÂº na BÃÂ³inne Visitor Centre in Ireland's Boyne Valley.

Last year, nearly 33,000 people applied by lottery for entry to the Newgrange passage tomb on the mornings surrounding the winter solstice.

Only 60 were chosen.

On the days between December 19 and 23, in a spectacular feat of Stone Age engineering, a dawn sunbeam strikes through the ""roofbox"" opening above the tomb's entrance, then creeps along the 19-meter passageway, to where a hushed group of visitors stand waiting in the blackness of the innermost chamber.

For around 17 minutes -- weather permitting -- the chamber is flooded with light.

""There are very few experiences you can share across five millennia, with your ancestors,"" Tuffy tells CNN Travel. ""5,000 years ago, people were waiting in the exact same spot, for the same event.""

Ireland's Ancient East

Hailed by UNESCO as ""Europe's largest and most important concentration of prehistoric megalithic art,"" the World Heritage Site of BrÃÂº na BÃÂ³inne lies less than an hour's drive north of Dublin, in the heart of what the country's tourism board has dubbed Ireland's Ancient East.

Here, three large burial mounds -- Newgrange, Knowth and Dowth -- and around 40 satellite passage graves lie in the rich, green hills of County Meath.

The valley is as fertile now as when the monuments were built using tools of stone, bone and wood by a farming community in 3,200 BCE, some 500 years before the great pyramids of Giza.

Newgrange is the most famous.

This grass-covered, quartz-ringed hump, some 86 meters across and 13.5 meters high, covers an acre of land. Its smooth exterior belies the mysterious hidden chambers within; only a fraction are open to the public.

Eternal house of the dead

The solar aligned roofbox above the entrance is unique to Newgrange.

These communal passage tombs proliferated across western Europe in the Neolithic era, linking the ancient communities with immortality.

""Their own houses would be very simple, ephemeral things of wood and clay, so for the dead they built houses that would last forever,"" Tuffy says.

Examples today include Gavrinis in France, Maeshowe in Scotland and Bryn Celli Ddu in Wales.

""As they got more and more sophisticated, they included the solar alignments,"" says Tuffy. They grew in scope also. In their day, they would most likely have been the largest monuments in the world. But there's a reason UNESCO says that the passage grave is ""brought to its finest expression"" in the Boyne Valley.

""About 12% of passage tombs have a significant solar alignment,"" explains Tuffy. ""But Newgrange is unique in that it is the only one that has a special opening to allow the sun to enter.""

Temple, tomb and town center

""We think for the people who built it, it was far more than just a tomb,"" explains Tuffy. The monuments had social, economic, religious and funerary functions.

""It would have been a place where people gathered, it would have been a place where the ancestors were honored. It is a symbol of the people's wealth, and it is a place probably where they interceded between the living and the dead.""

Many of the 97 boulders -- or ""kerbstones"" -- that ring Newgrange are decorated with obscure carvings of spirals, circles, zigzags and triangles, which may have astronomical as well as religious significance.

in his 2012 book, ""Newgrange, Monument to Immortality,"" Irish journalist Anthony Murphy argues that the Newgrange and Knowth were enormous calendars used by the Neolithic farmers to measure years, leap years and more.

After the Stone Age

Newgrange is better known, but Knowth has more layers of history to explore.

""Eventually the building was such a drain on the resources of the community that they stopped building them,"" says Tuffy. ""New ideas came to Ireland with bronze. We began to see shiny gold metal, and we all wanted to be buried in individual graves, and be buried with the good stuff. So the whole tradition changed. The monuments then were abandoned, but still honored.""

Newgrange was sealed after its original use had come to an end.

It remained so until the passage and chamber were rediscovered in 1699 by one of William of Orange's men, nine years after the Dutch Protestant William of Orange's forces defeated those of King James II of England at the history-defining Battle of the Boyne.

The white quartz exterior was added in the 1970s.

While the artifacts unearthed in the Newgrange group are purely prehistoric, there are ""far more layers of activity"" at the Knowth group of 30 monuments, says Tuffy, which has features dating from the Neolithic period to the Middle Ages.

The Hill of Tara archaeological complex, ancient seat of the High Kings of Ireland and used from the Neolithic period to the 12th century, is a short distance away beside the River Boyne and can be combined with a day trip to BrÃÂº na BÃÂ³inne.

When to visit

On July 1, 2017 World Heritage Ireland introduced free entry for the under-12s to all of its heritage sites, including BrÃÂº na BÃÂ³inne. While summer is the busiest period, Tuffy reckons the best time to visit is off-season.

""In the autumn and winter months, the monuments stand out far more in the landscape and they're far more imposing, because all the vegetation around them falls away.""

Access to the moments is via guided tour only, and visitors are capped at 150,000 a year. Entrance fees range from 4 euros ($4.50) for entry to the visitor center to 13 euros ($14.70) for entry to the center and to Newgrange and Knowth.

You can apply by post for the Solstice 2017 lottery or fill in a form at the visitor center. This year's draw takes place on September 29.

Although only a lucky few get inside, crowds of several hundred gather outside the tomb on those special winter days.

""It's always wonderful to be at Newgrange whether you're inside in the chamber waiting for the sunbeam or whether you're on the outside,"" says Tuffy.

""It makes you think about life and death and rebirth and about our place in the world and about continuity. It's certainly a better way to pass those days before Christmas than out shopping.""

The company said on Monday it delivered about 47,100 electric sedans and SUVs in the first half of 2017, at the lower end of its own forecasts, putting pressure on the company's shares. Tesla had then not provided details on the number of vehicles in transit. The company, which blamed ""severe shortfall"" of new battery packs that constrained vehicle manufacturing until June, reiterated on Friday that combined deliveries of Model S and Model X in the second half of 2017 will likely exceed deliveries in the first half. Registrations of Tesla vehicles in California fell 24 percent in April from a year earlier, according to data from industry consultant IHS Markit.  The numbers come as investors worry that demand for Tesla's luxury Model S sedan is waning ahead of the mass market Model 3 launch. Tesla's shares, which spiked after the transit number announcement, gave up their gains to trade up 1.2 percent at $312.51.

Zarooq Motors claims to be Dubai's first supercar manufacturer.

A price tag of $450,000.

(CNN) Zarooq is the Arabic name for the fastest snake in the desert. It's also the manufacturer of a new off-road supercar from Dubai -- the first of its kind from the Emirates.

The Sandracer 500GT, designed by Zarooq Motors, aspires to both the luxury of a Lamborghini and the capabilities of a hardened dune racer. Its specifications appear to back up that claim: a 6.2-liter V8 engine capable of 525 bhp, paired with a carbon fiber body and built in roll cage, means the 2,645-lb 500GT will go from 0-60 mph in under four seconds.

So can this vehicle signal the dawn of a new kind of super off-roader?

A city obsessed with supercars

Zarooq Motors claims to be the first Emirati car manufacturer, with Mohammed Al Qadi, one of the founders, at the helm of the company. He's been involved in motorsports for over 15 years and headed up the Yas Marina Formula One circuit in Abu Dhabi."
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-10/tesla-rolls-out-its-first-model-3-and-it-s-elon-s,"TESLA ROLLS OUT ITS FIRST MODEL 3, AND ITS ELONS","Its finally here: The Model 3, Teslas $35,000 electric gamechanger. A single black Model 3 rolled off the production line Friday with a serial number all its own, kicking off a company-defining six months. The car will belong to Elon Musk, Teslas CEO and co-founder, who shared images of it on Twitter over the weekend. Tesla has already taken in roughly half a billion dollars in Model 3 deposits, at $1,000 apiece, and its proposed ramp-up schedule would have it rivaling well-established U.S. market peers like BMW and Mercedes by years end. The only thing standing between Tesla and being the worlds first mass-market electric carmaker is proving it can build, deliver, and service enormous numbers of these vehicleswithout sacrificing quality.One down, millions more to go. The production acceleration will be slow at first. Tesla plans to hand over the keys to 30 cars at a launch celebration on July 28. It then envisions building 100 carsless than three a dayfor the month of August, according to a series of Twitter posts by Musk last week. September will bring another 1,500 cars, and the ramp will build to a rate of 20,000 cars a month by December, Musk said. Its an aggressive schedule that will more than double Teslas total production rate in six months, and then quintuple it by the end of next year.If Tesla achieves all of Musks targets, it will build more battery-powered cars next year than all of the worlds automakers combined in 2016. U.S. sales under Musks 2018 targets would significantly outpace the BMW 3 Series and the Mercedes C-Class, the best-selling small luxury cars in the country.Tesla, by tradition, delivers the first new car off the line to the first customer to pay full price once the car officially goes on sale. Musks collection includes the first Tesla Roadster and the first Model Xbut not the first Model S. That trophy belongs to Tesla board of directors member Steve Jurvetson, who told the Chicago Tribune in 2010 that he scored the first of Teslas flagship sedans by writing out a check just before a board meeting and tossing it across the table. The right to the first Model 3 was won by board member Ira Ehrenpreis, who then gifted it to Musk for his 46th birthday, on June 28.Heres what we know about what might be coming next:The rollout begins. Key handoffs will begin in California and move east, focusing first on employees of Palo Alto, California-based Tesla and Musks SpaceX rocket company, based in Hawthorne, California, then on other U.S. reservation holders who stood in line before the cars unveiling some 15 months ago. People who place new orders today wont receive their cars until the middle of next year, according to Teslas website.The carmaker will be taking things slowly at first, as it looks to avoid the disastrous rollout of the Model X, which was marred by mis-aligned body panels, software glitches, problems with the falcon wing doors and spaceship-like seats, and a fleet-wide recall tied to a seatbelt issue. (These faults have largely been addressed, and the Model X is now the fourth best-selling luxury SUV in the U.S.) Theres tremendous demand for the Model 3 among Teslas 30,000 employeesmost of whom are unable to afford the pricier Model S and Model X. Musk is putting that interest to use, releasing the first several thousand Model 3s to employee reservation holders. Any problems identified during the early rollout can be quickly addressed at the factory.Features are being stripped down. Over the past few months, Musk has consistently tried to downplay expectations for new features. The car that rolled off the production line on Friday shouldnt stray far from the original prototype unveiled in March 2016. There will only be one displaythe cars 15-inch touchscreenwith no additional gauges or heads-up-display projected at the windshield. Additionally, the dual-motor all-wheel drive and high performance versions of the Model 3 will be delayed for six to nine months to keep initial production as simple as possible. New Aero wheels are coming. Tesla was granted a patent on June 6 for this new aerodynamic wheel face, one of two designs that the company has deployed on the test cars seen driving around the country in recent months. (The other design is shown in the production car above).Tesla briefly offered Aero wheels for the Model S in 2013, but they were considered unattractive by many consumers and were quickly pulled from the market. At the time, Tesla said they could boost the car's range by 3 to 4 percent.  How far is Tesla going with Autopilot for the launch? Last October, Musk set some wild timelines for full self-driving capabilities in the Tesla fleet. The company upgraded the hardware suite of its full line-up of cars to eight surround cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors, a forward radar, and a massively powerful new computer. He said it was all the hardware that will be needed for driverless transport. By the end of 2017, Musk said, he hoped to demonstrate a cross-country trip without any driver interaction.So far, Tesla hasnt backed off those predictions. For the past nine months, its been charging customers an extra $3,000 for an option called Full Self-Driving Capability. However, the software still hasnt been released to make any new features available, and to date, the pricey option adds no additional functionality. Musk has dropped a number of hints that those features will start rolling out around the launch of the Model 3. In January, I asked him at what point Full Self-Driving Capability will depart from the Enhanced Autopilot features. His response, via a post on Twitter: 3 months maybe, 6 months definitely. Six months would coincide with the July launch. Tesla has yet to release a detailed list of the Model 3s specs, features, and pricing, more of which will be revealed at the cars launch party on July 28. Heres what has been disclosed so far: The era of the Model 3 has begun. Now its time for Tesla to really get to work.  "
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-pharmaceuticals-lupin-idUSKBN19U011,LUPIN SETS OFF DOWN INDIAN PHARMA'S LONG ROAD TO REDEMPTION,"GOA, India (Reuters) - In 28 years in India's pharmaceuticals sector, Rajiv Desai has never been busier.  Most of the last six months on his desk calendar is marked green, indicating visits to the 12 plants of Lupin, India's No. 2 drugmaker, where Desai is a senior quality control executive. Only one day is red - a day off. That's what is needed these days to satisfy the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that standards are being met. ""In this sector, you're only as good as your last inspection,"" Desai said in his office in suburban Mumbai.      Often dubbed ""the pharmacy of the world"", India is home to the most FDA-approved plants outside of the United States and supplies about 40 percent of the $70 billion worth of generic drugs sold in the country. But sanctions and bans have badly damaged India's reputation and slowed growth in the $16 billion sector. Drug exports fell in the fiscal year ending in March 2017. More than 40 plants have been banned by the FDA for issues ranging from data fraud to hygiene since India's then-largest drugmaker Ranbaxy was pulled up for serious violations in 2008.  Drug companies have spent millions of dollars on training, new equipment and foreign consultants. Yet the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance of the top 20 firms says its members still need at least five more years to get manufacturing standards and data reliability up to scratch. The case of Lupin, whose shares are down about 27 percent since 2015 compared to a 13 percent drop in the Nifty pharma index, shows why. The FDA is in the next few months expected to clear Lupin's Goa plant, which supplies around a third of its U.S. sales, of problems found in 2015, Desai said.  However, the agency also published a new notice just last week citing issues with data storage at its plant in Pithampur, central India. If companies want to continue to sell into the world's biggest health care market, they must keep constant vigilance. Many in the industry expect to see consolidation among manufacturers after a wave of mergers among U.S. drug distributors and increasing price pressures. ""A lot of companies will struggle to meet the requirements that are the need of the day, and I would expect to see additional consolidation on the supply side,"" Lupins Chief Executive Vinita Gupta told analysts last month. Asked about Lupin's case, the FDA said in a statement it did not ""comment on compliance matters"", but said generally: ""Indias regulatory infrastructure must keep pace to ensure that relevant quality and safety standards are met.""  India has its own standards body, the Central Drug Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), which maintains that its quality controls are stringent enough to ensure drugs are safe. ""India's standards are different,"" CDSCO head G.N. Singh said in an interview in his New Delhi office. ""Indian companies are compliant with our manufacturing standards. We cannot regulate them according to the U.S. standards."" The FDA has taken matters into its own hands and gradually expanded in India to more than a dozen full-time staff. Inspections are frequent and increasingly unannounced. If the agency finds problems, it issues a Form 483  a notice outlining the violations - which if not resolved can lead to a ""warning letter"" and in worst case, a ban. Violations range from hygiene, such as rat traps and dirty laboratories, to inadequate controls on systems that store data, leaving it open to tampering. None of the violations the FDA has cited in India have explicitly said the drugs are unsafe, and when companies are banned by the FDA they can sell into other markets, including in the developing world, until the bans are lifted. There are also no studies showing that the drugs have harmed anyone in the world. But by definition, the notices are issued when the FDA finds conditions that might harm public health.      Industry watchers say Lupin, which specializes in oral contraceptives and drugs for diabetes and hypertension, is doing better than most. So far none of its infractions have extended to a ban.  On a recent visit by Reuters to its Goa plant, blue-uniformed employees could be seen working on giant machines, then making notes in hardbound registers. These are being phased out as Lupin transitions to more secure e-files. Employees are often videotaped to ensure they follow standard operating procedure. Manufacturers have cut back to focus on quality over quantity: five years ago, Lupin was making one billion pills a month at one of its Goa plants. Now it makes just 450 million. Both the company and employees needed to be willing to acknowledge errors, Desai said. The first impulse in the past was often ""don't tell anyone"", he said. ""We're humans after all, not robots. We make mistakes,""  said Amol Kolatkar, a production head at the Goa site.     As recently as three years ago, training was a ""formality"", Desai said. Now, when an error is traced to an employee, the entire team undergoes fresh training.  ""I have worked at a pharma company before, but this is the first time I went through such a training,"" said another Lupin quality control officer, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. ""They told us a lot about the Lupin culture and quality, and also stressed on good manufacturing practices."" The quality control role is key.  ""They (Lupin) have had a practice where companys quality heads report directly to Nilesh Gupta (the managing director),"" said Amey Chalke, an analyst at HDFC Securities. ""Some other companies have also started doing that now.""      The companies also have to be willing to spend big. Lachman, PwC and Boston Consulting conduct mock audits at the Goa plant every three to six months, at a cost of up to $400 an hour. ""These days the FDA is giving us 483 on small, small things,"" a third quality control officer said. ""So we are always auditing.""

It happened Sunday around 7 p.m. on East 14th Street.



The family chose not to be identified because the man responsible has not been caught. The 14-year old said he initially approached her in an SUV.



Ã¢ÂÂHe asked if he gave me money, if I would go with him to Braum's,Ã¢ÂÂ the girl said.



She said she told him no and kept walking. That is when he got out of his car.



Ã¢ÂÂHe grabbed me by the arm and I started screaming, then he covered my mouth and tried to pull me between the cars,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂI kept screaming and I tried to get him off of me the whole time and then later on I bit him to get away from him.Ã¢ÂÂ



She ran for her life to a familiar face at a nearby apartment complex.



Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt understand anyone who wants to hit a boy girl or any child period,Ã¢ÂÂ the girlÃ¢ÂÂs mother said. Ã¢ÂÂHe needs to go to jail.Ã¢ÂÂ



It is a hard dose of reality for the family now. The mother said she has talked to her daughter about what could have happened had she not gotten away.



Ã¢ÂÂWe donÃ¢ÂÂt know if he was part of a ring,Ã¢ÂÂ the mother said. Ã¢ÂÂThey have those sex trafficking rings. What they do is they drug these young girls and they take them and they sell them into slavery. You would never ever see us again. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs scary.Ã¢ÂÂ

The family did file a report with Tulsa police. If you have any information on the incident, call police.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-rights-liu-idUSKBN19U06H,FOREIGN DOCTORS SAY SICK CHINESE DISSIDENT LIU CAN BE TAKEN OVERSEAS,"SHENYANG, China (Reuters) - Ailing Chinese Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo can be moved abroad safely for treatment and he wants to go to either Germany or the United States, but it needs to happen soon, two foreign doctors who visited him said on Sunday. Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for ""inciting subversion of state power"" after he helped write a petition known as ""Charter 08"" calling for sweeping political reforms. He was recently moved from jail to a hospital in the city of Shenyang to be treated for late-stage liver cancer. On Saturday, two doctors from the United States and Germany visited him to assess his condition and consult on his treatment, after being invited by the hospital. ""Liu Xiaobo and his family have requested that the remainder of his care be provided in Germany or the United States,"" Joseph M. Herman of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and Markus Buechler of the University of Heidelberg said in a joint statement.   ""While a degree of risk always exists in the movement of any patient, both physicians believe Mr Liu can be safely transported with appropriate medical evacuation care and support. However, the medical evacuation would have to take place as quickly as possible."" The doctors acknowledged the quality of care he has received and said they agreed with the diagnosis of primary liver cancer.""The physicians have recommended Mr Liu receive palliative supportive care. Additional options may exist, including interventional procedures and radiotherapy,"" they said. The University of Heidelberg and MD Anderson have both agreed to accept Liu for treatment and both are prepared to offer him the best care possible, they said. China's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Liu would be allowed to leave. The hospital said on Saturday moving him would not be safe. A woman who answered the phone at the hospital on Sunday said she did not know about Liu's case. There are police cars parked outside all entrances to the hospital, which is located in the middle of downtown Shenyang.  A man, not in uniform, on Sunday blocked a Reuters reporter from entering the building where friends say Liu is being treated, saying access was only for patients or upon invitation. Calls have grown from rights groups and Western governments for China to allow Liu to travel with his wife, Liu Xia, to be treated overseas. Hu Jia, another well known dissident, welcomed the doctors' statement as very positive, saying it essentially refuted suggestions Liu was too sick to be moved and it paved the way for him to be treated abroad.  ""Firstly, this gives foreign diplomats Liu Xiaobo's authorization. Secondly, it gives them the professional assessment that Liu Xiaobo can travel,"" he said. Ye Du, an activist and friend of Liu and Liu Xia, said the statement proved that information released by the hospital was inaccurate and politically motivated.  ""I call on the governments of Germany, the United States, France and the United Kingdom as well as rights groups to pressure (China) together,"" he said.  It is not clear if the foreign doctors are still in Shenyang. A source with knowledge of the consultation and friend of the family told Reuters late on Saturday that Liu had told the foreign doctors he hoped to go abroad for treatment, but the government had been very clear they would not allow this. In a brief statement earlier on Sunday, the hospital said Liu was finding it difficult to eat and he was being given nutritional support and pain medication.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-crimea-power-commissio-idUSKBN19T0VA,EXCLUSIVE: FIRM PART-OWNED BY SIEMENS HIRED TO HELP INSTALL TURBINES IN CRIMEA - SOURCES,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - A firm part-owned by Germany's Siemens has been hired to help install electricity turbines in Crimea, a region subject to European Union sanctions barring EU firms from supplying it with energy technology, three sources close to the project told Reuters. Reuters exclusively reported earlier this week, citing sources with knowledge of the delivery, that Russia had delivered Siemens-made turbines to Crimea for use in two power plants under construction there. Siemens has denied it supplied any turbines to Crimea. In a statement issued on Friday, it said that if one of its customers had, in violation of the sales contract, re-routed any turbines to Crimea, the company ""will not provide any deliveries or services for installation, commissioning support, or warranty."" However, the three sources said that one of the firms involved in the installation and commissioning of the turbines in Crimea is Russian-registered ZAO Interautomatika. Siemens has a 45.7 percent stake in the firm, according to public records. According to its website, the systems that Interautomatika offers to clients ""are based on the use of technology that is produced by Siemens, or under license from Siemens.""  On Siemens' Russian language website, Interautomatika is described as a ""Solution Partner"" to the German firm. Asked about the involvement of Interautomatika in the Crimea power plants project, a Siemens spokesman said in a statement provided to Reuters: ""Siemens stands by its earlier position that no gas-turbine warranty, installation and commissioning support services will be provided."" ""We are investigating the involvement of Interautomatika in the commissioning of gas turbines and any other services and if proven true, we will take all necessary and available steps to terminate any activities as soon as possible."" Technopromexport, the Russian state-owned firm which is building the two power plants, declined to answer questions about the issue. Interautomatika did not immediately respond to Reuters questions. Reuters has not been able to determine if Siemens knew of or approved of the delivery of the turbines, or the role of Interautomatika in the power plant projects. The turbines, and the role of Interautomatika, expose the Germany company to potential accusations of insufficient safeguards to ensure its equipment does not end up on territory most countries view as illegally annexed, some legal experts say. In its statement on Friday, Siemens said it had no credible evidence about actual deliveries of its turbines to Crimea but had set up a task force to clarify the facts. It said it had taken all possible legal measures and would take operational steps to prevent the equipment from being used unlawfully. The Kremlin wants to get the two Crimean power plants up and running to fulfill a promise, made by President Vladimir Putin, to ensure a stable power supply for the region's residents after it was annexed by Moscow from Ukraine in 2014. The Siemens-made turbines are a vital component because they are the only ones that fit into the foundations already laid for the power plants, and Russian firms are not able to manufacture comparable equipment on their own. Technopromexport, the main contractor on the project, said on Thursday that it bought the turbines on the secondary market. It did not disclose the seller or the manufacturer of the turbines. It said they had been modernized by specialized Russian factories and engineering companies which it did not name. Delivering the turbines to the site of the power stations is only the start of a complex process to get them running. They are highly sophisticated pieces of equipment packed with electronics and running off specialist software. They therefore require specialist engineers to install and commission them.  One of the three sources, who all spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said a contract had been signed under which Interautomatika, together with other Russian firms, would provide commissioning services for the turbines in Crimea.  The source did not say when the contract with Interautomatika was signed, or who awarded the contract.  Reuters was not able to find documents on the award of such a contract.  EU sanctions bar European individuals and companies from providing energy technology to Crimea or from taking any actions designed to circumvent those rules due to the bloc's view that the peninsula was illegally stolen from Ukraine.  Legal experts say there are no court precedents to say whether Siemens could be held responsible if a third party supplied the technology to Crimea.  The European Commission did not respond to a request for comment on the delivery of the turbines. An EU source with knowledge of the issue said the EU has little ability to ensure compliance, leaving much of that to national governments. When asked about the delivery of the turbines on Wednesday, a spokesman for German's Ministry for Economic Affairs said he had no immediate comment. The other Interautomatika shareholders apart from Siemens are Technopromexport, with 17 percent, and VTI, a Russian power sector research institute, with 37 percent, according to the company's website.

His adventures would cast a spell over the world, enchanting children in scores of languages and selling millions of copies.

In an interview with CNN, Rowling revealed that she has written yet another fairy tale -- but this one may never be published.

Rowling, who famously wrote her first novel longhand in Edinburgh cafÃÂ©s, says that she scrawled the secret manuscript across her 50th birthday party dress. In a disclosure that will shock many die-hard Harry Potter fans, the ""book"" now hangs in her closet.

Rowling dropped the bombshell at the end of an interview about her children's charity Lumos, in which she discussed her worst fears and why she is determined to put an end to orphanages.

CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: I read that you were considering writing a political book for children, young people?

J.K. ROWLING: Oh, that was a fairy tale ...

But I -- I will tell you this. On my 50th -- the theme of my 50th birthday, which I held at Halloween, even though that's not really my birthday, was come as your own private nightmare. And I went as a lost manuscript. And I wrote over a dress most of that book. So that book, I don't know whether it will ever be published, but it's actually hanging in a wardrobe currently.

AMANPOUR: How would you decide that this [starting her children's charity Lumos] was your mission?

ROWLING: What drew me in was one child. It was a news report about one child in a newspaper.

I was pregnant and therefore perhaps particularly vulnerable and emotional to anything to do with small children. And I'm flicking through the Sunday paper and I saw what -- still I see it in my memory. It was a very disturbing image of a very small boy screaming through chicken wire.

And I went to turn the page. I'm not proud of it, but I did go to turn the page. And then I -- I stopped and I thought, if the story is as bad as the picture looks, then you have to do something about it.

So I turned back and I read the story. And the story was about an institution in the Czech Republic where this boy, among many other children with special needs, was being kept, I would say, at least 20 hours out of 24 in a cage-bed, which is exactly as it sounds. It's a cot for a baby covered in -- covered in mesh, covered in wire. And that was his existence. And from that, that's how it all began. I was just appalled and horrified.

Rowling on her worst fear

JUST WATCHED J.K. Rowling's worst fear? Small spaces Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH J.K. Rowling's worst fear? Small spaces 01:49

ROWLING: I think my worst fear, my personal worst fear, is powerlessness and small spaces. So when you think about that little boy trapped in the cage-bed, he is totally voiceless. And nobody was speaking for him.

And I think that -- we all have something that touches us on a very visceral level. I mean -- and I think that's mine. That's my thing.

AMANPOUR: And small spaces, why?

ROWLING: I don't know. I've always had that. And I think that just the idea that these children were being kept penned like this was horrific to me. But then so although I didn't think that's like Harry in his cupboard, I suppose why did I put Harry in the cupboard? Because this is my fear, being trapped and being powerless, just powerless to get out of that space. So yeah, on a very crude level, I think that news story tapped into something that I found personally horrifying.

ROWLING: Oh, because my publisher, who published Harry Potter, they said to me, we think this is a book that will appeal to boys and girls. And I said, oh, great. And they said, so could we use your initials?

Because, basically they were trying to disguise my gender. And obviously, that lasted about three seconds, because -- which is wonderful. I'm certainly not complaining, but the book won an award and I got a big advance from America and I got a lot of publicity. So I was outed as a woman.

AMANPOUR: And you're a strong woman role model.

ROWLING: Well, that's right. I quite like J.K. ... I think I -- I wouldn't have chosen it. It's -- and I wouldn't have chosen it for that reason, either.

But I was so grateful to be published, if they told me to call myself Rupert, I probably would have done to be honest with you. But now, I actually quite like having a pen name, because I feel that's -- to an extent, that feels like an identity and then I'm -- in private life, I'm Jo Murray.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-israel-ukraine-idUSKBN19H0FY,"SHORT OF IT WORKERS AT HOME, ISRAELI STARTUPS RECRUIT ELSEWHERE","TEL AVIV (Reuters) - When Alexey Chalimov founded software design firm Eastern Peak in Israel four years ago he knew he would not find the developers he needed at home. He went to Ukraine and hired 120 people to develop mobile apps and web platforms for international clients and smaller Israeli startups. ""I worked for years in the Israeli market and I knew what the costs were in Israel and I knew there was a shortage of workers,"" he told Reuters. Driven by startups, Israel's technology industry is the fastest growing part of the economy. It accounts for 14 percent of economic output and 50 percent of exports.  But a shortage of workers means its position at the cutting edge of global technology is at risk, with consequences for the economy and employment. The government's Innovation Authority forecasts a shortage of 10,000 engineers and programmers over the next decade in a market that employs 140,000. Israel has dropped six spots in three years to 17th in the World Economic Forum's ranking of the ease of finding skilled technology employees. The shortage is particularly painful for Israel's 5,000 startups which compete for talent with development centers of technology giants such as Google, Intel, Microsoft and Apple. They offer big incentives that a startup cannot afford. Israel will lose its edge if the shortage isn't tackled, said Noa Acker, head of policy at the societal challenges division at the Innovation Authority. ""Salaries will be very high and the industry will shrink to only very high level R&D while much of the work will be exported,"" she said.  The main reason for the shortfall is a sharp drop in the number of computer science, maths and statistics graduates, down from a peak of 3,000 in 2005 to a low of 1,600 in 2008. This is partly due to problems in secondary and primary schools where lack of funding means some classrooms do not have computers and advanced maths teachers are in short supply. ""Why do we still have classes where there are no computers?"" said Yifat Turbiner, a researcher in entrepreneurship and innovation at Ben-Gurion University. ""If more budgets aren't allocated to generate a technological state of mind ... from elementary school, I believe all industries will suffer, not just high-tech."" Another reason for the shortage of computer science graduates is that after the dotcom bubble burst in 2000 many Israeli high tech workers lost their jobs, Acker said. This meant that students lost interest in tech careers and university applications declined. The Education Ministry has announced plans to boost studies of maths and science, especially in high-schools outside the cities where advanced classes are not always available. But Turbiner said initiatives are also needed for a higher standard of maths at a younger age including training more teachers. The government also has long-term initiatives to integrate ultra-Orthodox Jews and Arabs -- two fast-growing segments of the population with low labor participation -- into the industry.  Ultra-Orthodox Jews make up about 11 percent of the population and many prioritize religious studies over science and maths.  Military technology expertise gained by soldiers during their service has been behind several successful Israeli firms including the countrys biggest tech company, Check Point Software Technologies. The government is also running ""boot camps"" of up to 18 months to train tech workers without technology degrees. While the government takes steps to stimulate organic growth of workers at home, it is also making changes to visas for a quick fix of importing foreign workers.  The government is preparing 500 visas for students from abroad who studied science and engineering at Israeli universities so they can stay to work at tech firms for a year. It is also working on easing bureaucratic hurdles to unlimited expert visas.  In the meantime, many Israeli startups are looking abroad. Ukraine is the top destination with about 100 Israeli development centers. A strong tradition of maths and computer science teaching that is present in many countries in former Soviet Union countries means Ukraine has more than 20,000 IT graduates each year. The 1990s arrival of a million immigrants from former Soviet countries, many of them scientists who went to work for technology companies, has also created strong ties. Israeli companies have also recruited workers in other eastern European countries such as Poland and Bulgaria.  Wix.com, which helps small businesses build websites and is one of Israel's hottest tech companies, employs 120 workers in two development centers in Ukraine and another 80 at a site in Lithuania. ""They are in the same time zone, they have a good level of English and all are Russian speakers. Some of our people here are former Russians,"" said Boaz Inbal, general manager of Wix's development centers. ""We have direct flights to both countries. It's easy for us to collaborate and communicate."" Salaries for software developers in Ukraine are about 40 percent lower than in Israel, said Andrey Link, an executive vice president at Ukrainian software engineering firm Infopulse.  But he said: ""The key argument in our favor is not the cost but availability. To find 2-3 people (in Israel) is not a problem, but if they need...an R&D center for 100 people, it is very difficult in Israel.""

http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/06/health/opioid-prescriptions-cdc/index.html,"OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS DROPPED BUT REMAIN HIGH, CDC SAYS","(CNN) Opioids continue to be prescribed at high rates, a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds, even as drug overdoses remain the leading cause of accidental death in the country, killing more people than guns or car accidents.

""The bottom line is, we still have too many people getting too many opioid prescriptions for too many days at too high a dosage,"" said acting CDC Director Dr. Anne Schuchat.

Prescriptions are measured by morphine milligram equivalents, which uses morphine as a baseline to measure the equivalent prescribed opioid, which may be more powerful.

Opioids -- both legal, such as prescription oxycodone and hydrocodone, and illicit drugs, such as street fentanyl and heroin -- killed more than 33,000 Americans in 2015. Half of those deaths involved prescription narcotics.

""Reducing prescriptions is just one part of a bigger charge to address the overall problem. It's a very important piece of the puzzle,"" Schuchat said.

Prescription opioid-related overdose deaths and treatment of opioid use disorder have trended similarly to the increase in opioid prescriptions, which quadrupled from 1999 to 2010. Much of this increase has been attributed to the increase in opioids being used to treat chronic pain.

""Try to prevent people initiating opioids unless necessary,"" said Caleb Banta-Green, an associate professor of health services at the University of Washington who was not involved with the new CDC report. ""Physical and emotional stress and discomfort are common. We all experience them. Rarely are opioids the best treatment for short-term health conditions.""

If the pain is going to last only a week or two, he said, try over-the-counter pain relievers.

Every community is affected

The report, which is the first to offer a county-by-county breakdown of prescribing across the nation, found varied prescribing practices.

The report analyzed retail prescription data at the county level from 2006 to 2015. It found that the top prescribing counties had nearly six times the number of prescriptions as those with the lowest rates of prescriptions.

""Opioid prescribing varies as much from place to place as the weather, and even neighboring counties have major differences in prescribing levels,"" Schuchat said.

Residents of those counties with the highest prescription rates have a greater risk of opioid addiction, overdose and death as a result of the higher prescribing practices.

The counties with the highest levels of prescriptions tended to have larger white populations, higher rates of unemployment and greater numbers enrolled in Medicaid.

Previous reports have shown that rural areas have been particularly hard-hit, but that is not captured in this report. Schuchat explained that it's because the data are based on where the prescriptions were picked up, not where people with the prescriptions live. Rural areas don't have as many pharmacies, so many residents must travel to have their prescriptions filled.

But there are some places that seem to be succeeding. In Florida, where there have been major efforts to crack down on excessive opioid prescribing between 2010 and 2012, 80% of counties reported a decrease in prescriptions. Likewise, in Ohio and Kentucky, where providers are required to review a database of prescription information by way of monitoring, 85% and 62% of counties reported decreases in prescription practices.

The authors of the study also found that the average dose of prescriptions and the overall rate of prescriptions -- from 81.2 to 70.6 prescriptions for every 100 persons from 2010 to 2015 -- were trending downward.

However, the average length of days for prescriptions increased. The average days' supply prescribed increased 33%, from 13.3 days in 2006 to 17.7 in 2015. A previous study from the CDC found that prescriptions for eight or more days increased the likelihood of using a drug a year later to 13.5%. And although just less than 7% of all prescriptions exceed a month's dosage, using for 31 days or more increased the chances of long-term opioid use to 29.9%.

In an attempt to rein in the over-prescribing of these medications, the CDC established new guidelines for prescribing practices in 2016 emphasizing that non-opioid treatments should be considered first-line therapies for dealing with chronic pain in adults and should be used for chronic pain only when the benefits outweigh the risks. Because the new study looked at prescription data between 2006 and 2015, the study didn't account for the impact of these new recommendations.

However, in 2009, the American Pain Society and the American Academy of Pain Medicine released guidelines aimed at reducing prescribing habits by care providers. The US Department of Veterans Affairs and the US Department of Defense issued a similar set of guidelines in 2010 that focused on reducing prescribed dosages. Schuchat believes these sets of guidelines triggered some improvement, which is reflected in the new report.

Separately, some states -- Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York and Maine -- have adopted legislation that limits opioid prescriptions to seven days. This year, New Jersey became the strictest, limiting painkiller prescriptions to just five days.

The study also did not identify whether reducing the number of prescriptions translates directly to an overall reduction in the number of people abusing opioid drugs. The latest numbers from the CDC find that the number of overdoses due to heroin and illicit synthetics are on the rise. In fact, between 2014 and 2015, the percent of overdoses attributed to synthetic opioids, much of it attributed to illicit fentanyl, rose by 72% in one year.

""We know the country is experiencing the highest overdose rates ever recorded, and it's driven by prescription and illicit opioid use,"" Schuchat said. ""Improvements in prescribing (habits) are just the beginning, but we have so much work to do."""

Thousands of individuals and several businesses have taken major hits since Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic ties and shut off all transport links with Qatar. The four countries accuse Qatar of destabilizing the Middle East by funding terrorism in the region, a claim the Qatari government has denied.

The countries have sought to extract concessions from Qatar in return for restoration of diplomatic and economic ties. The demands include closing the state-funded Al Jazeera media network, reducing diplomatic ties with Iran, and halting the construction of a Turkish military base in Qatar.

Last week, the four nations said they would continue the boycott after a deadline for Qatar to comply with their demands came and went without a resolution being agreed. Qatar's foreign minister said his nation wouldn't comply with any demands that it considers a violation of international law.

Diplomatic efforts are underway to resolve the crisis.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrives in Kuwait, which is helping mediate the dispute, on Monday. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson also traveled to the region last week and met senior officials from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar.

http://cnn.com/2017/07/08/us/man-proposes-while-arrested-trnd/index.html,MAN PROPOSES TO GIRLFRIEND WHILE ARRESTED,"(CNN) An Oklahoma couple is showing the world that ""through thick and thin"" starts before marriage.

Police officers were arresting Brandon Thompson, 35, at his Muskogee home on July 4 when he made an odd request. He wanted to propose to his girlfriend, Leandria Keith. A police body camera caught the moment Thompson got down on one knee.

""I didn't want to part ways with her not showing exactly how I feel for her,"" Thompson told CNN by phone. ""I want her to be my wife for the rest of my life.""

'You want to do what?'

The family was celebrating Thompson's birthday and Independence Day -- which fall on the same day -- in their front yard when police officers showed up. Officer Bob Lynch had seen Thompson earlier in the day and recognized him from the several felony warrants out for his arrest, so he followed him to the home.

The officers were in the process of detaining Thompson in the front yard when the suspect made his request.

""I asked the officer if I could propose,"" said Thompson. ""The officer said, 'You want to do what?' and I said, 'I want to propose to her.'""

Lynch and his partner, Officer Lincoln Anderson, agreed to let him do it.

""It took us by surprise that he asked if he could do it,"" Anderson, who is also the Muskogee police spokesman, told CNN via Facebook.

The bodycam video shows Thompson asking his mother if he should ""do it now"" and told her to get the ring. That is when he got down on one knee.

""I love you,"" Thompson is heard saying. ""Will you be my wife, please?""

Keith said yes. The officer wearing the bodycam is then seen switching Thompson's handcuffed hands from his back to his front so he could place the engagement ring on Keith's finger.

""I was shocked,"" Keith told CNN.

The couple has been together since May 2016. They told CNN they will set a date for their wedding once Thompson's legal troubles are resolved.

""When you're in love with somebody and you know that you want to spend the rest of your life with them, you just want them to know how you feel,"" said Thompson. ""I wanted a new start for me and with the police taking me to jail I didn't have to worry about my warrants anymore.""

'I'm tired of running'

Brandon Edward Thompson, 35, proposed to his girlfriend while being arrested.

Thompson said he has been ""doing a lot to turn his life around."" He has been coaching a peewee football team, which gives him an opportunity to give back to the community, he said.

""So many young kids grow up without fathers and don't have the correct type of guidance,"" said Thompson. ""I've been down that road before. I don't want them to make the same mistakes I've made.""

Muskogee County District Court documents show Thompson had six felony warrants out for his arrest. Anderson told CNN that the bench warrants were for failure to appear in court or failure to pay.

""He told me two weeks before, 'Mama, can I come home because I'm tired of running,'"" Thompson's mother, Judy Peal, told CNN. ""When the police arrived I told him, 'Place your hand in your mother's hand and we'll walk out.'""

The bodycam video shows Thompson promising his mother and new fiancÃÂ©e that he will turn his life around and ""get a job.""

Keith pulled the couple's savings together to bail Thompson out of jail. He was released the day after his arrest.

Thompson's next court appearance will be July 17.

'Police officers are human'

Anderson says he hopes that allowing Thompson to propose will show people the human side of policing.

""We all want to see someone get their life on track,"" said Anderson. ""Hopefully it will help him make the choices it will take to support his future wife and his kids. And if by letting him take a moment before going to jail to do what he did, then we did our jobs.""

Peal told CNN the police officers were ""wonderful"" for letting her son propose to Keith while under arrest.

""Police officers are human. We care about the city we serve and the people in it,"" said Anderson. ""Sometimes the smallest gesture of kindness is the biggest influence in someone's life."""

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-westar-energy-m-a-gt-plains-energy-idUSKBN19V141,"GREAT PLAINS, WESTAR REVISE $14 BILLION MERGER TO EASE REGULATOR CONCERNS","(Reuters) - Utilities Great Plains Energy Inc (GXP.N) and Westar Energy Inc (WR.N) announced Monday new terms for their proposed $14 billion merger, hoping the revised structure would satisfy regulatory concerns which nixed the previous tie-up plan. The duo spent nearly a year in consolidation talks only for the Kansas Corporation Commission in April to rule against the transaction, insisting the deal as it stood was not in the best interests of the companies' 1.6 million customers in Kansas and Missouri. State regulators have become more proactive in recent months toward utility mergers and acquisitions, intervening in deals as they seek to protect local markets amid tough operating conditions for the power industry. Regulatory considerations are also a big part of the $18 billion-plus battle for Texas' Oncor Electric Delivery Co, which is subject to competing interest from Berkshire Hathaway and Elliott Management. ""I'm okay admitting that we were disappointed with the order in April, but the order was specific in what [the regulator] wanted changed and that they were open to us working together to reach a solution,"" Mark Ruelle, chief executive officer of Westar Energy, told Reuters in a phone interview. The companies are working with all stakeholders including regulators to gain necessary approvals, with the aim of closing the merger in the first half of 2018, according to a joint statement. Under the revised terms, the two firms will approach the tie-up as a merger of equals, with a holding company created, in which Westar Energy shareholders will get one share for each of their current shares, and Great Plains stockholders getting 0.5981 shares for each they own. Previously, Great Plains had proposed buying Westar and making it a subsidiary, using around $8 billion of borrowing: a level of debt with which the Kansas regulator was unhappy. ""The ultimate structure of merger of equals was the only way to meet the interests of both (shareholders and consumers),"" Terry Bassham, chief executive officer of Great Plains, told Reuters. The duo have proposed a one-off pool worth upwards of $50 million, which would be distributed to consumers in 2018, while Westar shareholders should expect a 15 percent increase in dividend payouts to match the payout Great Plains stockholders currently receive. The combined company will also buy back around 30 million shares in both 2018 and 2019, Bassham added. Annual cost savings generated by the merger, rising to $140 million to $170 million in 2021, from $35 million to 45 million next year, would help finance these measures, while also allowing the company to achieve the profit level allowed by a regulated utility without increasing customer rates. U.S. power firms are battling the financial impact of greater consumer efficiency on demand, making mergers which help cut costs attractive. Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Lazard were financial advisers to Great Plains, with Guggenheim Securities advising Westar. Bracewell and Baker Botts were the respective legal advisers.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-consumers-idUSKBN19V1W9,"U.S HOUSEHOLDS SEE SPENDING UP, JOB PROSPECTS IMPROVING: NEW YORK FED SURVEY","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Consumers expect to boost spending in the months ahead and voiced confidence they are more likely to find a job and less likely to lose one in a strong labor market, the New York Federal Reserve reported Monday in its latest monthly survey of consumer expectations. Nearly 35 percent of the 1,300 heads of household included in the June poll said they were better off economically than a year go, a record in the four years the survey has been conducted. The results bolster the current Fed outlook of an economy that continues to generate jobs despite tepid overall growth and some concern about a recent dip in inflation, improving chances the central bank can follow through with plans for a further interest rate increase later this year. Though household expectations of inflation for the year ahead did dip slightly from the May survey, to 2.5 percent from 2.6 percent, respondents expect strong price increases of 2.8 percent over the coming three years. That's consistent with the Fed's current outlook that the recent weakness in inflation will prove temporary. The survey also bolstered the view of continued strong consumption growth. Half of those polled said they expected to spend at least 3.3 percent more in the coming year, compared to median expected spending growth of 2.6 percent in the May survey. One-year-ahead expected earnings growth increased to 2.5 percent in the June survey from 2.2 percent in May. Respondents also showed broad faith in the strength of the labor market, with a slight dip to 13.5 percent from 13.6 percent in the perceived probability of losing a job in the next year, and a jump to 59.2 percent from 56.7 percent in the probability of finding employment. More than a fifth of respondents said they might leave a job voluntarily in the next year, up from 19.4 percent in May. Voluntarily job exits are considered a sign of a strong labor market that offers employees choices. The online poll is designed to be a representative sample of the U.S. population.

http://cnn.com/2017/07/10/africa/somali-piracy-attack-spike/index.html,SOMALI PIRATE KINGS UNDER PROBE FOR HELPING ISIS,"(CNN) In the vital transport corridors of the troubled Gulf of Aden, an old but dangerous adversary has returned to the seas -- pirates.

But they may not be acting alone.

Four years since piracy attacks reached their peak, CNN sources have found threats on Somali waters are broader than ever.

Pirate kingpins

CNN has learned that the United Nations and the United States are investigating at least two pirate kingpins for providing material support to terror groups.

That material support includes helping factions of the two terror groups, al Qaeda linked al-Shabaab and Somalia's ISIS faction, who ironically despise each other, smuggle weapons and perhaps even people across the Gulf of Aden.

One of them is Mohamed Garfanje, the kingpin of the Hobyo-Haradhere Piracy Network, which thrived in the tiny fishing village of Haradhere -- often considered the birthplace of modern Somali piracy.

Garfanje is also one of the main suspects wanted for the kidnapping of American-German journalist Michael Scott Moore in 2012.

Mohamed Garfanje

Moore tells CNN he met Garfanje during the harrowing two years and a half he spent as an hostage.

According to three sources CNN has spoken to, Garfanje is believed to have helped al-Shabaab smuggle weapons and ammunition into Somalia.

He is also still carrying out pirate attacks, according to leading piracy watchdog organization, Oceans Beyond Piracy

""Garfanje should be in jail,"" Moore said. ""If it's true that he and Bakeyle (another pirate) are out catching ships again, then they should be rounded up by authorities and prosecuted.""

Another pirate kingpin, whom CNN is not naming, is believed to have been smuggling arms and people to ISIS' small but worrisome faction in Somalia, based in Qandala, in the semi-autonomous region of Puntland, according to UN and US sources.

UN sources say he has assisted ISIS with logistics and has a relationship with Abdulkadir Mumin, the leader of ISIS in Somalia.

Oceans Beyond Piracy researchers believe he is behind some of the recent piracy attacks in the Gulf of Aden.

Piracy spikes and US response

The Gulf of Aden off Somalia has been plagued by crimes at sea for years. It has been destabilized by a devastating, decades-long civil war on land.

After a four-year lull, more than 12 maritime piracy attacks have occurred off the coast of Somalia so far this year, according to this report by Oceans Beyond Piracy.

The recent pirate attacks have attracted comment from the US military. During US Secretary of Defense James Mattis' visit to the US base in Djibouti, he spoke on the rise in piracy in the region.

Mattis told reporters that the US military was monitoring the situation, but he added that he didn't see the US playing a ""big military role.""

This could change if those pirates are proven to be substantially aiding terrorists, says Joshua Meservey, a senior policy analyst for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank that has provided policy recommendations to President Donald Trump's administration.

Meservey told CNN that the US would have an incentive to disrupt the pirate networks if it ""gains conclusive evidence that pirates are actively helping al-Shabaab, such as by smuggling weapons to them.""

Jason Warner a professor at the US Military Academy, West Point, in the academy's Combating Terrorism Center, told CNN: ""At the very worst, there is active collusion; at the very least Shabaab gets a cut of the money from pirates emanating from Shabaab-held ground. There have also been instances of Shabaab taxing the pirates.""

""With the current trends indicating that piracy is once again picking up off the Horn of Africa, these relationships between pirates and Shabaab will likely re-emerge as an important flashpoint,"" Warner said.

""I think Trump does care about Somalia,"" said Meservey. ""He is clearly focused on terror threats, and al-Shabaab remains an effective, active terrorist organization.

""It also once attracted dozens of Americans to join it, and the fear is that it could do so again. I think the trend that began under Obama towards a more active military role in Somalia will continue with Trump,"" he added."
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-stada-arzneimitt-m-a-takeover-idUSKBN19V0LN,GERMANY'S STADA BACKS REVISED TAKEOVER BID FROM BAIN AND CINVEN,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Stada (STAGn.DE) backed a revised takeover bid on Monday from buyout groups Bain Capital and Cinven, which have secured backing from investors controlling around 20 percent of the German generic drugmaker's shares. Stada said the buyout firms had sweetened their takeover offer by 25 cents per share to 66.25 euros after their previous 5.3 billion-euro ($6 billion) bid fell through. The revised offer is approximately 16 million euros above the prior offer. The private equity groups will also lower their acceptance threshold to 63 percent, Stada said, after the last offer failed to win the backing of the 67.5 percent they had targeted. The new offer is the latest twist for the takeover of one of the last remaining independent generic drugmakers in Europe. Shares in Stada, which has seen management upheaval and previous failed offers, were up 1.2 percent at 65.27 euros by 1253 GMT, outperforming the German mid-cap index .MDAXI.   Stada's chief executive and its head of finance resigned last week after the failure of the earlier bid. Stada said Germany's Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) had approved the renewed offer, waiving Bain and Cinven from a one-year ban from resubmitting a revised offer. Carl Ferdinand Oetker, Chairman of Stada's Supervisory Board said it backed the new offer as ""a stable basis for developing Stada in the best interest of the company for the future"".    Some shareholders including U.S. hedge fund Elliott have bought stakes, speculating on securing a higher price for any remaining stock. The last takeover offer only won the backing of 65.52 percent of shareholders. Many buyout firms have been flush with cash after recent rounds of divestments and amid cheap borrowing costs. Sources have said that Bain and Cinven would look into buying more healthcare businesses to combine with Stada over the medium term, seeking cost cuts that would make the high investment in Stada worthwhile.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/07/health/alaska-worm-infection-walrus-meat-study/index.html,"USE CAUTION EATING WALRUS MEAT IN ALASKA, REPORT URGES","(CNN) Anyone looking to enjoy some walrus meat should be sure it's thoroughly cooked, officials say.

Alaska has had two outbreaks of trichellosis over the past year, which is a disease caused by ingesting animals that eat meat, namely walrus, according to a report published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The infection, also known as trichinosis, is caused by eating the raw or undercooked meat of animals that are infected with a worm called Trichinella, according to the CDC

The worm is typically found in pork as well as wild game such as bear and mountain lion. Trichinellosis cannot be spread through human contact.

Many residents of coastal communities in northern and western Alaska consume walrus and other marine mammals as part of subsistence hunting, or hunting for survival. This tradition is critical to their nutrition, food security and economic stability, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game

""People who are consuming walrus need to be aware that there is a possibility of being exposed to this parasite,"" said Yuri Springer, a co-author of the report and an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer for the Alaska Division of Public Health.

""They need to be aware of the types of symptoms they would be experiencing should they be infected, and they need to know that if they are infected, they can seek medical care to alleviate those symptoms,"" he said.

All 10 people affected in the Alaska outbreaks have recovered.

If a human or animal eats meat infected with Trichinella cysts, the CDC says, their stomach acid dissolves the hard covering of the cysts, releasing the worms, which then pass into the small intestine.

The worms mate and lay eggs that develop into immature worms, which travel through the arteries and into the muscles. There, they curl up and return to their original cyst formation, and the life cycle continues.

The first symptoms of trichinellosis can include abdominal issues such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and stomach pain. Further symptoms may include headaches, fevers, chills, cough, facial swelling, aching joints and muscle pain, caused by inflammation in the muscles from the worms burrowing through.

Tourists are not at risk of getting the infection from eating walrus, Springer said, because consumption takes place solely in coastal villages.

Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, only Alaska Natives are allowed to hunt and consume walrus, polar bears and several sea species, according to the report. It is not commercially available or served at restaurants.

""But we definitely have folks coming up from time to time to hunt bear. That's part of recreational hunting,"" Springer said. ""And I believe those persons may potentially be at risk if they consume meat from the harvested bear. So, yeah, those folks should definitely be aware of the risk of exposure.""

Anyone in the lower 48 who hunts and consumes wild game -- including bear, boar and mountain lion -- is susceptible, Springer said.

Trichinellosis and its impact

Trichinellosis used to be more common in the US, mostly caused by the ingestion of undercooked pork, according to the CDC.

The number of cases began to decline in the mid-20th century, after better sanitation management was implemented in the pork industry.

Infection has become increasingly rare, with an average of 15 cases per year reported in the US between 2008 and 2012, according to the CDC.

Globally, more than 65 000 cases and 42 deaths were reported across 41 countries between 1986 and 2009, one study reports. Pork was the major source of infection, but wild game was also frequently reported.

In 1975, there was an outbreak of trichinellosis in Alaska when 29 people ate walrus meat and most became ill, according to a study . Between that time and the latest illnesses, outbreaks occurred only in 1992 and 2002. Forty-four percent of these cases were connected to walrus consumption, and the rest were either related to bear or seal consumption, or had unidentified causes.

Springer said officials are not entirely sure what has caused the decline since 1975 or the rise of the new outbreaks, but there are a few possibilities. These include the timing and location of walrus hunting, changes in the parasitic burden in walrus populations, methods used to store and handle walrus meat, and reporting practices among ill persons.

The first recent outbreak occurred in 2016, when five coastal villagers who had consumed walrus meat that was raw or pan-fried to ""medium"" rare complained of symptoms, the report said.

Blood tests indicated that these cases had eosinophilia cells in their blood, a disease-fighting blood cell that is a common sign of parasitic infection. They were treated with anti-parasite medication and informed of the dangers of consuming undercooked or raw meat.

In 2017, five more villagers were diagnosed, and similar protocols were followed.

Dr. Daniel Eiras, assistant professor of infectious disease at NYU Langone Medical Center, who was not a part of the new CDC study, said he is skeptical of the use of an antibody blood test in diagnosing the disease.

""Antibody testing for trichinella, for many of these worm infections, is not great,"" Eiras said. ""There are a lot of false negatives, so you can't really rely on antibody testing.""

But the symptoms that were reported, as well as the cases' similarity to previous ones, are related to the infection, he said.

Spreading the word

A public service announcement has been distributed throughout the areas of Alaska impacted by the outbreak, as well as other coastal villages that could be affected in the future, Springer said.

Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.

The CDC report stresses the importance of being culturally sensitive when addressing the issue in areas where subsistence hunting is prevalent. This enables ""members of the target population to make informed decisions that integrate their traditional practices with their awareness and tolerance of risks,"" the report said.

Springer said he and his colleagues have let affected populations know about the ways in which they can reduce their risk of infection. They have informed them that the parasite can be killed only by thoroughly cooking the meat, not by freezing, drying or smoking it.

""Once we explained those things to the patients, as well as other members of the community, they were very understanding and receptive to the information,"" he said."

While he is just one of 25 Governing Council members who decide monetary policy for the currency bloc, concerns are rising among some of his colleagues that time is running out if they are to avoid undesirable market volatility.Villeroy de Galhaus choice of wording -- adapt the intensity -- which he said three times, adds to signs that the ECB intends to pare back stimulus in a way that doesnt tighten financial conditions. Officials are concerned that while growth is picking up, inflation and wages are not.President Mario Draghi signaled last month that he sees the expanding economy as allowing room for maneuver on stimulus while still maintaining the same level of monetary accommodation. Executive Board member Benoit Coeure said in remarks published on Friday that the ECBs action last December, when it announced a cut in monthly bond purchases to 60 billion euros from 80 billion euros starting in April this year, is a guide for how to make policy adjustments in future.Coeure also said its important for the central bank to be transparent in its communications, otherwise it risks more abrupt adjustment for the markets when the decisions are actually taken.The ECB next meets to set policy on July 20. It then has meetings on Sept. 7, Oct. 26 and Dec. 14, with the September and December decisions accompanied by fresh economic forecasts.Most economists expect QE to be tapered gradually to zero starting in 2018, but Villeroy de Galhau, speaking on the sidelines of the Rencontres Economiques conference in Aix-en-Provence, France, stressed that any change to quantitative easing shouldnt necessarily be seen that way. The 58-year-old also denied that the Governing Council is muddying the outlook by avoiding the topic.You spoke of winding down -- this is not a present debate, he said, adding that we have been extremely clear about the visibility, predictability of our monetary strategy.Other colleagues have advocated a faster roadmap for exiting stimulus, with Dutch Governor Klaas Knot warning on Friday that the central bank is very close to the point of keeping QE for too long, noting that the global financial crisis was partly caused by too much money being pumped into the system.Coeure, speaking again on Sunday at the same conference as Villeroy, urged that tools need to be developed on a regional level in order for the euro zone to withstand potential crises in the future.Today everything is fine, but what will happen when the euro zone receives its next shock? he said. Although it might be five years away, it will surely arrive.Chief Economist Peter Praet, who crafts the Executive Boards policy proposals and presents them at each Governing Council meeting, has consistently called for patience. Asked about the future of QE in an interview with Dutch newspaper De Standaard, published Saturday, he answered that I cant say anything about that yet, adding that officials cant be satisfied with the inflation outlook and we still need a long period of accommodative policy.Villeroy de Galhau said that what matters most is the real economy, and that the ECB should not let itself be distracted by political pressures or investor impatience.The most influential members of the Governing Council are pragmatists, he said. I clearly am a pragmatist."

The dollar rose after the Bank of Japan last week offered to buy an unlimited amount of bonds and following an unexpected drop in May in Japanese machinery orders that pressured the yen. Stocks on Wall Street edged higher as gains in technology outweighed losses in consumer staples and healthcare. Shares of Amazon.com (AMZN.O), lifted by the one-day sale event for subscribers to its Amazon Prime service, contributed the most points to the benchmark S&P 500. Amazon rose 1.8 percent to $996.47.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/10/politics/president-trump-defends-ivankas-seat-holding/index.html,TRUMP DEFENDS IVANKA'S SEAT-HOLDING AT G20,"(CNN) President Donald Trump took to Twitter Monday morning to defend his daughter Ivanka, who faced criticism this weekend as she briefly took his seat at the Group of 20 Summit.

""When I left Conference Room for short meetings with Japan and other countries, I asked Ivanka to hold seat. Very standard. Angela M agrees!"" he tweeted.

When I left Conference Room for short meetings with Japan and other countries, I asked Ivanka to hold seat. Very standard. Angela M agrees!

""If Chelsea Clinton were asked to hold the seat for her mother, as her mother gave our country away, the Fake News would say CHELSEA FOR PRES!"" he added

Clinton quickly responded on Twitter: ""Good morning Mr. President. It would never have occurred to my mother or my father to ask me. Were you giving our country away? Hoping not.""

Ivanka Trump has not yet commented about the incident.

When Ivanka Trump sat in on behalf of her father during a working session on Saturday morning in Hamburg, Germany, her presence caused a stir among Trump critics on social media.

A photo of the first daughter sitting next to Chinese President Xi Jinping, British Prime Minister Theresa May, Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan and German Chancellor Angela Merkel was first tweeted by Svetlana Lukash, who identifies herself on Twitter as a G20 Russian sherpa, a title given to people who help international delegations at large summits. The tweet has since been deleted.

It is uncommon for a member of a first family to sit in on a meeting of this level with world leaders, but Ivanka Trump serves the administration in a formal capacity as an adviser to the President.

A senior Trump administration official confirmed that Ivanka Trump had stepped in for her father, but dismissed any suggestion it was improper or unusual.

""Ivanka was sitting in the back and then briefly joined the main table when the President had to step out and the President of the World Bank started talking as the topic involved areas such as African development -- areas that will benefit from the facility just announced by the World Bank,"" the senior administration official told CNN.

""When other leaders stepped out, their seats were also briefly filled by others,"" the official noted.

Merkel said Saturday that her presence was not uncommon.

""The delegations themselves decide"" who will sit in for a President if they can't be present for a meeting, Merkel told reporters.

""Ivanka Trump was part of the American delegation, so that is something that other delegations also do, and it is very well known that she works in the White House and that she is also engaged in certain initiatives,"" Merkel said.

But Michael McFaul, the United States ambassador to Russia under President Barack Obama, said Ivanka Trump subbing in was unusual.

""This is strange,"" he tweeted . ""Very strange.""

And Brian Fallon, a CNN political commentator and former spokesman for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, tweeted , ""I'm sure Republicans would have taken it in stride if Chelsea Clinton was deputized to perform head of state duties."""
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-cyber-idUSKBN19V1C7?il=0,FOREIGN HACKERS PROBE EUROPEAN CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORKS: SOURCES,"LONDON (Reuters) - Cyber attackers are regularly trying to attack data networks connected to critical national infrastructure systems around Europe, according to current and former European government sources with knowledge of the issue. The sources acknowledged that European infrastructure data networks face regular attacks similar to those which the Washington Post newspaper said on Sunday had been launched by Russian government hackers against business systems of U.S. nuclear power and other companies involved in energy production. One former senior British security official said it was an ""article of faith"" that Russian government hackers were seeking to penetrate UK critical infrastructure though the official said he could not cite public case studies. A European security source acknowledged that UK authorities were aware of the latest reports about infrastructure hacking attempts and that British authorities were in regular contact with other governments over the attacks. UK authorities declined to comment on the extent of any such attempted or successful attacks in Britain or elsewhere in Europe or to discuss what possible security measures governments and infrastructure operators might be taking.  The Washington Post said recent attempted Russian hacking attacks on infrastructure related systems in the United States appeared to be an effort to ""assess"" such networks. But there was no evidence that hackers had actually penetrated or disrupted key systems controlling operations at nuclear plants. The Post cited several U.S. and industry officials saying that this was the first time hackers associated with the Russian government are known to have tried to get into US nuclear power companies.  The newspaper said that in late June the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the U.S. Homeland Security Department warned energy companies that unnamed foreign hackers were trying to steal login and password information so they could hack into networks. U.S. officials have acknowledged that many key computer systems which run critical infrastructure ranging from power grids to transportation networks originally were not built with strong security protection against outside hackers.  Security experts in the U.S. and Europe acknowledge that the development and evolution of security measures to protect critical infrastructure system against outside intruders has often run behind the ability of hackers to invent tools to get inside such systems.

The teen apparel retailer said Monday it has ended discussions about a possible sale. It was only two months ago that the company had put itself on the shopping block.

Shares of Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) plunged nearly 20% in early trading on the news to their lowest levels since mid-2000. The stock is now down almost 90% from the all-time highs it hit in 2007.

But A&F chairman Arthur Martinez said in a press release that the retailer ""determined that the best path to enhance value for stockholders is the rigorous execution of our business plan.""

He noted that the company's Hollister brand was showing momentum and that there were strategies in place to revitalize the core A&F brand.

Wall Street remains understandably skeptical. Shoppers have largely stayed away from the retailer.

Sales have been sluggish for years. The company reported another quarterly loss in late May and analysts expect even more red ink for all of this fiscal year as well as next.

New CEO Fran Horowitz, who was promoted from chief merchandising officer to the top spot in February, has taken steps to get the company back on track. But it's been an uphill battle.

Former CEO Mike Jeffries left the company in December 2014 after a series of controversies. Jeffries made remarks about only wanting ""cool, good-looking people"" to wear his company's clothes.

A&F was also criticized by many parents for overly sexual imagery in its marketing, with models that appeared to be very young, wearing suggestive (and little) clothing in its catalog and stores.

And an ex-pilot for the company-owned Gulfstream jet (which has since been sold) filed an age discrimination suit against A&F a few years ago. The pilot claimed Jeffries had a manual that listed dress requirements for male models working on the plane.

Related: Nightmare continues for Abercrombie & Fitch

The retailer enjoyed a brief turnaround after Jeffries left and Martinez, who led Sears (SHLD) before that once-iconic company went into its own tailspin, took over as chairman

Under Martinez, the retailer de-emphasized much of the logo-based apparel that were once hugely popular at A&F and Hollister.

But A&F's apparel no longer stands out in the crowded field of teen fashion. A&F and many other mall stalwarts have struggled to compete against the new kings of retail -- fast fashion companies like Zara, H&M and Uniqlo.

Now A&F has to convince skeptical investors that it can lure back young consumers. It won't be an easy task. The American mall has been turning into a graveyard, especially for fashion retailers.

True Religion, Wet Seal, American Apparel and Aeropostale (AROPQ) have all filed for bankruptcy recently. Gap (GPS), which also owns Old Navy and Banana Republic, is still trying to turn its fortunes around. J.Crew has announced layoffs. Bebe (BEBE) is closing shop.

And apparel companies also face a big threat from Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) -- which has been bolstering its own line of clothing -- as well as Walmart (WMT), which has recently acquired several trendy online fashion retailers."
http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/08/us/kkk-rally-charlottesville-statues/index.html,KKK RALLY IN CHARLOTTESVILLE OUTNUMBERED BY COUNTERPROTESTERS,"(CNN) A Ku Klux Klan rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, drew about 50 Klan members and supporters Saturday -- and several hundred counterprotesters, authorities said.

Members of the North Carolina-based Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan -- some wearing Klan robes and carrying Confederate flags -- arrived in midday to protest the city's plan to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a park, one of several steps the city is taking to reduce its number of Confederate monuments.

Some Klansmen had said they would carry loaded firearms -- allowable under Virginia's open-carry law.

They were confronted by shouting counterprotesters as tensions ratcheted up and a large group of law enforcement officers, including members of the state police, set up police lines.

Police escorted the Klansmen through the shouting crowds to reach their designated spot for a demonstration: Justice Park, which until recently had been named after Confederate hero Gen. Stonewall Jackson.

About 1,000 counterprotesters were there, said city spokeswoman Miriam Dickler.

Shouting ""racists go home,"" the crowd drowned out the Klansmen's chants of ""white power."" Despite police lines, a few brief scuffles broke out. Counterprotesters tried to stop the Klansmen from entering and leaving the park, video showed.

After about 40 minutes, police helped the KKK members push through the crowd to reach their vehicles, Dickler said. Some protesters tried to block the Klan vehicles and police then declared the gathering an unlawful assembly, Dickler said.

As police began to move back toward Justice Park, a large crowd followed, Dickler said. There were a number of incidents, including the use of pepper spray by the crowd, Dickler said. When the crowd didn't follow orders to disperse, state police released three canisters of tear gas and the crowd left, Dickler said.

Officers clash with counter protestors who turned out in reaction to a KKK rally.

She said three people were taken to the hospital -- two for heat-related issues and one for alcohol usage.

Twenty-two people were arrested. Police originally said 23 people were arrested but one person was counted twice.

It was not clear what they were charged with or whether those arrested were Klan supporters, counterprotesters or some from each group.

The Loyal White Knights of the KKK said the rally was called to support Southern heritage, CNN affiliate WVIR reported

""They're trying to erase our history, and it's not right what they're doing,"" Klansman Douglas Barker said.

The city and the University of Virginia had urged people not to go to the Klan rally, even if they opposed the Klan, but to attend alternative events, such as a unity concert at a school. The local chapter of the NAACP also organized a counter-rally.

A counter protestor is arrested Saturday in Charlottesville.

""Throughout the day, we urged folks not to take the bait -- to deny the KKK the confrontation and celebrity they desire,"" Mayor Mike Signer said on his Facebook page. ""Thousands of people followed that advice, attending a wonderful set of alternative events. ...""

Charlottesville, home of the University of Virginia, has, like many cities and towns, grappled with what to do with its Confederate monuments.

""Charlottesville has kind of been put on the map recently,"" the mayor said earlier in the day. ""We want to change the narrative by telling the true story of race through public spaces. That has made us a target for groups that hate that change and want to stay in the past, but we will not be intimidated.""

The city council voted in April to remove the Lee statue and sell it by taking bids, CNN affiliate WVIR reported . Lee Park, where that statue stands, was renamed Emancipation Park.

Those efforts were praised by the local chapter of the NAACP, which said in a statement: ""The NAACP has committed to removing and advocating the removal of Confederate symbols, including statues and from flags in cities all around the nation.

http://cnn.com/2017/07/06/us/delta-flight-passenger-cockpit/index.html,"DELTA PASSENGER TRIED TO OPEN DOOR IN FLIGHT, COMPLAINT ALLEGES","Seattle (CNN) An unruly passenger who authorities say was trying to open an exit door on a Delta Air Lines flight to Beijing fought with the cabin crew and a passenger and was conked over the head by a flight attendant with two wine bottles, a criminal complaint alleges.

Joseph Daniel Hudek IV, a 23-year-old passenger from Florida, was arrested after the plane returned to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, FBI spokeswoman Ayn Dietrich-Williams said.

The suspect made an initial appearance in federal court Friday in Seattle, hearing the criminal complaint of one count of interfering with a flight crew. That carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison and fines up to $250,000.

A Delta Air Lines flight from Seattle to Beijing turned back after takeoff Thursday evening after a passenger assaulted a flight-crew member -- an incident that left both people and another passenger injured -- FBI and airport representatives said.

The battle in the galley near the cockpit of Delta Flight 129, which was headed to Beijing with 210 passengers and 11 crew aboard, began as the airliner cruised near Canada's western coast about an hour into the flight.

According to a criminal complaint released Friday, Hudek -- who was traveling in first class on a dependent travel pass, a perk afforded to family members employed by the airline -- attempted to open the forward exit door on the right side of the airliner.

Two flight attendants tried to subdue Hudek but were pushed away, and he continued his attempt to open the door. According to the complaint, Hudek was able to move the door handle mechanism and push the emergency release lever halfway.

Aircraft cabin doors cannot be opened at high altitudes because of the differing pressures inside and outside the jet's cabin, and the Delta plane was cruising at high altitude, at 32,000 feet, when the incident happened. However, at a lower altitude, according to the complaint, it was possible the door might open.

The flight attendants then signaled to passengers they needed help. During the altercation, Hudek punched a flight attendant twice in the face and hit another assisting passenger with a bottle of wine. Hudek then attempted again to open the exit door.

As the struggle continued, another flight attendant grabbed two wine bottles and struck Hudek in the head, breaking one.

""Hudek did not seem impacted by the breaking of a full-liter red wine bottle over his head, and instead, shouted 'Do you know who I am?"" or something to that extent,"" according to the complaint. Hudek was able to break away several times during the altercation.

Several first-class passengers and the flight attendants eventually were able to restrain Hudek long enough to put zip-tie handcuffs on him. He remained ""extremely combative"" all the way back to Seattle and needed to be restrained by multiple passengers until the Delta flight landed, according to the complaint.

Three injuries

The Boeing 767-300ER, which had taken off at 5:24 p.m. PT, turned back and landed at Sea-Tac airport at 7:09 p.m. PT, flight-tracking website FlightAware shows.

The flight attendant and a passenger were taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, airport spokesman Perry Cooper said, without giving further details about the injuries.

Hudek was also injured, but declined treatment from medics and was taken into custody, Cooper said.

The flight departed again for Beijing shortly after midnight local time Friday.

Safe return

Delta described the event as a ""security incident with a passenger.""

""The passenger was restrained onboard and was removed from the flight by law enforcement without further incident when the aircraft arrived back at Seattle,"" the airline said in a prepared statement.

There were conflicting reports soon after the incident. Initially, two people familiar with it told CNN on condition of anonymity that the man tried to enter the cockpit, but the altercation took place just outside the cockpit door in the forward galley.

But Cooper subsequently said that was incorrect, and he and Dietrich-Williams described the incident only as an assault on a crew member.

Dietrich-Williams, the FBI spokeswoman, added there was no information to suggest that there was a national security threat.

The two people also initially said that the Boeing 767 returned to the airport under a Department of Defense escort.

But representatives from Delta and the North American Aerospace Defense Command said no such escort happened.

Lt. Commander Joe Nawrocki, a NORAD spokesman, clarified that jets were ready on the runway, but never took off. Air traffic control recordings from LiveATC.net indicated that F-15s at Portland International Airport were preparing to meet the Delta flight, but never departed.

The FBI Seattle field office maintains a regular presence at the airport, and assisted in interviewing passengers from the flight, Dietrich-Williams said.

http://cnn.com/2017/07/08/europe/g20-merkel-trump-communique/index.html,G20 CLOSES WITH REBUKE TO TRUMP'S CLIMATE STANCE,"Hamburg, Germany (CNN) German Chancellor Angela Merkel closed the G20 summit in Hamburg with a rebuke to President Donald Trump's stance on climate change, but the group of the world's economic leaders appeared to make a concession on his protectionist trade policies.

Officials had been at an impasse over an increasingly isolationist United States and Trump's climate change and trade policies for most of the summit, and Merkel made it clear the United States had made talks difficult.

""Unfortunately -- and I deplore this -- the United States of America left the climate agreement, or rather announced their intention of doing this,"" Merkel said as she closed the summit and presented a G20 declaration.

She said the other 19 members of the G20, which includes the European Union, agreed that the Paris climate accord was irreversible and that they remained committed to it.

Trump faced global outrage last month when he announced he would withdraw the United States from the agreement, which obliges countries to reduce their carbon emissions to ward off catastrophic global warming.

The G20 declaration noted the US withdrawal from the accord but said the country affirmed its ""strong commitment to an approach that lowers emissions while supporting economic growth and improving energy security needs.""

After the summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin called climate change a ""major issue"" and said Merkel had reached a ""good compromise.""

""Although the US will withdraw, they are nevertheless still prepared to carry on now (with) discussions on this subject. It seems to me this is a very positive point and can be chalked up to the successes of Angela Merkel,"" Putin said.

British Prime Minister Theresa May said that she was dismayed at the US climate stance and that she had urged Trump to reconsider.

And Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that ""strong economic growth and environmental protection can go hand in hand.""

""This is the narrative that we have been sharing ... and was enthusiastically supported by just about everyone here at the G20.""

Backtrack on trade

In her remarks, Merkel appeared to come down hard on Trump's protectionist trade policies, saying she was glad that leaders agreed that ""markets need to be kept open.""

""This is all about fighting protectionism and also unfair trade practices,"" she said.

But the declaration made concessions for ""the role of legitimate trade defense instruments"" in a sign that leaders had given into the United States.

Trump won the 2016 election on an ""America First"" platform and vowed to pull the country out of several multilateral trade deals and negotiations.

The United States has threatened to impose new tariffs on steel imports, a position that prompted European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to threaten the same in return, raising fears of a trade war.

Trump-Putin meeting

Much of the attention at the G20 was on Friday's bilateral meeting between Trump and Putin.

Putin told reporters Saturday that Trump appeared to agree with Moscow's position that it did not interfere in last year's election.

JUST WATCHED Putin: I think Trump agreed Russia didn't meddle Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Putin: I think Trump agreed Russia didn't meddle 01:13

""I repeat, he asked a lot of questions on this matter,"" Putin said at a Saturday press conference. ""I answered as many as I could answer. I think he took it into consideration and agreed with it. But you should ask him what his opinion is on that.""

On Friday, a senior administration official told CNN that Trump did not accept Putin's claim of noninterference in the US election.

Regarding his personal relationship with Trump, the Russian President said, ""I think it was established. I don't know how this will sound, but I'll tell you how I see it. TV Trump is very different from the real person; he is absolutely specific, absolutely adequate in his perception of the dialogue partner. He analyzes things quickly, replies to the raised questions or new elements of the conversation. So I think if our future relations will unfold the same way as our meeting yesterday, there is every reason to believe that we can restore, at least partially, the level of cooperation we need.""

The G20 summit has been marked by protests against capitalism, globalization, climate change and the concentration of power among the 20 nations in the group. They have been violent at times.

The Hamburg police said that more than 200 police officers have been injured and that 114 people have been arrested. Another 89 were taken into temporary custody. It was not clear how many protesters were injured. Around 1,000 police officers arrived in Hamburg to support security forces.

Future meetings

With Trump aboard, Air Force One departed from Germany and was expected to arrive at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington on Saturday evening.

In a declaration issued at the end of the G20 summit, the group announced that Saudi Arabia will host the conference in 2020. Argentina will host the 2018 G20 and Japan the 2019 event, according to the declaration."

In a statement, Lenkov said departing actors Daniel Dae Kim and Grace Park were offered ""unprecedented"" raises, but ultimately chose to move on.

""The truth is this: Both actors chose not to extend their contracts. CBS was extremely generous and proactive in their renegotiation talks,"" Lenkov wrote in a statement posted to social media.

This echos a statement released by CBS late Wednesday, in which the network said it ""tried very hard"" to keep the actors, who were the most prominent actors of color on the series, by offering them ""large and significant salary increases.""

Jeff Yang: For Asian actors, more success comes when they step behind the camera and help to create their own projects

Jeff Yang is a frequent contributor to CNN Opinion, a featured writer for Quartz and other publications and the cohost of the podcast They Call Us Bruce. He co-authored Jackie Chan's bestselling autobiography, ""I Am Jackie Chan"" and is the editor of three graphic novels: ""Secret Identities,"" ""Shattered"" and the forthcoming ""New Frontiers."" The opinions expressed here are his own.

(CNN) It's been a little more than a week since word leaked that Daniel Dae Kim and Grace Park were leaving CBS's resilient hit ""Hawaii Five-0,"" and pieces of the story behind the story have begun to fall into place. The picture that's emerging isn't pretty.

As Kim himself confirmed in a Facebook post to his fans, the duo left because their request to be paid the same as their white co-stars, Alex O'Loughlin and Scott Caan, was rejected. The gap in what they were asking for and what CBS was willing to offer was tiny Ã¢ÂÂ reportedly a difference of as little as $5,000 per episode , which for the most-watched network in America is an amount that could basically be found under sofa cushions in their corporate offices.

Jeff Yang

Although, according to ""Hawaii Five-0"" showrunner Peter Lenkov, the raise in CBS's final offer to Kim and Park was ""generous,"" money in Hollywood isn't just about money. It also reflects respect for an artist's importance to a show's success. And that aspect of the negotiations clearly served as the sticking point for Kim and Park, the two prominent Asian American faces of a show whose very identity is defined by its Asian and Pacific Islander-majority locale.

Ultimately, the refusal to pay Kim and Park on matching terms with O'Loughlin and Caan was CBS's formal declaration that they were determined to protect a disparity that has been a sore point since the show's premiere: The assertion that O'Loughlin and Caan are ""Hawaii Five-0"" ""stars,"" and Kim and Park are merely ""co-leads.""

It's hard to avoid concluding that this is a direct reflection of Hollywood's continuing legacy as a system where white actors and male actors are seen as more valuable than nonwhite and female ones, simply by accident of melanin and genitalia."
http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/05/technology/electric-cars-vs-gas-cars/index.html?section=money_topstories,WHY GAS-POWERED CARS AREN'T GOING AWAY,"The internal combustion engine has been around more than a century. And it should be around for decades to come, despite Volvo's announcement Wednesday that it will move away from cars powered only by gasoline.

""It's hard to find technology that is better suited for cars,"" said Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst for Kelley Blue Book. ""The idea that we are moving completely away from internal combustion is completely exaggerated.""

There is no doubt that electric cars are becoming more popular. Prices are becoming more competitive with traditional gasoline-powered cars.

And Lindland and other experts say several factors will move the industry toward even greater use of electric motors, including tougher environmental regulations and the desire for self-driving cars, which will need more electrical juice for all their computing needs.

But eliminating the gas engine altogether will be difficult, if not impossible.

The first reason is profitability. The stock of tiny Tesla (TSLA) may be worth more than either General Motors (GM) or Ford (F), but it has yet to report an annual profit. Traditional automakers are making billions of dollars selling millions of gasoline-powered cars each. No one has yet figured out a way to make a profit selling electric-only vehicles.

It was only recently that anyone offered an electric-only car at a competitive price that can go more than 200 miles on a single charge. The Chevrolet Bolt went on sale late last year, and the Tesla Model 3 will soon start rolling off the production line. Those companies will at least initially lose money on those cars.

Volvo: Gas-only cars are history after 2019

The cost of making those electric cars should be coming down as production of the cars and their key components, such as lithium ion batteries, increases. But costs aren't coming down nearly as fast as they did for other types of technology -- say, for new computer chips.

And the market share for pure-electric vehicles will be tied directly to battery costs, Ron Cogan, editor and publisher of Green Car Journal.

""We have not seen the cost come down to the point they need to for mass market sales,"" he said. ""It's really hard to predict.""

Gasoline-powered cars themselves are becoming far more efficient, thanks to new technology and new materials. No one anticipates that gasoline engines will be regulated out of existence.

""I don't expect internal combustion to go away any time soon,"" Cogan said. ""It keeps getting better and better and better.""

Related: Trump might ease fuel economy rules, but automakers won't be off the hook

For that matter, even Volvo isn't dropping gas-powered engines completely. Many of the cars Volvo plans to sell will be hybrids, not pure electric cars. The Swedish automaker, now owned by Chinese automaker Geely, has yet to offer an electric-only car.

Volvo is something of a trendsetter. It was one of the first automakers to stress safety features as part of its marketing. But it is still only a niche player, with global sales of just over 500,000 vehicles. Even if Volvo reaches its target of selling 800,000 cars a year by 2020, that will be less than 1% of sales across the industry.

""If GM, Toyota (TM) or Volkswagen (VLKAF) made the same statement as Volvo, it would be a bigger deal,"" Lindland said. ""Those larger automakers might be moving in that direction, but they're not getting there any time soon."""

US-led airstrikes breached the 1,300-year-old Rafiqah Wall on Monday and allowed the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to enter the city from the south. CNN is the first Western media organization to film inside the fortification since then.

After pushing through one of two small gaps in the wall, CNN journalists met with the rebels leading the assault just 200 meters from ISIS positions, as they heard gunfire and explosions nearby.

The rebels have seized control of territory around 300 meters into the Old City since Monday, but have been confronted with fierce resistance from ISIS.

CNN saw US forces in this area and it appears they have been calling in the airstrikes that have cleared the way for the rebels' advances. US personnel did not want to be filmed.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-hedgefunds-thirdpoint-idUSKBN19V1DD?il=0,ACTIVIST LOEB KEEPS UP PERFORMANCE PRESSURE ON NESTLE: SOURCE,"LONDON (Reuters) - Activist investor Daniel Loeb is keeping up pressure on Nestle (NESN.S) by sharing views with the company as part of a regular dialogue, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Nestle, Europe's most valuable public company, announced a 20 billion Swiss franc ($21 billion) share buyback program last month coupled with a plan to increase leverage and prioritize acquisitions in high-growth areas as it battles slowing demand for packaged food. The move came just two days after the billionaire hedge fund manager urged Nestle to more aggressively improve returns as his Third Point fund revealed a $3.5 billion stake that made it Nestle's eighth-largest shareholder. But Nestle's plan did not address Loeb's calls for it to exit its $26 billion stake in French cosmetics giant L'Oreal (OREP.PA) or set a formal margin target of 18 to 20 percent by 2020, up from 15.3 percent in 2016. Unilever (ULVR.L) and Danone (DANO.PA) have recently set their own respective 2020 margin targets of 20 percent and more than 16 percent. Some analysts now expect Nestle to set, or at least imply, a long-term margin target at its Sept. 26 investor seminar, when new chief executive Mark Schneider will lay out his plans. ""Third Point's stake may add urgency to margin delivery and sharpens focus on the September investor days,"" Liberum analysts said.     Loeb's move on Nestle comes months after Unilever fended off a surprise $143 billion takeover approach from Kraft Heinz (KHC.O). Both events highlight the magnitude of the trouble rocking the packaged food sector, as a new generation of consumers flock to smaller brands, leaving companies racing to improve profits through cost cuts. Nestle has a cost-savings program but has not said how much of this will go toward raising its margins, which are at the low end of its peer group. Improved productivity was first on Third Point's wish list, and the source, who declined to be identified, said it was the most important.  Loeb, dubbed a ""constructivist"" for his increasingly cooperative approach, first met Schneider on June 2, the source said, adding that no other meetings are currently planned before the September seminar, which Third Point plans to attend. Third Point generally agrees with the direction Nestle is heading in under its new CEO, the first outside leader in nearly a century, said the source, but it wants to see greater urgency. Aside from the share buyback, Schneider, who became CEO in January, has already scrapped a long-term sales model and announced a review of Nestle's U.S. confectionery business.  Third Point, which has not commented publicly on Nestle's plans, may give an update in its quarterly letter due later this month, the source said, adding that its plan was to keep sharing its views and talking to the company.  It has suggested that Nestle review its portfolio, which includes more than 2,000 brands including Maggi, Gerber, Perrier and Nescafe. It wants a divestiture of the L'Oreal stake, and has floated an exchange offer whereby Nestle shareholders are offered shares of L'Oreal, maker of Maybelline make-up. Nestle has not commented on this, but behind closed doors, its board does not seem keen, the source said, confirming what another source had previously told Reuters. Nestle, which has owned the stake for more than four decades, has long touted it as strategic and value-creating, and a source last month told Reuters that view had not changed. After carefully assessing all companies in the sector, including Unilever, Third Point started buying Nestle shares earlier this year, when the stock was trading above 70 Swiss francs per share, the source said, noting that Nestle had the greatest opportunity for upside. The shares jumped 4 percent to a record high the day Third Point's letter was disclosed and the stock was trading at 82.90 francs per share at 1559 GMT, up 1.3 percent.  That stands to boost Third Point's performance, which is already outshining its rivals this year. For example, Loeb's Ultra fund, which is invested in Nestle, gained 0.9 percent in June, taking its year-to-date performance to 17.2 percent, said the source.  That compares to an average activist hedge fund performance of 1.27 percent in June and 4.21 percent for the year, according to industry tracker Hedge Fund Research. Since founding Third Point in 1995, Loeb has campaigned for changes at companies such as Yahoo Inc YHOO.O and Sothebys and famously brought his tactics to Japan via now-exited positions in Sony Corp (6758.T) and Seven & I Holdings (3382.T).

Apollo is gaining hundreds of thousands of members in the bargain, providing a steady source of cash.The deal follows a challenging stretch for the golf industry, which saw participation decline after a peak in 2003. Hundreds of courses have closed in recent years, and the slump rocked both retailers and equipment manufacturers. Golfsmith International, the biggest golf chain, filed for bankruptcy last year. And Nike Inc., which had hitched its golf fortunes to Tiger Woodss career, stopped selling equipment for the sport.But golfs core participants remain enthusiastic, and Apollo is getting ClubCorps more than 430,000 members -- an affluent and reliable set of customers.We plan to leverage Apollos resources and expertise while working with ClubCorps dedicated team to continue to grow the business, David Sambur, a senior partner at Apollo, said in a statement Sunday.Golf Is Elitist, Hard, In Decline, But Does It Care?: QuickTakeClubCorps investors will receive $17.12 a share in cash in the transaction, a 31 percent premium over the closing stock price on July 7. The shares rose to $17.06 on Monday, just short of the deal price.The nature of ClubCorps business makes it a logical target for a private equity firm, Stifel Financial Corp. analyst Steven Wieczynski said in a note. The question is whether investors are getting a fair price, he said. The transaction equates to a roughly 7.5 multiple on estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for 2018. He sees a multiple of as much as 8.5 -- equivalent to a price of $20 a share -- as a better representation of ClubCorps steady business.Takeover speculation began heating up in January, when Dallas-based ClubCorp announced that it had hired Jefferies Group and Wells Fargo & Co. to evaluate options. In May, the company added two new independent contractors in an agreement with activist shareholder FrontFour Capital Group.The company had attracted critics who said golfs decline would hamstring the business. Last year, short seller Kerrisdale Capital Management targeted ClubCorp, noting that participation in golf was shrinking, particularly among younger players, and that operating golf clubs was a capital-intensive business.Prior to the deal announcement, the shares had declined about 25 percent since reaching a closing high this year on Feb. 21 -- the day before ClubCorp reported weak fourth-quarter earnings.Founded in 1957, the company owns or operates more than 200 private golf, country and private clubs. Its properties include the Firestone Country Club in Akron, Ohio, and the Capital Club Beijing. The transaction is slated to close in the fourth quarter.Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP acted as legal counsel for ClubCorp. Citigroup Inc. was lead financial adviser to Apollo, with RBC Capital Markets LLC, Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse Group AG and Deutsche Bank AG assisting. Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison LLP acted as Apollos legal counsel.The deal for ClubCorp is the latest in a string of take-private transactions for New York-based Apollo, which deployed more money last year than ever in its history. Apollo scooped up public companies including ADT Corp., Fresh Market Inc., Diamond Resorts International Inc., Outerwall Inc. and Rackspace Hosting Inc. In May, the firm agreed to buy communications infrastructure provider West Corp. for about $5.1 billion including debt and earlier this month, completed its acquisition of Lumileds, the lighting-components division it carved out of Royal Philips NV.To replenish its coffers, the firm has set a $23.5 billion cap on its new global buyout fund. The pool, the firms ninth, will be the largest ever raised by a private equity firm if it exceeds the $21.7 billion that Blackstone Group LP gathered for its fifth pool from 2005 to 2007.Apollo, led by founders Leon Black, Josh Harris and Marc Rowan, oversaw $197.5 billion in private equity holdings, credit assets and real estate as of March 31."

Thats fairly atypical.While headhunters can get lofty retainers for executive positions, a 16-year low unemployment rate and a record-high number of job openings are turning workers across all sorts of industries -- from construction to trucking to software engineering -- into hot commodities. The need is so dire that employers are handing out large signing bonuses, giving second looks to people with blemishes on their resumes and reaching out to professional recruiters more than ever.The numbers show why thats the case: There were 1.17 unemployed job seekers for every vacancy in April, the second-lowest ratio in data going back to 2000. That compares with a post-recession peak of 6.65 people per job opening in July 2009. Revenue for U.S. search-and-placement services rose to $21.9 billion in 2016, almost triple the level in 2009, according to estimates from the American Staffing Association.Its a candidate-driven market and companies are scrambling, said Jennifer Pearce, vice president at City Staff, a Washington-based firm that places about 400 new hires a year, including people who work in international development and at non-profit organizations. Its now become equally important for a company to keep employees interested and challenged to keep them from getting bored and accepting other offers.The tight job market means employers are hiring at a slower pace, albeit still a solid one. U.S. employers are estimating a payrolls increase of about 177,000 positions in June, after 138,000 in May, based on the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey ahead of Fridays Labor Department report. For the full year, economists project an average monthly increase of 167,000 jobs, down from 187,000 in 2016. The unemployment rate is estimated to have held at 4.3 percent.Wage gains probably accelerated in June, rising 0.3 percent from the previous month, according to the median estimate. That would match the fastest pace in 2017, though year-over-year pay growth forecast at 2.6 percent remains below the 2.9 percent peak of the eight-year expansion.Weve got a tight labor market and job growth will slow this year because businesses are finding it difficult to hire, said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group Inc. in Pittsburgh. At some point businesses are going to be forced to raise pay as they see their workers leaving for somewhere else.Discouraged by meager pay raises, workers are changing jobs and finding its paying off. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta data show job switchers enjoyed 3.9 percent higher pay than a year earlier, according to a three-month average of median wage growth as of May, while people who remained in the same job saw only a 3 percent increase.Glenn Murphy, partner at recruiter Bamboo Talent in New York, says theres so much work to go around that technology companies -- who once would offer the firm retainer fees for only the highest level of talent -- are now offering to pay upfront for a variety of roles, from chief technology officers down to vice presidents, directors and engineering managers. A strong engineering candidate can probably get a dozen messages a day from recruiters and companies on LinkedIn, he said.Those headhunters are finding more and more success. The number of Americans voluntarily leaving their jobs -- for opportunities such as a new job or going back to school -- is close to its high for this expansion. The quits rate, as its known, was at 2.1 percent in April, compared to 1.3 percent at the start of 2010.To some extent, the labor shortage is a function of employers having unrealistic expectations of what they can get, said Steven Berchem, chief operating officer at the American Staffing Association in Alexandria, Virginia. They have to realize you have to open their pocketbooks to get the talent that they really want.That makes the outlook for recruiters sunny -- if they can find people to do the recruiting.The economy is, if not at full employment, very close, said Ryan Sweet, an economist at Moodys Analytics Inc. in West Chester, Pennsylvania, Its going to be harder and harder and its going to take longer and longer to fill positions."

The SNPL union is consulting its members on the plan and will announce the result on July 17.The remarks show just how much prospects have changed since December, when Janaillac gave a downbeat assessment, warning against the challenges of weak margins, rising fuel prices and high debt.

Passenger numbers at the Air France arm dropped 1.4 percent last year, and the group relied on Transavia and Dutch KLM for gains.Our goal is to find the ways of profitable growth, he said. Boost is a way to get back to 3 percent per year in long-haul growth, which is something we havent known for years."
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-portugal-bonds-china-idUSKBN19O1S0?il=0,PORTUGAL'S BOND WITH CHINA: PIONEERING DEBT SALE FOUNDED ON CLOSE TIES,"LONDON (Reuters) - Portugal is looking to build on its economic and cultural ties with China by becoming the first euro zone country to borrow in the $9.5 trillion Chinese bond market, potentially opening the way for other European governments. Beijing is tentatively removing barriers to foreign issuers as it seeks to internationalize its renminbi or yuan currency and open up sources of finance for its planned ""One Belt, One Road"" trade route that stretches as far as Europe. Portugal, whose location on Europe's Atlantic coast is some 10,000 km (6,250 miles) from Beijing, further away than any of its euro zone peers, plans to sell ""Panda"" bonds -- debt sold by foreign entities to investors in mainland China.  ""In practical terms, the issue aims to diversify the sources of financing of Portugal, opening a new market for its debt, and support the internationalization of the (renminbi),"" a spokesman for the office of Prime Minister Antonio Costa told Reuters. He said strengthening trade links between the two countries would benefit both populations. Just a handful of foreign entities -- including sovereigns Poland and South Korea -- have sold Panda bonds in recent years, although Hong Kong's smaller, offshore, yuan-denominated ""dim sum"" market is well established. Panda bond issuance increased ninefold last year to 130 billion yuan ($19 billion), and is expected to grow by another 50 percent in 2017, according to JPMorgan.   Portugal's ties with China date back some 500 years to the settlement of Macau, the trading post-turned-gambling hub that was Europe's last colony in Asia until it was handed back to China in 1999, just as Portugal joined the euro. After a crippling recession that pushed the indebted country into a bailout in 2011, Chinese cash helped aid its recovery.   Portugal is currently the top destination for Chinese investment in Europe as a share of its economy, according to figures from Spain's ESADE Business & Law School, and a number of Chinese firms have taken stakes in Portuguese companies. China Three Gorges owns 21 percent of Energias de Portugal while private conglomerate Fosun (0656.HK) upped its stake in bank Millennium bcp (BCP.LS) to 24 percent in February. Last year, Costa told Chinese state television that Portugal wanted to ""actively participate"" in Beijing's plans to develop a maritime sea route as part of the trade route initiative, dubbed the new Silk Road. He highlighted port capacity at Sines in Portugal's south. Hong Kong-based Richard Mazzochi of law firm KWM, who has been involved in a number of Panda bond deals, said linking to a specific project could help get Portugal's planned debt sale off the ground.      ""Applications are easier to make where there is already an established connection and if an issuer would use the proceeds in connection with One Belt, One Road initiatives, that would be helpful,"" he said.  A deal could raise eyebrows among European authorities suspicious of China's plans to spread its global influence and concerned about transparency and access for foreign firms to the scheme. Major European countries have even mooted the idea of blocking Chinese investment on the continent. The EU is assessing whether a Beijing-funded rail project in Hungary, which has issued debt in Chinas offshore market and is eyeing the onshore market, complies with EU law. Finance Minister Mario Centeno told Reuters in May that selling a bond in the Chinese currency would allow Portugal to take advantage of growing demand for its debt, especially as a strengthening economy raises hopes for a credit rating upgrade.   The planned end in December of the European Central Bank's bond-buying scheme means diversifying into China -- the world's third-biggest debt market, behind the United States and Japan -- might appeal to other euro zone states.      Contacted by Reuters, the debt offices of Ireland, Italy and Belgium said they were open to issuing in yuan, while France, Spain and the Netherlands said they had no such plans. A German government source said such a transaction ""had been on the table one or two years ago"" but for ""cost reasons"" Berlin decided against it. Bankers at Standard Chartered and HSBC told Reuters they were working with European sovereigns on deals, but gave no details. Although China is nervous about capital outflows, a foreign government issuing there would serve as an endorsement of plans to internationalize the currency and its standing as a global economic power.      Mushtaq Kapasi, chief representative, Asia-Pacific at the International Capital Market Association, said Portugal's sovereign would also ""give Chinese investors a level of trust"".  In October, the yuan was added to the International Monetary Fund's small basket of reserve currencies, while the ECB added the Chinese currency to its foreign reserves this year. Spencer Maclean, a banker at Standard Chartered, said a sovereign bond sale would be a ""precursor"" for private firms from the country to tap Chinese markets. But barriers to entry remain. Bankers told Reuters that some countries may be nervous about the legal framework under which the bonds would be sold.  As Greece and Argentina experienced during their debt crises, it is hard to restructure bonds issued under foreign law.  The most common concern expressed by issuers is whether they  will be able to get the cash they have borrowed out of China. ""The Chinese allow capital to flow in but it is still quite a challenging situation to convince the Chinese to use the proceeds abroad,"" said Alexander Liebethal, head of new issues at German development bank KfW, which has issued in the Chinese offshore market.  ""If you look at the Panda market you will see a lot of issuers active there that have operations in China, like some German car manufacturers.""  New guidelines on Panda bonds expected from Chinese regulators should add some clarity, bankers and lawyers said.  And for all that Portugal's deal is innovative, it may not be imminent. ""These sort of projects take time,"" said Portugal's debt agency chief Cristina Casalinho. ""It would be a novelty for us.""

http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/10/middleeast/mosul-what-next/index.html,MOSUL NOW FREED FROM ISIS: WHAT'S NEXT FOR THE CITY LEFT IN RUINS?,"(CNN) Flanked by Iraqi forces of all stripes, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared Mosul has been recaptured from ISIS.

""From here, from the heart of the liberated and free Mosul, by the sacrifices of the Iraqis from all the provinces, we declare the great victory for all of Iraq and Iraqis,"" al-Abadi announced Monday.

""This is a great celebration that crowned the victories of the fighters and the Iraqis over the last three years.""

The US-led coalition fighting ISIS, Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve , congratulated Iraqi security forces ""on their remarkable progress against ISIS while making extraordinary efforts to safeguard civilian lives.""

The victory marks an end to a nine-month operation, which began when fighters of different ethnic and religious backgrounds made a coordinated push toward the city as US-led airstrikes helped pave their way.

Iraqi forces planted a national flag on the banks of the Tigris River in Mosul's Old City to declare their victory, although fighting was still underway in one small pocket of the city Monday morning.

The victory marks the beginning of a long, arduous road to rebuilding the metropolis. Much of the historic city is reduced to rubble and is still under threat of ISIS attacks.

Soon, Iraqi officials and Mosul residents -- as well as their US allies -- will need to start looking at a long and challenging to-do list.

Rebuilding a city torn to shreds

CNN journalists in Mosul's historic Old City saw a place almost entirely reduced to rubble on Monday.

Very few civilians remain in the area -- there is simply nowhere for them to live -- but some were seen trying to return, even visiting the ruins of the Al-Nuri Mosque, which was blown up by ISIS last month

JUST WATCHED Mosul's Great Mosque of al-Nuri blown up Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mosul's Great Mosque of al-Nuri blown up 02:22

Fawaz Gerges, a Middle East expert at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said that there was no time to waste in beginning social and physical reconstruction.

""The first challenge facing the Iraqi government and international organizations is to provide basic necessities of life for more than 400,000 Iraqis who have been displaced from the western part of Mosul, which mostly lies in ruins,"" Gerges told CNN.

He estimated that rebuilding the Old City alone would cost $1 billion.

In some parts of Mosul, residents have begun to return from displacement camps to think about rebuilding. CNN drove through some of these areas, and saw signs of life returning to normal -- traffic on the roads and chickens being sold in makeshift markets.

Some people have left their villages for safer ones -- like Taysir Mohammed Mahmoud, a former restaurant owner who left the Old City for the safer east with his wife, two children, brother and mother.

He and his family had been used as human shields by militants and were forced to move to another place, where they lived with 10 other families in a basement for five months, he told the UN refugee agency.

""Thank God we are here. We'll celebrate our new birth,"" says Mahmoud, who lost his home in the fighting.

""But we will need help ... help to go back, rebuild and get back to work.""

Holding ground and security

In the push toward Mosul, forces retook dozens of villages in their path from ISIS fighters. In many cases, the militants simply fled and returned when security forces had moved on. In some cases, they came back to carry out mass executions of civilians.

Iraq and its allies will have to work on creating a strong and permanent security presence in Mosul to ensure this does not happen.

JUST WATCHED Iraq declares end of ISIS control in Mosul Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Iraq declares end of ISIS control in Mosul 02:57

""We all know that ISIS hides among civilian populations and ISIS will be counting on sympathies among certain individuals in the civilian population to operate an insurgency,"" said Lina Khatib, head of the Middle East and North Africa Program at Chatham House in London.

""So it is very important for Iraqi officials to gain the trust of the civilian population to make sure this doesn't happen.""

The US has been heavily criticized for leaving Iraq in a weakened position after its invasion in 2003 and ensuing war. Some critics say that US actions aimed at eradicating al Qaeda in Iraq created the vacuum for ISIS to gain a foothold in the country -- Mosul was the militant group's largest city and its crown jewel.

US officials are aware of the risk of history repeating. They are engaging more with tribal leaders to make sure they have the local buy-in to make sure a new incarnation of ISIS does not find a space in Mosul again.

Iraqi forces celebrate the retaking of Mosul on Sunday.

Gerges warned that the US must learn lessons from the Iraq war.

""To the Trump administration, one warning is in order: Defeating ISIS militarily is not enough. Al Qaeda in Iraq was defeated between 2007 and 2010, yet it made a spectacular return,"" Gerges said to CNN.

The US said last winter that it was helping to train some 15,000 members of a Sunni Iraqi tribal militia to hold the city, but some Iraqi officials have told CNN that they didn't think there had been much progress so far. It's unclear whether that force is ready to be fully deployed.

Parts of eastern Mosul that have been retaken from ISIS are not exactly peaceful. While ISIS has lost its control there, attacks continue and terror-related arrests are still being made.

It is the same story in other areas captured from ISIS. The town of Fallujah was retaken in the summer of 2016, but nine months later the mayor had still not returned to live there because of the insecure situation.

Working out who's going to rule

Perhaps one of the biggest challenges on the to-do list is to work out who will be in charge of what.

Talks on who is going to rule Mosul are on the front burner, but a source close to the issue told CNN that essentially nothing had yet been agreed on how the city should be run.

A commission established to discuss these issues has never met, the source said, nor is there an agreement on any form of power sharing among the many groups in Nineveh province.

JUST WATCHED Can ISIS ever be eradicated? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Can ISIS ever be eradicated? 01:34

US and Iraqi officials have spoken of creating eight self-governing areas in and around Mosul. Ever since Iraq's new constitution was passed, there's been much talk of local autonomy, but it's rarely been delivered.

Mosul is made up of a diverse group of people with different ethnic and religious backgrounds -- including Sunni and Shia Muslims, Christians, Kurds and Yazidis -- and in the past, the lack of Sunni Muslims in governance has been a source of tension and conflict. ISIS was able to play on this issue and find sympathy among Sunni Muslims in Mosul.

But al-Abadi has tried hard to brand the fight against ISIS as a national one, involving a range of ethno-religious groups fighting under one national Iraqi flag.

Nonetheless, the extensive role of the Popular Mobilization Units -- which are made up of predominantly Shia groups -- in the ISIS fight hasn't gone unnoticed among Sunnis."
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-air-india-privatisation-analysis-idUSKBN19U02T,AIR INDIA BREAK-UP AN OPTION AS MODI PUSHES FOR QUICK SALE,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is considering selling state-owned Air India in parts to make it attractive to potential buyers, as it reviews options to divest the loss-making flagship carrier, several government officials familiar with the situation said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet gave the go-ahead last month for the government to try to sell the airline, after successive governments spent billions of dollars in recent years to keep the airline going. Air India - founded in the 1930s and known to generations of Indians for its Maharajah mascot - is saddled with a debt burden of $8.5 billion and a bloated cost structure. The government has injected $3.6 billion since 2012 to bail out the airline. Once the nation's largest carrier, its market share in the booming domestic market has slumped to 13 percent as private carriers such as InterGlobe Aviation's (INGL.NS) IndiGo and Jet Airways (JET.NS) have grown. Previous attempts to offload the airline have been unsuccessful. If Modi can pull this off, it will buttress his credentials as a reformer brave enough to wade into some of the country's most intractable problems. His office has set a deadline of early next year to get the sale process underway, the officials said, declining to be named as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the plans. The timeline is ambitious and the process fraught, with opinion divided on the best way forward: should the government retain a stake or exit completely, and should it risk being left with the unprofitable pieces while buyers pick off the better businesses, officials said. Already, a labour union that represents 2,500 of the airline's 40,000 employees has opposed the idea of a sale even though it is ideologically aligned to Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party. Officials who have to make it happen are grappling with the sheer scale of the exercise. Air India has six subsidiaries  three of which are loss-making  with assets worth about $4.6 billion. It has an estimated $1.24 billion worth of real estate, including two hotels, where ownership is split among various government entities. No one has properly valued the company's various businesses and assets before, two officials with direct knowledge of the process said. Earlier this month, about $30 million worth of art, including paintings by artist M. F. Husain, went missing from its Mumbai offices, chairman Ashwani Lohani said. ""The exercise is complex and there is no easy way out,"" said Jitendra Bhargava, operational head of Air India in 1997-2010. ""At this juncture, selling even part of Air India is far from certain."" Lohani declined to comment on the sale process. The prime minister's office and the civil aviation ministry also declined to comment. A committee of five senior federal ministers, led by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, is expected to meet this month and begin ironing out the finer details of the plan. Besides deciding about the size of the stake sale, the panel will set the bidding norms. It will also take a call on the carrier's debt, demerger and divestment of its three profit-making subsidiaries. Modi's office has said the government has no business being in hospitality and travel, suggesting the prime minister wants to sell as much of Air India as possible, the officials said. Analysts say the government may prefer to keep the airline in Indian hands. At least two potential Indian suitors  the Tata Sons conglomerate and IndiGo - have shown early interest. In recent weeks, officials in Modi's office and from the civil aviation ministry met Ratan Tata, the patriarch of the $100 billion-a-year Tata Sons, to gauge the companys interest in a deal, a close aide to Modi said. Tata would be an attractive buyer for the government. The company founded and operated Air India before it was nationalised in 1953. ""Seems like Tata will come forward and make the best offer,"" the aide said, adding the government would be keen to see that jobs are not lost. Tata, however, already has two other airline joint ventures in India, and it's not clear what parts of Air India it would be interested in. A Tata spokeswoman declined to comment. IndiGo said on Thursday it was interested in the international operations and in Air India Express, a low-cost carrier. Modi's office has told officials to work out exactly how much each of Air India's subsidiaries are worth to make it easier to break up the carrier if needed, two of the officials said. The government is expected to appoint outside consultants to help with the exercise. Anshuman Deb, aviation analyst at ICICI Securities, said splitting the airline will maximize value for the government. ""Let us be realistic. It's very clear that a single buyer cannot buy an entire state-owned company,"" said a senior aviation ministry official involved in the process.

http://cnn.com/2017/07/10/health/alabama-vibriosis-bacteria-coastal-waters/index.html,ALABAMA HEALTH OFFICIALS WARN OF INFECTIOUS BACTERIA IN COASTAL WATERS,"(CNN) Four cases of people have been infected with the illness-causing bacteria Vibrio vulnificus, according to health officials in Mobile County, Alabama.

One case happened in March of this year when someone went out of the state, ate raw oysters, and became infected with Vibrio, said J. Mark Bryant, the public information officer for the Mobile County Health Department.

Another case occurred in April after a local resident consumed raw oysters in Mobile County.

""Then in June, we had two people that went into the waters south of Mobile County, and also were infected,"" Bryant said.

Infection with any form of these Vibrio bacteria causes vibriosis, the symptoms of which include watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills. If Vibrio infects an open wound, it can cause pain, redness and swelling. Skin rashes have also been reported.

Most people contract the infection by consuming raw oysters and other shellfish harboring the bacteria, or when open wounds are exposed to brackish or salt water where the bacteria is present.

Symptoms can be especially severe in people with weakened immune systems, and those who have cancer, diabetes, liver disease or other chronic conditions.

Bryant said all four cases in Mobile County were mild because they were identified and treated early.

A fifth case was reported recently in a Mississippi woman who contracted the infection while fishing on a pier in Baldwin County, Alabama.

Dr. Karen Landers, assistant state health officer for the Alabama Department of Public Health, said that despite the infection occurring in Alabama, it is being investigated by the Mississippi State Department of Health.

In an email to CNN, Dr. Paul Byers, Mississippi state epidemiologist, said, ""the Mississippi State Department of Health does not provide specific details regarding individual cases to protect personal information and to avoid patient identification.""

But Byers confirmed that the Mississippi State Department of Health did recently receive notice of a new Vibrio case, bringing the total number of cases reported in Mississippi in 2017 to nine.

Landers said the most important thing people can do to avoid Vibrio infections is to be ""wound and water aware,"" especially during the summer months when the amount of Vibrio bacteria in the water is at a higher concentration.

""The overarching message is that we must have a specific awareness for our own health and our own safety,"" said Landers.

""Let's say you sustain a wound in the water. You need to watch for signs and symptoms of illness,"" she said.

Landers asks that anyone showing signs of infection, such as redness or swelling, wash the wound and then immediately go and see their healthcare provider.

Tesla board member Ira Ehrenpreis was the first to put down a $1,000 deposit on the Model 3 and gifted the car to Musk for his 46th birthday, Musk said in a tweet. (bit.ly/2v3RyDX) Musk has high hopes for the $35,000 Model 3, aimed at the mass market, and expects the rollout to help the company deliver five times its current annual sales volume. Tesla's shares have taken a beating in the last few weeks, as investors have become increasingly concerned that demand for the company's existing Model S sedan is weakening. Musk said in May that some ""confused"" Tesla buyers considered the new Model 3 as an upgrade to the Model S, hurting orders for the older car. Registrations for Tesla's vehicles in California, its largest market, fell 24 percent in April from a year ago, according to data from research firm IHS Markit. Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that new registrations of Tesla cars fell to zero in Hong Kong after authorities slashed a tax break for electric vehicles in April.  Last week, Musk said production of the Model 3 would increase exponentially  from 100 cars in August, more than 1,500 in September to 20,000 Model 3 cars per month in December.

Trump said on Twitter early on Sunday that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed on Friday forming ""an impenetrable Cyber Security unit"" to address issues like the risk of cyber meddling in elections. The idea appeared to be a political non-starter. It was immediately scorned by several of Trump's fellow Republicans, who questioned why the United States would work with Russia after Moscow's alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. ""It's not the dumbest idea I have ever heard but it's pretty close,"" Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" program.  Ash Carter, who was U.S. defense secretary until the end of former Democratic President Barack Obama's administration in January, told CNN flatly: ""This is like the guy who robbed your house proposing a working group on burglary."" Trump's advisers, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, had recently sought to explain Trump's cyber push. Mnuchin said on Saturday that Trump and Putin had agreed to create ""a cyber unit to make sure that there was absolutely no interference whatsoever, that they would work on cyber security together."" But Trump returned to Twitter on Sunday to play down the idea, which arose at his talks with Putin at a summit of the Group of 20 nations in Hamburg, Germany.  ""The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit doesn't mean I think it can happen. It can't,""  Trump said on Twitter.  He then noted that an agreement with Russia for a ceasefire in Syria ""can & did"" happen. Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona acknowledged Trump's desire to move forward with Russia, but added: ""There has to be a price to pay."" ""There has been no penalty,"" McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" program according to a CBS transcript. ""Vladimir Putin ... got away with literally trying to change the outcome ... of our election."" Trump argued for a rapprochement with Moscow in his campaign but has been unable to deliver because his administration has been dogged by investigations into the allegations of Russian interference in the election and ties with his campaign. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the matter, including whether there may have been any collusion on the part of Trump campaign officials, as are congressional committees including both the House of Representatives and Senate intelligence panels. Those probes are focused almost exclusively on Moscows actions, lawmakers and intelligence officials say, and no evidence has surfaced publicly implicating other countries despite Trump's suggestion that others could have been involved. Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump says his campaign did not collude with Russia. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" program that Russia could not be a credible partner in a cyber security unit. ""If thats our best election defense, we might as well just mail our ballot boxes to Moscow,"" Schiff added. Separately, U.S. government officials said a recent hack into business systems of U.S. nuclear power and other energy companies was carried out by Russian government hackers, the Washington Post reported on Saturday. Trump said he ""strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election. He vehemently denied it."" He added: ""We negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives. Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!"" In Trump's first attempt at ending the six-year Syrian civil war, the United States, Russia and Jordan on Friday reached a ceasefire and ""de-escalation agreement"" for southwestern Syria. The ceasefire was holding hours after it took effect on Sunday, a monitor and two rebel officials said.     Any joint U.S.-Russia cyber initiative would have been a different matter. Depending how much it veered into military or espionage operations, it could have faced major legal hurdles. Language in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act prohibits the Pentagon, which includes the National Security Agency and the U.S. military's Cyber Command, from using any funds for bilateral military cooperation with Russia. Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, also noted restrictions on sharing information with Russia that would clearly prohibit offering Moscow a sense of U.S. cyber capabilities. Russia would be similarly adverse to revealing its capabilities to the United States, he noted. ""It just will not happen,"" McFaul told Reuters.

Trump campaigned in last year's presidential election on cracking down on China for its trade practices, but he softened his rhetoric after taking office, saying he wanted to work with China on the nuclear issue. When the two leaders first met in April at Trump's Florida resort, they appeared to hit it off. Trump called Xi a ""good man"" as he urged him to use Beijing's economic clout to force North Korea to curb its nuclear weapons program. Lately, Trump has expressed some impatience on China's role in North Korea - particularly after Pyongyang launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that some experts believe could have the range to reach Alaska, and parts of the U.S. West Coast. His administration made new arms sales to Taiwan, imposed sanctions on two Chinese citizens and a shipping company and put China on a global human trafficking list. It also accused a Chinese bank of laundering money for Pyongyang. The White House is also debating trade actions against Beijing, including tariffs on its steel exports and a few days before the G20 talks, Trump complained that trade between China and North Korea had grown.  But he showed none of that impatience on Saturday, when the leaders met at the invitation of Xi at the tail end of the G20 in Germany. ""It's an honor to have you as a friend,"" Trump told Xi, telling him he appreciated actions he had already taken on North Korea. ""As far as North Korea is concerned, we will have, eventually, success. It may take longer than I'd like. It may take longer than you'd like. But there will be success in the end one way or the other,"" Trump said. Speaking to reporters later on Air Force One, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the Trump-Xi meeting lasted over an hour-and-a-half, and they had ""substantive discussions"" about how to deal with North Korea together. ""In regards to China, we had very direct discussions about North Korea. We had very direct discussions about military and security cooperation,"" Mnuchin said.   ""I think that President Trump made very clear to President Xi that he is focused on this issue, and wants to move forward and make progress. And I think President Xi gave a very interesting perspective from their standpoint,"" he added.    For his part, Xi told Trump that stronger China-U.S. ties were conducive to stability and prosperity amid global conflicts, and had made ""new progress"" in some areas ""despite some sensitive issues"", Xi said, according to state news agency Xinhua. Xi stressed the importance of talks with North Korea, and said China's navy will join next year's U.S.-led Pacific Rim military exercises. Xinhua said Xi stressed to Trump China's position that it adheres to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and maintaining peace and stability there. While China has been angered by North Korea's repeated nuclear and missile tests, it also blames the United States and South Korea for worsening tension with their military exercises. ""China has many times talked about its principled position, namely that at the same time as the international community making necessary responses to North Korean acts that go against U.N. Security Council resolutions, they must step up efforts to promote talks and manage and control the situation,"" Xinhua said, citing Xi. Xi also reiterated China's opposition to the U.S. deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system in South Korea, Xinhua said. China says THAAD threatens its security, despite U.S. and South Korean assurances it is aimed only at defending against North Korea. Both leaders agreed to maintain close communication and coordination on the Korean peninsula nuclear issue, Xinhua said. In a statement released on Sunday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Xi and Trump had ""enhanced mutual understanding"" about the North Korea issue and ""confirmed the broad direction of using peaceful means to resolve this issue"". Trump also mentioned trade imbalances in his meeting with Xi, calling it a ""very, very big issue"" that he would address. ""I know that China in particular, which is a great trading partner, we will be able to do something that will be equitable and reciprocal,"" Trump said. Senior officials from both countries will meet in Washington on July 19 to discuss economic and trade issues.

http://cnn.com/2017/07/10/europe/brexit-eu-nationals/index.html,EU PARLIAMENT MAY VETO 'DAMP SQUIB' UK OFFER TO EU NATIONALS,"London (CNN) British Prime Minister Theresa May has again come under fire, with the European Parliament warning it may veto her proposals on EU nations living in the UK because they risk creating a ""second class of citizenship.""

May has been criticized on a regular basis since making public her plans to extend rights to the 3.2 million EU nationals living in Britain after Brexit.

The proposals put forward by May were described as a ""damp squib"" in a letter written by EU Parliament chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt and leaders of the parliament's four main parties, and published Monday.

""The proposal falls short of its own ambitions to 'put citizens first'. If implemented, it would cast a dark cloud of vagueness and uncertainty over the lives of millions of Europeans,"" the letter read.

According to the British government's plans, a new ""settled status"" would allow EU nationals who have lived in the UK for five years to remain and enjoy access to health care, education and other benefits.

EU nationals who have spent a shorter time in the UK would be allowed to remain until they reach the five-year point, at which stage they can apply for settled status. Others who arrive after an as-yet-undisclosed cut-off date will benefit from a ""grace period,"" expected to last two years.

May has promised families will not be split up, but her government says that all EU citizens and their families must obtain an immigration status irrespective of when they arrived in the country.

The proposal is dependent on British nationals living in EU states being offered a reciprocal deal.

But Verhofstadt and his fellow European politicians says the proposal falls short of the promises made by the Vote Leave campaign, which said it would treat EU citizens ""no less favorably than at present"" once Britain withdraws from the EU.

""The British government proposes that -- the day after Brexit -- Europeans obtain the status of 'third country nationals',"" the letter read.

""These nationals would get fewer rights in the UK than British citizens are offered throughout the EU. Europeans will not only lose their right to vote in local elections, their future family members will also be subject to minimum income requirements, and it is unclear what the status of 'post-Brexit' babies will be.

""The British proposal carries a real risk of creating a second class of citizenship.""

The European Parliament will have a vote on the final Brexit deal, which will include the rights of EU nationals and British citizens living in EU states.

While it does not engage in direct talks with London, it will press Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, to secure a better deal before Britain leaves the bloc in March 2019.

The letter also insists that the European Court of Justice plays a full role in enforcing the rights of both British and EU nationals -- a demand which the UK government will see as infringing upon a red line. May has said the rights of EU citizens should be enforced by UK courts.

""We will never endorse the retroactive removal of acquired rights,"" the letter added.

""The European Parliament will reserve its right to reject any agreement that treats EU citizens, regardless of their nationality, less favorably than they are at present. For us, this is a question of basic fundamental rights and values, which are at the heart of the European project.""

'Basic rights' will be protected, UK says

In response, Damian Green, Britain's first secretary of state, insisted the ""basic rights"" of EU citizens will be protected by the government's proposals.

Speaking to the BBC, Green said, ""... somebody who is here now will keep the rights that they already have and we hope and expect that British citizens living in other EU countries will keep the rights that they already have there.""

He added: ""If we're outside the European Union, then we clearly have to have basic immigration rules to check that somebody coming is from the country they say they are coming from and is a citizen of that country, all that kind of thing.

""But that's not an insuperable barrier. We all fill in forms when we go on holiday and have to get visas and things like that in other parts of the world. But the basic rights will be preserved, so that should not be an obstacle to a final deal."""
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-g-20-germany-putin-trump-cyber-idUSKBN19V0XU?il=0,RUSSIA CONFIRMS PUTIN-TRUMP TALK ON JOINT CYBER UNIT,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia confirmed on Monday that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had discussed forming a joint Russian-U.S. group on cyber security, an idea that has provoked uproar in Washington, but said it was only a tentative proposal.  Trump said on Twitter early on Sunday the two leaders discussed forming ""an impenetrable Cyber Security unit"" when they met at the Hamburg G20 summit.  The idea was greeted with incredulity by some senior  Republicans who said Moscow could not be trusted - and the U.S. president later in the day tweeted that he did not think it could happen. ""The heads of state did talk about such a possibility,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters on Monday. ""Nothing was promised to each other,"" he added. ""What is positive, they stated their readiness to work in this direction."" The conversation had been ""about the possibility of forming such a group"", he said. ""Whether it will be created or not, time will show."" Svetlana Lukash, a Russian official who was at the Hamburg summit, told a news conference earlier on Monday Putin and Trump's discussion of cyber security had taken up 40 minutes of their meeting, which lasted more than two hours.    ""President Putin proposed creating a working group,"" she said. ""This does not mean it should start working immediately, virtually tomorrow."" She added: ""The main thing is, this matter was discussed, the United States is ready to consider cooperation in this sphere, and then we will see. Maybe this will be a working group, maybe this will be cooperation on the floor of the United Nations. But in any case, our two countries will need to discuss these questions. This is namely what the presidents agreed upon. She said of the landmark talks between the two men in Hamburg: ""Nobody, except the participants of that meeting, knows how that proposal was formulated and how President Trump reacted.""  Some media reports may have prematurely assumed that the creation of a joint commission on cyber security was already decided, she said. ""That was a proposal. Probably, he (Trump) is not ready yet for this specific initiative at this stage,"" Lukash said. Trump's administration has been dogged by investigations into allegations of Russian interference in last year's U.S. election and ties with his campaign. Peskov also told reporters on Monday the Kremlin did not know the identity of the Russian lawyer who allegedly met Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., Trump's election campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, last year. The New York Times said on Sunday that Trump's associates met with the Kremlin-linked lawyer after being promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton. The newspaper identified the lawyer as Natalia Veselnitskaya. It said the meeting had taken place in Trump Tower on June 9, 2016, two weeks after Trump won the Republican nomination. ""No, we don't know who it is and, certainly, we cannot track down all movements of all Russian lawyers both within Russia and abroad,"" Peskov said. Editing by Christian Lowe and Andrew Roche"
http://cnn.com/travel/article/ljubljana-slovenia-restaurants-ana-ro/index.html,"LJUBLJANA, SLOVENIA, RESTAURANTS: CHEF ANA ANA ROÃÂ  PICKS THE BEST - CNN.COM","Kate Springer, CNN Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Published 6th July 2017

(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Chef Ana RoÃÂ¡ has single-handedly elevated Slovenian gastronomy to the world stage, having spent the past 15 years cultivating a culinary treasure inside her family's humble inn and restaurant HiÃÂ¡a Franko

Hidden away in Kobarid, a tiny town in Slovenia's northwest Soca River Valley, the cozy, family-run restaurant has drawn visitors from all over the world -- not to mention attention from the global culinary community. Most notably, RoÃÂ¡ was named World's Best Female Chef 2017 by the World's 50 Best Restaurants awards

It might have something to do with her contemporary approach to Slovenian food.

Slovenian chef Ana Ros was named World's Best Female Chef 2017 by World's 50 Best Restaurants.

Unfamiliar with the country's cuisine?

Sandwiched between Italy to the west and Austria to the north, the Central European country tends to see a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean flavors -- think fresh cottage cheeses, rich olive oil, fresh bread, potatoes, trout, pasta and mutton.

""Slovenia is a melting pot of cultures, history and traditions,"" RoÃÂ¡ tells CNN. ""Within 30 miles, you experience high mountains and beautiful beaches. This is exactly what our food looks like, but it's very personal. I try to tell my story, and express how I am evolving, in each dish.""

While HiÃÂ¡a Franko tends to sweep up the awards, RoÃÂ¡ and her partner, sommelier Valter Kramar, also co-own a restaurant in the Slovenian capital of Ljubljana: Gostilna na Gradu. As a frequent visitor to the storybook-worthy city, she tells CNN about her favorite haunts for intimate dinners, bar bites, cool bistros and unforgettable dining experiences:

JB Restaurant

For a modern dinner with a side of old-world charm, RoÃÂ¡ points to JB Restaurant.

""Every country has 'The Chef.' In Slovenia, this is him. Chef Janez BratovÃÂ¾ is the father of modern Slovenian cuisine,"" says RoÃÂ¡. ""He was the first to manage to enter the San Pellegrino list a few years ago (in 2010) and be ranked among the top 100 restaurants in the world. I like his more classical interpretations because they show off very well the skills of the chef.""

Designed by famous Slovenian architect JoÃÂ¾e PleÃÂnik, the family-run restaurant sports stylish interiors within a 1920s-heritage building. The cuisine takes its cues from the Mediterranean, with a heavy emphasis on fresh fish, game dishes, Ljubljana cottage cheese -- not to mention a long Slovenian wine list.

JB Restaurant , Janez BratovÃÂ¾ s.p., MikloÃÂ¡iÃÂeva 19, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; +386 1 430 70 70

Strelec Restaurant

Restaurant Strelec is built in a tower of Ljubljana Castle and offers an outside terrace with views over the city and countryside.

For a regal dining experience, this is the place. A circular room, Strelec Restaurant is built into the Ljubljana Castle archer tower and provides 360-degree views of the city. While the decor seems to embrace a medieval theme, it's not kitschy -- picture fur throws, stone walls, wall tapestries and a spiral staircase.

The avant-garde dishes are unconventional as well, designed in collaboration with an ethnologist to trace Slovenia's history.

Chef Igor Jagodic brings Slovenian history to life in his ever-changing tasting menus, which usually (but not always) feature signatures, such as potato with yolk and truffles, frog legs, or Danube salmon with Jerusalem artichokes.

""The menu always changes,"" says RoÃÂ¡. ""One of the most ambitious and skilled Slovenian chefs, the chef is shy in his private life, but very ambitious when it comes to his work.""

Strelec Restaurant , Grajska planota 1, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; +386 31 687 648

Gostilna na Gradu

When exploring the leafy grounds of Ljubljana Castle, atop a hill overlooking the city, it's impossible to pass by Gostilna na Gradu. With its alfresco deck and cavern-like interiors, the restaurant looks like the perfect place to sip on crisp Slovenian wine and while away an afternoon.

""This is our restaurant in the capital,"" says RoÃÂ¡. ""My husband, Valter Kramar, and I opened the place in partnership with chef Svetozar Raspopovic-Pope, wanting to create a restaurant where you can taste all of Slovenia in one spot.

""We delegated chef Damjan Fink to helm the kitchen. He used to work for me for some years. One day, he'll take over the place.""

On the menu? Fresh and aged Tolmin cheese, Kranjska Gora sausage (from a northwestern Alpine region), comforting nettle-filled ravioli, beef tongue with parsnip and a traditional barley stew.

Gostilna na Gradu , Grajska planota 1, 1000 Ljubljana; +386 8 205 19 30

Monstera Bistro

A casual-cool new bistro on a pretty pedestrian street, Monstera Bistro is helmed by Bine VolÃÂiÃÂ, a Le Cordon Bleu-trained chef. The small dining area feels clean yet industrial -- all white and gray, with exposed piping, concrete and bricks. An open kitchen provides a look at how the sausage is made -- sometimes literally -- and the coffee and wine bar makes it easy to enjoy a quick one.

""It's one of the newest arrivals in the city (opened in 2016). It's young, fresh and reminds me of my favorite Paris bistro, Clamato,"" says RoÃÂ¡. ""The black pudding with langoustines is simply perfect.""

The ever-changing set menus follow the seasons, using local ingredients as a rule. While the food might change, biodynamic Slovenian wines and home-brewed Lila MiSa craft beer are always close at hand.

Gostilna SkaruÃÂna

Gostilna SkaruÃÂna is an energetic, Bohemian place outside Ljubljana.

About 15 minutes into the countryside outside the capital, Gostilna SkaruÃÂna has a reputation for its boisterous dinners and eclectic surrounds.

""This is one of the craziest places on Earth that you can imagine,"" says RoÃÂ¡. ""It is a 'one and only' kind of experience. It's run by a crazy father and a crazier son. They have great traditional food, a fantastic organic wine list, and unconventional music.""

What's so crazy about it? It comes down to the gregarious owner, Slavko ÃÂ½agar Jr.

ÃÂ½agar inherited the restaurant from his mustachioed father about 15 years ago, and still drives the same beat-up Yugoslavian car around the Slovenian countryside to collect his meat and produce -- everything from cottage cheese to pumpkin oil, trout and beef tongue. The eclectic Bohemian decor adds to the anything-goes energy, with vintage typewriters, vinyl records and memorabilia cluttering every inch of the antique furniture.

""You can spend hours at the table here, and then it really starts when the cviÃÂek (a light red wine from the southwestern Slovenia) and spirits come out.""

Gostilna SkaruÃÂna , SkaruÃÂna 20, 1217 Vodice, Slovenia; +386 1 832 30 80

Sushimama

Japanese food might not be your top pick when dining out in Slovenia, but it's hard to argue with the menu at Sushimama. In addition to the obvious sushi and sashimi, there's Kobe-style wagyu beef carpaccio, scorpion fish nigiri, shrimp tempura, miso crab soup, Alaskan black cod... see what we mean?

""This is the best sushi in town,"" says RoÃÂ¡. ""The decor is clean and contemporary, and they're in love with good ingredients. The atmosphere is really peaceful and quiet ... until my family enters. My son seemingly holds the restaurant record for the highest number of sushi eaten in one evening.""

Sushimama , Wolfova ulica 12, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; +386 40 702 070

Stelec chef Igor Jagodic's signature dishes include potato with yolk and truffles, frog legs, or Danube salmon with Jerusalem artichokes.

Pop's Place

There's really never a night that Pop's Place isn't popping. The enormous pub has several outdoor seating areas -- one in a cobblestone courtyard, the other by the river -- and ample space inside as well.

The specialty here? Burgers and craft beer. Run by a Slovenian who grew up in the United States, the gastropub draws a crowd day and night.

The burgers are made with locally sourced beef which has been blended and aged in house. But if beef isn't your thing, the chicken sandwiches, BBQ ribs and sweet potato fries also come highly recommended.

""I often go here and dine alone, but I never feel alone. It has such a great young, loud atmosphere,"" says RoÃÂ¡. ""The place invites people to relax and leave all their concerns at the door."""
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-10/men-and-republicans-are-the-best-tippers,Missing,"Hoping to get a good tip? Seek out the table with the most conservative men from New England. A new survey finds men, Republicans, and residents of the northeast are the best tippers.Women tip a median of 16 percent, while Democrats and southerners leave a median 15 percent at a restaurant, according to a new survey of more than 1,000 American adults conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates International on behalf of CreditCards.com. That's compared with the median 20 percent that men, Republicans, and northeasterners leave. Those who pay with plastic leave a median 20 percent, compared with 15 percent for those who pay in cash. Though roughly half of people tip between 16 percent and 20 percent, about a fifth of restaurant goers polled admitted to stiffing the wait staff at least occasionally. I was definitely surprised by how many people tip over 15 percent, but I was also surprised by how many people never tip at all at a restaurant, Matt Schulz, CreditCards.coms senior industry analyst, said in a statement. Im guessing they don't get very good service on their next visit.Tipping isn't customary worldwide, but it's a critical source of income for nearly all American service workers. The federal minimum wage for tipped employees is just $2.13. Such workers rely on the collective whim of their customers for the remainder of their earnings.  (A handful of states have a higher minimum wage for such employees, including Alaska, California, and Oregon.)There's a discriminatory nature to tipping, advocates of alternative payment options argue. ""The typical full-time, year-round female server is paid just 68 percent of what her male counterpart is paid ($17,000 vs. $25,000 annually),"" a February 2012 report from the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United found. ""The gender pay gap is even larger for women of color. Black female servers, for example, are paid only 60 percent of what all male servers are paid.""The report found that, among more complex gender and economic reasons, these servers were paid less because women, particularly women of color, more frequently worked at fast-food and family-style establishments, rather than in fine dining, where tips are higher.There's been a recent trend against tipping, with some restaurants factoring the service charge into the cost of their products. Famed restaurateur Danny Meyer nixed tipping at his restaurants entirely. The majority of restaurants, however, still have tipping policies. Issues with tipping extend beyond the restaurant industry. The survey found that 31 percent of those surveyed never tip their housekeeper when staying at a hotel and 30 percent never tip their barista at a coffee shop. Hair stylists and barbers fared slightly better: Only 12 percent of those polled stiffed these workers. Women were more likely than men to tip in all three of these scenarios. The bottom line? Tip your service workers. "

http://cnn.com/2017/07/09/us/lawsuit-black-lives-matter-baton-rouge/index.html,BATON ROUGE OFFICER SUES BLACK LIVES MATTER OVER 2016 AMBUSH OF COPS,"(CNN) A wounded officer's lawsuit filed in federal court in Louisiana alleges Black Lives Matter and several of its leaders are responsible for last year's ambush on law enforcement in Baton Rouge.

The July 17, 2016, attack by gunman Gavin Long claimed the lives of two police officers and a sheriff's deputy and wounded two deputies and an officer.

Lawyers for one of the wounded law enforcement officers filed the complaint Friday in US District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana against various arms of the Black Lives Matter movement and leaders including DeRay Mckesson and Johnetta Elzie.

The complaint alleges Black Lives Matter and its leaders are responsible for the shooting because they ""incited the violence against police in retaliation for the death (sic) of black men shot by police,"" and ""did nothing to dissuade the ongoing violence and injury to police.""

""In fact, they justified the violence as necessary to the movement and war,"" the complaint says.

The person who filed the lawsuit is named in the complaint only as Officer John Doe Smith. It says he is 42 with two children and is permanently disabled as a result of the numerous injuries he suffered in the ambush.

Smith, the complaint says, was shot through his abdomen, left shoulder and left side of his head. The shot to his abdomen ""tore up his intestines,"" requiring 16 surgeries and causing recurring infections. Medical staff must attend to the exit wound daily, it says.

The shot to Smith's head almost tore off his left ear, which needed to be sewn back on, the complaint says. His skull was shattered and he lost brain matter on the left side, in an area controlling communication. His left eye stays mostly closed with the eyeball turned outward, it says.

""John Doe Police Officer was strong and vibrant and he has been struggling everyday, fighting to live, and fighting to get better,"" the complaint says. It seeks at least $75,000 in compensatory damages.

It is not clear why the officer filed the complaint under a pseudonym.

Donna Grodner, the attorney for the officer who filed the suit, told CNN she wasn't authorized to speak about the case.

The Baton Rouge victims

In the attack last July , Long waited for police near a Baton Rouge convenience store that was known as a favorite stop for patrol officers.

Armed with a rifle, he fatally shot Officers Matthew Gerald, 41, and Montrell Jackson, 32, outside the store as soon as he saw them.

Sheriff's Deputy Brad Garafola, who apparently was responding to reports of a man with a rifle, heard the shots and took cover, but then ran to help one of the downed officers. That's when Long opened fire, killing Garafola.

Long then shot Officer Chad Montgomery, who had pulled up in front of the building. The bullet grazed his head.

In a nearby parking lot, Sheriff's Deputy Nicholas Tullier, then 41, was in his cruiser to run the tag on Long's car when the gunman emerged from the woods and opened fire, shooting as he walked toward the vehicle.

Tullier was shot once in the head and twice in the abdomen and was in a coma for months.

Long took shots at another arriving deputy, Bruce Simmons, 51, shattering the bone from his elbow to his shoulder. Simmons now has a titanium rod in his arm.

SWAT officers then arrived on scene and shot Long in the leg, causing him to fall to the ground. As Long reached for his weapon, five SWAT officers fired, killing him.

Lawsuit: Black Lives Matter 'declared war' on police

The complaint describes in detail numerous protests that erupted across the country over several years, spurred by the shooting deaths of black men at the hands of police, and lists instances of violence, looting and vandalism at protests in Ferguson, Missouri; Baltimore; McKinney, Texas; Dallas and Baton Rouge.

The suit notes Mckesson's involvement in Black Lives Matter, and it points to his participation in the protests and his appearances in the media when he was introduced as a leader of the movement or a protest organizer.

When violence erupted at some of the protests, the complaint says, Mckesson and other Black Lives Matter leaders ""failed to disavow the violence and urged its followers that violence was part of revolution,"" the complaint says.

""By embracing and supporting violence in protest that could have been conducted peacefully, BLM declared a virtual war on police,"" it says.

When reached for comment, Mckesson told CNN, ""This is the second lawsuit an officer has filed against me from Baton Rouge. ... I'm confident it has no merit.""

Elzie had no comment, and other defendants from Black Lives Matter could not be immediately reached for comment.

Baton Rouge ambush 'mimicked' Dallas attack

Mckesson and Elzie were present for protests in Baton Rouge in July 2016 held in response to the officer-involved shooting deaths of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile near Minneapolis earlier that month.

The suit says they came to protest and ""to incite others to violence against police and other law enforcement officers.""

Mckesson was arrested during the protests on July 9, though he told CNN days later the arrest was unlawful because he was complying with police requests to move back at the time.

The lawsuit also says Long's actions when he killed the Baton Rouge officers ""followed and mimicked those of another BLM activist who killed several officers in Dallas just days earlier.""

Five Dallas police officers were killed and seven others wounded on July 7 last year when a gunman opened fire on them during protests against the killings of Sterling and Castile.

Investigators identified the Dallas gunman as Micah Xavier Johnson, 25, a military veteran who had served in Afghanistan.

Johnson told police negotiators during a standoff that he was upset about recent police shootings and wanted to kill white people, especially white officers, the police chief said. His online history showed he visited and liked several websites dedicated to Black Lives Matter. Johnson was killed after a standoff with police.

Long, who acted alone in the shooting, traveled to Baton Rouge after stopping in Dallas shortly after the shooting to get revenge for the recent killings, the complaint says, suggesting that Black Lives Matter encouraged the behavior."
http://cnn.com/2017/07/10/politics/trump-putin-meeting-conflicting-reports/index.html,WHAT DID TRUMP AND PUTIN DISCUSS? DEPENDS ON WHO YOU ASK -- AND WHEN,"(CNN) For all the hype, it wasn't until after President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin were done talking, more than two hours after their G20 mini-summit began, that the real drama kicked off.

The ensuing confusion and controversy underscored the tricky nature of such high-wire acts of international diplomacy. Whatever the two leaders discussed in Hamburg, the reality was always that the interpretations they took home -- and those they broadcast to a public thirsty for details -- would be equally important.

Trump and Putin entered the meeting with Russia's meddling in the 2016 US presidential campaign hanging over their heads. Putin, of course, has been accused of ordering it; members of Trump's inner circle are at the center of a probe into whether they colluded with the Kremlin.

Settling on meddling

A day before their sit-down, Trump at a news conference in Poland further muddied the waters, suggesting other countries -- with or instead of Russia -- might have been responsible for the interference. ""Nobody really knows,"" he said.

There was a question as to whether he would raise the matter with Putin at all.

Trump did, ultimately, confront Putin. How he did it and whether he ""strongly pressed"" the issue -- or simply took Putin's denial at face value and moved on -- is more difficult to discern. In the 72 hours since they parted ways, both sides have offered their own, Rashomon-like accounts of the interaction.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov began a minor row early on when he said that Trump was on board with Putin's account.

""President Trump said he's heard Putin's very clear statements that this is not true and that the Russian government didn't interfere in the elections and that he accepts these statements,"" Lavrov told reporters, according to a CNN translation. ""That's all.""

But no -- there would be more. A senior Trump administration official denied that characterization and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who briefed the press separately, suggested a less cut-and-dry resolution.

""(Trump and Putin) had a very robust and lengthy exchange on the subject,"" Tillerson said, speaking vaguely about what was discussed, except to note Putin's denial. He suggested later on that the issue had been effectively sidelined, with ""the Presidents rightly focused on how do we move forward from what may be simply an intractable disagreement at this point.""

White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, asked about it during a Fox News interview on Sunday, was more direct.

Trump ""absolutely did not believe"" Putin, he said, and never, as Lavrov claimed, told his Russian counterpart that ""certain circles"" in the US were exaggerating evidence.

Sanctioned statements?

Still, the most dizzying questions to pop up in the wake of the meeting have pitted Trump against himself and, on Monday, White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

""Sanctions were not discussed at my meeting with President Putin,"" Trump tweeted early Sunday. ""Nothing will be done until the Ukrainian & Syrian problems are solved!""

Sanctions were not discussed at my meeting with President Putin. Nothing will be done until the Ukrainian & Syrian problems are solved! Ã¢ÂÂ Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 9, 2017

But by the time Sanders spoke the next day, the story had changed. During an afternoon briefing, she said that Trump and Putin did, in fact, broach the subject.

""There were sanctions specific to election meddling that I believe were discussed,"" Sanders told reporters, ""but not beyond that.""

Tillerson had hinted at something similar during his initial review.

""With regard to the interference in the election, I think the President took note of actions that have been discussed by the Congress,"" he said, appearing to reference the round now brewing on Capitol Hill. ""Most recently, additional sanctions that have been voted out of the Senate to make it clear as to the seriousness of the issue.""

Cybersecurity squad goes boom ... then bust

No one denies that there was discussion of a joint cybersecurity venture between the US and Russia. The only question seems to be why.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/08/us/chicago-high-school-graduation-requirement/index.html,"CHICAGO'S NEW REQUIREMENT FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS: NO PLAN, NO DIPLOMA","(CNN) A product of Chicago's South Side, DeAvion Gillarm will be the first in his family to attend college.

""I always had a plan,"" said Gillarm, a Morgan Park High School graduate headed to Lincoln College next month. ""You're not going to be successful without a plan.""

Under a controversial new requirement, starting in 2020, students hoping to graduate from a public high school in Chicago must provide evidence they, too, have a plan for the future: either acceptance to college or a gap-year program, a trade apprenticeship, military enlistment or a job offer.

""It will help students think about what they want to do next in life,"" said Gillarm, who wants to study exercise science in college.

But not everyone is sold on a plan that Mayor Rahm Emanuel said will steer every graduating senior in the nation's third-largest school system on ""a path toward a successful life.""

Chicago Republican Party chairman Chris Cleveland, the parent of a public school student, said the Democratic mayor should instead focus on reducing a public high school dropout rate of nearly 30%. He questioned how the cash-strapped school system will pay for additional guidance counselors to help students develop post-secondary plans.

""How can they deny a high school kid a diploma he or she has earned?"" Cleveland asked. ""It's all well and good that they're asking kids to think about their futures, but denying a kid a diploma because they didn't get into college or get a job is absurd.""

'A pre-K to college model'

The Chicago Board of Education approved the plan, known as "" Learn. Plan. Succeed ,"" in May. With 381,000 students, Chicago Public Schools would become the first large urban district to implement such a requirement, according to city officials.

Public high school graduation requirements currently include science courses and 40 hours of community service.

""Yes, it is a requirement, but we're going to support you to also ensure you have a post-high school educational plan,"" Emanuel said during a National Press Club event last month.

""The idea that you are going to actually have a post-high school educational plan and all of a sudden we're putting a burden on our kids' backs -- I guarantee you the kids in Chicago will be better prepared for the future than any other child. Every other school system today leaves it to chance.""

About 60% of district students have post-secondary plans when they graduate, Emanuel said.

""I cannot in good conscience as a mayor allow the other 40% to not have a plan that the economy will require of them later in life,"" he said. ""Will achieving this require more of us? Yes, of course. But as a parent I would never leave it to chance that my kids have a plan post-high school, and as mayor I refuse the notion that the future of any child in this city should be treated any differently.""

Despite a high school graduation rate of about 73%, the number of Chicago students going on to college has not been promising. An estimated 18% of ninth-graders graduate high school and go on to earn a bachelor's degree within 10 years of starting high school, according to a 2016 study by the University of Chicago's Consortium on School Research

""A K-12 model was relevant 10, 15, 20 years ago,"" Emanuel said in April when announcing the initiative. ""The city of Chicago is moving toward a pre-K to college model.""

'A good plan on paper'

The school system laid off nearly 500 teachers and more than 1,000 support staff in 2015, but Janice Jackson, chief education officer for the public schools, said the new initiative will not place additional strain on the workload of guidance counselors.

Chicago school offcial Janice Jackson says the plan won't place extra burdens on guidance counselors.

Still, the district and city officials are working to raise about $1 million to pay for eight additional college and career coaches.

""This requires a mind shift,"" Jackson said. ""We are shifting hearts and minds about what children in urban school districts can do.""

Jackson noted that the new requirement would be waived for students with ""extenuating circumstances.""

""The population here in Chicago is extremely diverse, and while many of our kids have struggles to overcome to be successful in school, we wanted to make sure we were taking those things into consideration,"" she said without elaborating.

But critics are not convinced.

Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis said the plan was poorly thought out and would place additional burdens on counselors.

""Sounds like a good plan on paper, but I also wonder what do kids know what they want to do at or accomplish at 17 years old,"" Lewis said.

""I can't imagine you do all the work you do to graduate that you get your diploma withheld from you."""

Yet at virtually every turn, that case has already been presented in scripted dramas.

Drug dealers remain go-to bad guys in TV and movies. Dating back to David Simon's landmark HBO drama ""The Wire"" and miniseries ""The Corner,"" though, television has drilled into the hopelessness of law enforcement's efforts -- depicting what amounts to a giant game of Whac-a-Mole, where cutting off from one spigot simply opens another.

The condemnation of the policy, moreover, is often conveyed more poignantly through dramas like ""The Wire,"" which can personalize character arcs and put faces -- even if they're fictional -- on the statistics.

A bleak new FX drama premiering this week, ""Snowfall,"" seeks to join this tradition. The show hearkens back to the ""Just Say No"" era, chronicling the rise of crack cocaine in the 1980s.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/10/politics/donald-trump-russia/index.html,THE EVER-CHANGING RUSSIA STORIES OF THE TWO DONALD TRUMPS,"Washington (CNN) When it comes to Russia, Donald Trump -- and his son -- can't get their stories straight.

Consider the last day and a half.

On Saturday, Donald Trump Jr. said that a 2016 meeting between himself and a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin was primarily about ""adoptions."" That came in response to a New York Times piece detailing the meeting between Trump, then campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.

On Sunday, when the Times reported a second piece alleging that Trump Jr. had met with Veselnitskaya after receiving a promise that she possessed ""damaging information"" about Hillary Clinton, he changed his story.

""After pleasantries were exchanged, the woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton,"" Trump Jr. said in a statement. ""Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.""

Then there was this odd reversal from the President himself on another matter involving Russia.

On Sunday at 7:50 a.m., President Trump tweeted : ""Putin & I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit so that election hacking, & many other negative things, will be guarded.""

On Sunday at 8:45 p.m., President Trump tweeted : ""The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit doesn't mean I think it can happen. It can't-but a ceasefire can,& did!""

So. That's a lot to process.

As of Monday morning, here's what we know (I think):

1. At the behest of a friend he made from the Miss Universe pageant, which was held in Russia in 2013, Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer who promised him dirt on Clinton. He has said he didn't know the name of the person prior to the meeting, but we now know that person was Veselnitskaya. He said he didn't tell Manafort or Kushner anything about the meeting -- other than to ask them to come.

2. Trump Jr. initially said the meeting was primarily about adoption when initially confronted about it by the Times on Saturday. He did not mention that it had anything to do with the 2016 election despite the fact that Veselnitskaya's promise of negative information appears to have been the impetus for the meeting in the first place.

3. At the much-anticipated meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters that Trump confronted Putin about meddling in the election. Putin denied it. Reports differ about whether Trump accepted that denial or not (Russia says he did, the White House says he didn't).

4. The two sides agreed to put the Russian campaign meddling (or not) in the past -- by, in part, discussing the possibility of creating an ""impenetrable Cyber Security unit"" to make election hacking a thing of the past. After a huge amount of blowback to that proposal Sunday -- Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, tweeted: ""Partnering with Putin on a 'Cyber Security Unit' is akin to partnering with Assad on a 'Chemical Weapons Unit'"" -- Trump changed his tune, insisting that he didn't really think the ""cyber security unit"" would happen anyway.

Got all that?

The point here is simple: With each passing week, the story seems to change when it comes to Trump and Russia. And, in almost every instance, what we find is more smoke around those connections. We don't have fire yet -- as Trump like to remind people (and he's right). But, man oh man, the smoke just keeps getting thicker.

Why, even if he didn't know exactly who he was meeting with, did Don Jr. take the meeting -- with the promise that he would get dirt on Hillary Clinton? (Remember that Trump Jr. knew this was someone who was a friend of a friend he had made in Russia -- meaning that it doesn't take much of a logical leap to think this person he was meeting with might be Russian.)

And does President Trump think it's a good idea to form a cybersecurity task force with Russia? Or not? If he does support it, why did he walk away from it -- or hedge on it -- 12 hours after he seemed to suggest it was the successful result of his confrontation with Putin?

Like almost everything with Trump and Russia, there are more questions than answers. And, if past is prologue, Trump and his senior advisers won't answer any of them."

The views expressed in this commentary are her own.

(CNN) Americans, along with the rest of the world, are trying to figure out what's behind President Donald Trump's grotesque barrage of attacks on the media, ironically revved up just in time for the Fourth of July.

Some wonder if they reflect a thin skin and lack of impulse control -- perhaps a sign of immaturity or even mental distress -- or if the behavior is part of a strategy; a calculated effort to obtain specific political results.

But whether by design or by impulse, Trump is in practice following the authoritarian playbook. He displays the instincts of a populist autocrat. He didn't need to read books about Mussolini, study Hugo Chavez's maneuvers, or become schooled in the tactics of Vladimir Putin. He has shown these things are in his blood.

Indeed, he appears not to want to govern so much as rule.

We discern this in his lack understanding or respect for the foundational and sacrosanct principles of the United States -- among them a free press and the right to criticize the president -- but also from his apparent desire to accumulate power by manipulating public opinion, dividing the country, eroding freedoms, and weakening institutions that are not in his control.

JUST WATCHED More than 10% of Trump's recent tweets have been attacks on press Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH More than 10% of Trump's recent tweets have been attacks on press 04:09

Autocrats of the past tended to grab power in one overpowering charge. That won't do in an age in which democracy is all-but universally accepted as the only legitimate form of government. The process now requires incrementalism. You boil the frog slowly.

Let me be clear: I do not think Trump intends to become America's dictator -- although he might not mind that. But I do think his instincts and tactics aim to undercut America's democracy to increase his power.

First, it allows him to create his own reality. By discrediting the media, he can claim that any bit of news that he doesn't like is simply untrue.

JUST WATCHED Acosta: We're witnessing erosion of freedoms Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Acosta: We're witnessing erosion of freedoms 01:51

But there's more. Trump is promoting divisions and creating enemies, not just for him but for his supporters.

Authoritarian leaders do best in such tense environments, with rifts and hatred taking the place of common goals and reasoned debate.

Take a step back and think about the issues Americans should be discussing. In theory, everyone wants a better health care system, a well-functioning immigration structure, a thriving economy. Instead, Trump has fueled the flames of partisanship, and what should be a discussion about the best way to achieve shared goals has become bitter hostility. The two sides have become enemies.

His deranged Twitter stream is not aimed at persuading anyone, but riling his base. It's an emotional blowtorch.

The tweet where Trump violently slams a man wearing a CNN face was reportedly first circulated days earlier by one of his supporters, who has a track record of posting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and insulting Muslims, gays and women. It is this material Trump chooses to promote. It is material he could be either personally seeking out or perhaps instructing his aides to find for him.

The effect is to further divide America, to hurt not only its international standing but its democracy; turning its citizens into each other's enemies.

It is five months into his presidency, and an ever-more riven nation is celebrating America's first Independence Day since Trump took office -- a new President whose governing motto might well read E pluribus pluribus: from many, many."

Both countries have boosted production since they were exempted from an OPEC-led deal to cut output, weighing on global prices LCOc1. This has prompted more talk among producers about including them in the pact. ""We have spoken to (OPEC Secretary General Mohammad) Barkindo and in the next two weeks there will be conversations with them (Libya and Nigeria) and possibly we will invite them to the technical summit,"" Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told reporters on the sidelines of an industry conference in Istanbul. Six ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC nations including Kuwait, Venezuela, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Oman will meet on July 24 in St Petersburg, Russia, to discuss the current situation in the oil market.  Nigeria's oil minister, Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, was invited to the meeting but is unable to attend due to another commitment, Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam al-Marzouq told reporters at the same Istanbul event. Instead, the group will probably ask a technical committee involving the six OPEC and non-OPEC members, which is due to convene before the ministers hold their talks, to meet Nigerian and Libyan representatives to discuss their production plans, he said. ""We extended the invitation but unfortunately there is a previous commitment for the Nigerian oil minister,"" the minister said. ""We did not talk about capping, at least we can talk about production plans right now,"" he added. The monitoring panel, called the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee which Kuwait chairs, could recommend expanding the pact to the wider group, which holds its next meeting in November.  Both Nigeria and Libya were given exemptions to the supply cut, under which OPEC, Russia and other non-OPEC producers are reducing their output by about 1.8 million barrels per day because their output has been curbed by conflict.  OPEC delegates have said bringing Nigeria or Libya into the production pact would likely focus on capping their output, rather than asking them to cut their supply so soon after it had recovered from involuntary curbs. Kachikwu has said that Nigeria was not opposed in principle to joining OPEC's production cap, but would have to wait and see if production returned to acceptable levels. OPEC has not been in touch with Libya on the issue of capping the country's output, an OPEC delegate said. The Libyan government has not received an invitation to attend the ministerial meeting in Russia, he added. In comments to Reuters on Monday, the head of Libya's National Oil Corporation did not indicate any willingness to cap output yet, saying Libya's humanitarian problems must be considered in any talks on the subject.

(CNN) Ordering fast food can be tricky for people who are trying to eat healthfully, but it can be particularly challenging for vegetarians. Menus are often limited in vegetarian staples such as beans, lentils, whole grains and vegetables.

The good news is that more and more restaurants are catering to meatless customers, which now number approximately 8 million adults in the United States, with many more trying to eat less meat in general for health reasons.

""I am seeing more options out there for plant-based eaters who want to grab fast food,"" said Sharon Palmer, a vegetarian, nutritionist and author of ""Plant-Powered for Life.""

Vegetarian dining requires some careful planning, however. Here are some tips and strategies for eating well at fast food restaurants if you are a vegetarian or vegan:

Check out menus in advance. Since some chains have more vegetarian options than others, you should go online or try calling a restaurant to see whether there's something you will eat. If the menu seems limited, it may be worth traveling a bit farther if it means you'll get healthier, more appealing meatless options.

The SECs review may push the matter up the agenda of the regulators new chairman, Jay Clayton.Its not surprising that the funding structure is under scrutiny, said Tyler Gellasch, a former SEC official whos now at the Healthy Markets Association, a market-structure advisory group with members including OppenheimerFunds and Janus Capital Group. It is surprising that its taken this long for the SEC to show any inclination that it appreciates the conflicts of interest posed by having one set of for-profit entities setting the costs for other market participants, including some of their competitors.The SEC declined to comment.Today when the SEC wants to probe trading, it can take days with current technology because it often has to collect the data from different systems. The CAT aims to change that. Its design was approved in November, and Thesys Technologies LLC was picked to build the database in January.Exchanges wanted traders to cover about three-quarters of the CATs operating costs. The more trading data they create, the more they pay.The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a trade group for brokers and money managers, argued a month ago that their voices had been ignored and that the SEC should review whether to approve or reject the fee plan. On June 30, the regulator did just that and temporarily suspended the levies. Sifma members include finance giants like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., as well as Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.The exchanges and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the industry-funded Wall Street regulator that also oversees the CAT, say they didnt ignore critiques when deciding how much to charge.Broker-dealers and other market participants had ample opportunity to provide input into the CAT funding model, they said in a June 29 comment letter.OTC Markets Group Inc. runs a trading system where investors can buy or sell mostly tiny stocks -- typically companies not eligible for listing by the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Stock Market. Its chief executive officer says his firm is being asked to contribute too much to the CAT, even though its far smaller than most exchanges.Thats anticompetitive, said Cromwell Coulson, CEO of OTC Markets Group. The SEC has an obligation to make sure CAT fees are fairly allocated.Much like setting rates for public utilities, everyone makes the case that someone else should bear the cost, said James Angel, a Georgetown University finance professor who studies trading. We have a very complex market structure and need a complex information system. The question is: How cost effective is that system going to be?"
http://cnn.com/2017/07/10/opinions/russia-probe-money-laundering-database-opinion-zeldin/index.html,WHY RUSSIA-PROBE INVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING AT ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING DATABASE,"Michael Zeldin, a CNN legal analyst, has served as a federal prosecutor in the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice and was a special counsel to then-Assistant Attorney General Robert Mueller. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) It has been reported that the Senate and House Intelligence committees investigating possible ties between Trump campaign officials and the Russians have begun to receive access to financial data from the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

FinCEN's mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit use and to combat money laundering and promote national security through the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence and the strategic use of the government's enforcement authority.

It does this, in part, by maintaining a database of over 200 million reports of financial transactions.

These reports come from more than 80,000 financial institutions and 500,000 individuals who maintain foreign bank accounts.

FinCEN makes this information available to law enforcement and other government authorities for use in criminal, tax and regulatory investigations and proceedings and in intelligence and counterintelligence activities to protect against international terrorism.

At first glance, the FinCEN data would appear to be unrelated to the central question of whether there was collusion to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.

While no evidence has been released to date that bears on this question, there are good reasons to think that House investigators and Special Counsel Robert Mueller will look closely at the FinCEN data to determine its relevance to their investigations.

How might FinCEN data be relevant?

The House Committee on Financial Services in its request to FinCEN for documents indicated that it is interested in the FinCEN data to assist in determining the extent of any undue influence on the President and his administration from Russian government officials, oligarchs and organized crime leaders, in connection with the 2016 presidential election.

The committee asked for certain records that may shed light on President Trump's financial transactions with, and business ties to, Russia. That includes information about the financial accounts of President Trump, his family members, and his business associates, and any suspicious transactions relating to the Trump Organization, including the Taj Mahal Casino Resort , in which Trump retained an ownership or other financial interest from 1990 through 2014, when the casino resort was purchased by Carl Icahn.

(The Trump Taj Mahal Casino was assessed a civil money penalty by FinCEN in 2015 for willfully violating the Bank Secrecy Act's program, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements from 2010 through 2012. Many of these violations were cited by the Internal Revenue Service in previous examinations of Trump Taj Mahal dating back to 2003. It is not publicly known whether any of the activity related in any way to the subject of the current investigation.)

US money laundering laws

There are two primary types of money laundering laws in the United States: (1) laws that make money laundering itself a crime, found in title 18 United State Code Sections 1956 and 1957; and (2) laws that assist in the investigation and prosecution of money laundering, terrorist financing, and other criminal activity, found in Title 31 United States Code Section 5311 and implementing regulations (also known as The Bank Secrecy Act or BSA), including requirements to report large currency transactions, suspicious activity, foreign financial accounts, and high-end residential real estate transactions.

The Money Laundering Statutes

Broadly speaking, under the criminal money laundering statutes, it is a crime for any person to engage knowingly in a financial transaction with knowledge that the transaction involves the proceeds of criminal activity. The courts have interpreted knowledge to include actual knowledge and willful blindness -- deliberately avoiding gaining knowledge when faced with a high likelihood of criminal activity, i.e.,ignoring red flags of suspicious activity.

For example, if a US person were to accept payment for a condominium with knowledge that the source of the funds used in the transaction was derived from some form of criminal activity, then that person potentially could be charged with violating the money laundering statutes.

The Bank Secrecy Act

The Bank Secrecy Act requires certain financial institutions (for example, banks, broker dealers, and casinos) to develop, implement and maintain anti-money laundering compliance programs. Financial institutions also are required to file a number of reports and maintain a variety of records, including currency transactions reports on cash transactions over $10,000 (CTRs) and suspicious activity reports (SARs).

JUST WATCHED Warner: Absolutely want to meet with Trump Jr. Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Warner: Absolutely want to meet with Trump Jr. 10:13

SARs generally must be filed when a financial institution knows, suspects or has reason to suspect that a transaction: (1) involves money laundering activity or a violation of the Bank Secrecy Act, including structuring of transactions to evade the CTR requirement; (2) has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the sort of transaction in which the particular customer would normally be expected to engage; or (3) involves the use of the financial institution to facilitate criminal activity.

All persons, including financial institutions, other legal entities, and individuals, are required to file an annual report of their foreign financial accounts if the aggregate value in the accounts at any time during the calendar year exceeded $10,000 (FBARs).

Therefore, if any CTRs, SARs or FBARs were filed relating to Trump , his family members, his associates, or the Trump organization, these reports would be included in the FinCEN data. This, in turn, could provide insights into the transactions and investigative leads in furtherance of Congress' and/or Mueller's investigations.

Reporting of high-end real estate purchases

As one of the responses taken by law enforcement to address this threat, FinCEN, in 2016, issued Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) which temporarily require certain U.S. title insurance companies in a number of major geographic areas to identify the people behind legal entities used to pay ""all cash"" for high-end residential real estate.

These areas include all of the boroughs of New York City; the counties of Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach in Florida; the counties of Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara in California, and the Texas county of Bexar (San Antonio).

FinCEN's concern is that all-cash purchases -- i.e., those without bank financing -- may be conducted by individuals attempting to hide their identity and assets by purchasing residential properties through limited liability companies (LLCs) or other opaque structures.

Donald Trump, Jr., executive vice president of development and acquisitions for the Trump real estate businesses, told the ""Bridging U.S. and Emerging Markets Real Estate"" conference in Manhattan in September 2008:

""[I]n terms of high-end product influx into the United States, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets; say in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.""

The FinCEN data might shed light on the sources of these investment dollars and the identities of the people involved in the real estate purchases

Beyond the inquiry into the direct investment by Russians in Trump properties, there is interest in the relationship between Trump business interests and Deutsche Bank. As has been reported by Donna Borak for CNN Money, Deutsche Bank , which recently paid significant penalties relating to its involvement in an alleged Russian money-laundering scheme, is ""in the crosshairs of Democrats looking into the bank's ties to President Trump.""

Specifically, in the House committee's May 23, 2017 letter seeking access to FinCEN data, the committee raised with Treasury the need for information relating to President Trump and his alleged financial ties to Russia, and information pertaining to ""President Trump's biggest lender and the only bank known to lend to the President after his bankruptcies, Deutsche Bank.""

Tione got the fuel at a discount and avoided storage fees and sales taxes. But YPF also benefited. With low crude prices eroding profit, the company is using such deals to expand into a vibrant local farm industry and gain access to dollar-based export markets for grain.Barter arrangements are on the rise in Argentina as commodities hold their value better than cash. While the country remains one of the worlds top grain and oilseed growers, easing Argentines off a decade of energy subsidies is fueling an inflation rate of around 24 percent. With YPF eager to swap more fuel for crops, the energy company has emerged as a major agricultural trader, competing with domestic cooperatives and international exporters like Cargill Inc. and Louis Dreyfus Co.Farmers now see us as one of them, said Marcos Capdepont, a former executive in YPFs liquefied natural gas unit who has been head of agribusiness since 2010.YPF is generating about $1.4 billion in annual revenue from agriculture, just as Argentinas farm industry is being encouraged to crank up production. Since President Mauricio Macri took office in December 2015, he has scrapped export taxes and eased shipping permits after years of stifling protectionist policies discouraged growers under his predecessor, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.Argentina is harvesting a record 40 million tons of corn this year, and the soy crop is the second-largest ever at 57.8 million tons, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Grain exports and shipments of soy-based vegetable oil and animal feed are forecast at all-time highs. Aided by cheap credit for machinery and better yields with more widespread use of fertilizers, farmers are enjoying their best prospects in a decade.As domestic agriculture grows, a bear market in crude has eroded profit from oil and gas at YPF. The company is also struggling to lure partners to a massive shale deposit in Patagonia. To make up the gap, YPF is expanding outside of energy into industries such as agriculture, mining and electricity, which are expected to benefit from Macris market-oriented policies.West Texas Intermediate crude oil has slumped 18 percent this year to $44.21 barrel in New York. Benchmark soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade are up less than 1 percent during the period to $10.085 a bushel. YPFs American depositary receipts dropped 0.3 percent to $21.98 at 10:55 a.m. in New York.This year, YPF is on track to trade 1.5 millions tons of corn, soybeans and wheat, up from 1.2 million tons in 2016, and the goal is to get to 3 million tons by 2020, Capdepont said.Argentina is the worlds biggest exporter of soy-based vegetable oil and animal feed, and YPF is tapping into that market with the crops it collects from farmers. The company pays processors including Cargill, Louis Dreyfus and Glencore Plc to crush its soybeans, and then sells the products overseas. YPF is collecting so much that it may build its own port, which could cost $100 million, Capdepont said.An employee observes two oil drilling rigs at the YPF SA Vaca Muerta Shale oil reservoir in Patagonian province.About 10 percent of YPF revenue comes from agriculture, either in the form of grain shipments or sales of diesel, fertilizer and other farm products to growers. A growing part of that business is barter trades, many of which are occurring at more than 100 YPF Directo stores around the country, some on the sites of former grain silos. The company plans to add 12 more retail outlets this year.Gabriel Martinatto, 46, runs one of the YPF Directo stores in Arroyito, Cordoba, the province that accounts for about a quarter of Argentinas soy production and a third of its corn. Martinatto traded 5,000 tons of grain with farmers last year, mainly for diesel. He also pushed YPF-branded products, including agricultural chemicals made by Rizobacter SA and seeds from Don Mario SA, and sometimes sweetened deals with a free drone, silo bag or laptop. Martinatto said he expects revenue to grow by 8 percent this year.For growers like Gustavo Tione, such transactions are preferable to cash. On the day of his trade last month, soybeans were fetching about 3,800 pesos a ton, valuing the shipment at around 114,000 pesos, which would have been enough to buy about 7,350 liters of diesel. He said he got more than 8,000 liters that day from YPF, which will be used to power machinery during the wheat-planting season. He also wont have to wait months for the government rebate he gets on cash sales or worry about silo commissions.A YPF salesman speaks to an attendee at an agricultural fair in the Santa Fe province of Argentina.I like the grain barter because its more agile, Tione said at an agricultural fair in Santa Fe province, the heart of Argentinas fertile Pampas region, where YPF salesmen were making trades. Tiones farm is in Maciel.YPF supplies about 57 percent of the diesel used by Argentinas farmers. Its also targeting market-share growth in lubricants and fertilizers, and expanding into the consulting business with a couple of agronomists already working out of each YPF Directo store.Agriculture is so promising that YPF rivals are looking to expand in the market, including Oil Combustibles SA and Axion Energy SA.Farming is one of the few green shoots in Argentinas economy, YPFs Capdepont said. We know theyre following our trail."

""No memo was given to me that was marked 'classified,'"" Daniel Richman told CNN. ""No memo was passed on to the Times.""

Richman did share the contents of one memo, he said, but ""the substance of the memo passed on to the Times was not marked classified and to my knowledge remains unclassified.""

That will probably be followed by another increase later this year.That puts to bed a three-year exercise in crisis management that saw policy makers run the economies of Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal hot in order to buy the country time to recover from falling oil prices.It could be a thankless victory. Albertans, barely out of a deep recession, can do without the higher borrowing costs and rising currency. In Toronto and Vancouver, resentment over real estate bubbles and debt accumulation could linger for years.And Governor Stephen Polozs reward? Hell be back to where he started in 2014 -- concerned about weak productivity, challenging demographics, sluggish business investment and exports and trying not to tilt the economy into a recession as he returns rates to more normal levels.The Bank of Canada seems to be putting quite a bit of weight on the rebound in Alberta.Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins kicked off the hawkish comments by saying the recovery had broadened to more industries and now included even the hard-hit energy regions like Alberta.Bank of Canada officials have also indicated that the two rate cuts in 2015 that brought the central banks benchmark rate to 0.5 percent have done their job.Alberta is likely to have the strongest provincial growth among all regions this year, demonstrating that the adjustment to lower oil prices has largely taken place, said Craig Alexander, chief economist at the Conference Board of Canada in Ottawa. The implication is that, at the minimum, the Bank of Canada should return the overnight rate to 1 percent.At the same time, no one would mistake this for boom times either. Employment levels in Alberta are still down from records, and what jobs have been created are in lower paying services. Over the last three years, Alberta is still down 96,300 jobs in goods production.Plus, about a quarter of growth this year is related to a normal bounce back from the hit taken last year from wildfires in the province, said Michael Dolega, senior economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank. The recovery will be a shallow one, Dolega said.Look no further than Calgarys office vacancy numbers. According to Calgary Economic Development, the city has a 25 percent downtown office vacancy rate, five times the level in Toronto, with the cheapest rents among major Canadian cities."

Company received reports of consumer allergic reactions

(CNN) Three Clif Bar products are being recalled due to the possible presence of undeclared peanuts and some tree nuts in the products, the US Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday.

""Clif Bar discovered this issue when it received a small number of consumer complaints alleging peanut or tree nut allergic reactions,"" the announcement said. ""There are no confirmed illnesses associated with this recall.""

Clif Bar & Co. is recalling Clif Builder's Bar Chocolate Mint flavor, Clif Kid Zbar Protein Chocolate Mint and Clif Kid Zbar Protein Chocolate Chip, along with snack sizes and variety packs. The announcement has a full list of the package sizes that are affected, along with lot codes.

The bars may contain peanuts and some tree nuts, including hazelnuts, almonds, walnuts, macadamia nuts, Brazil nuts, pecans, cashews and coconuts, according to the announcement. They are sold in stores and online throughout the United States.

People who do not have nut allergies can safely consume the recalled products. No other Clif Bar products have been affected, the FDA said.

http://cnn.com/2017/06/13/africa/nigerian-magazine-a-nasty-boy/index.html,IS THIS NIGERIA'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL MAGAZINE?,"(CNN) Bold, disruptive and totally unapologetic, a new Nigerian online magazine 'A Nasty Boy,' is set to ruffle a few feathers.

""Sometimes our visual content will not be safe for the workplace... we won't make it any easier for you with our provocative editorials and swear words; take it in good spirits,"" read's the magazine's disclaimer.

The magazine is filled with provocative images, featuring nude models, articles contain swear words and avant-garde ideas.

In Nigeria, a conservative country, where public expressions of nudity are uncommon, 'A Nasty Boy' is unsurprisingly causing controversy.

But for editor Richard Akuson, the publication is sending out a clear message: he's not interested in fitting the status quo.

'There has to be room for people that don't fit in'

Growing up, Akuson says he was bullied for being different.

""I was always called a boy-girl,"" Akuson told CNN.

""In university, I was called a yansh man which means a guy with a big butt...my classmates thought I was too polite, in their words too polished and that was not the way guys were meant to be.""

It was this idea, that a man or woman is meant to behave in a particular way, that Akuson sought to challenge through 'A Nasty Boy.'

Photos: Boys: An editorial by Richard Akuson Photos: Boys: An editorial by Richard Akuson In his editorial 'Boys' Richard Akuson hopes to challenge the concept of Nigerian masculinity. Hide Caption 1 of 5 Photos: Boys: An editorial by Richard Akuson Taken by Photographer Zamani Istifanus, they put together three muscular male models who are completely naked. Hide Caption 2 of 5 Photos: Boys: An editorial by Richard Akuson With the photos, Akuson challenges the perceived notion of strangeness that comes with men being naked around one another. Hide Caption 3 of 5 Photos: Boys: An editorial by Richard Akuson After publishing the photos on his website , he decided to post on his personal Instagram page and observed a certain hesitation to like his photos despite analytics revealing a wide reach. Hide Caption 4 of 5 Photos: Boys: An editorial by Richard Akuson ""I could see a fear to associate with an editorial like that."" Akuson says. ""If a friend sees someone looking at a post like that, there would be questions. They might have liked it but didn't have the confidence to show that openly."" Hide Caption 5 of 5

""There cannot be one singular kind of Nigerian man or woman, there has to be room for other definitions that don't necessarily fit that opinion,"" he adds.

Akuson had previously launched three other publications but says none of them felt right, he was pushed to publish 'A Nasty Boy,' after a run in with internet trolls.

Celebrating 'otherness'

""I once did a story on EJ Johnson... and how I felt his wardrobe could inspire, but the conversation in the comment section completely moved from the subject matter to me. 'Why are you always interested in stories like this?; and some responses were 'Oh you know Richard is gay'""

""That was the awakening for me,"" he said. ""And from that morning I knew I would start 'A Nasty Boy.'""

Akuson says after his experience he knew the time had come for a platform that allowed for self-expression and shape-shifting ideas and explored ""otherness in fashion, people and culture.""

""There are people who do not fit the status quo but are however very Nigerian,"" he explains. ""We should hear their stories and also celebrate them.""

'Fear of association'

While the public is slowly warming up to his publication, there is still fear and hesitation to be publicly associated with the magazine Akuson claims.

A large chunk of the magazine's readership resides in Nigeria, Akuson notes that the number isn't reflected in their social engagement. He feels it's because people are still weary to be publicly associated with subject matter that could be considered taboo.

In an photo editorial called 'Boys', Akuson tried to challenged the perceived notion of strangeness surrounding men being naked around one another. After it was published, he observed something unusual.

""I could see from my analytics that the photo had been seen many times but the engagement was not as much. Then I got messages and calls from people who thought it was impressive work and I asked, 'why didn't you leave a comment?'""

Funding also poses a huge problem for his ambitious publication with potential investors questioning its importance.

""We have met people who just say outright that this is not a necessary publication, it could be something else, and it doesn't have to be this. They don't understand why it's necessary.""

Bold and unapologetic

But Akuson does, and is driven by the effect the magazine has on people who connect to the message and need to celebrate difference.

Akuson shares the story of a photographer who collaborated with him on an editorial, whose father broke his camera because he found photos of naked men on it. The incident prompted the photographer to give up on photography, but seeing his work in 'A Nasty Boy' feature on a British website lit his fire again.

Financial setbacks and going against the grain of Nigeria's conservative principle aside, Akuson's focus is in one direction and he is doing it boldly, and unapologetically."
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-illinois-budget-idUSKBN19V0BQ,BIG FINANCIAL WOES LINGER IN ILLINOIS' NEW BUDGET,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois' first budget after two years is filled with partial outlines to address its debt-ridden pension system and unpaid bill backlog -- signs that political fighting and the fiscal mess in the nation's fifth-largest state are far from over. At least 15 House and Senate Republicans broke with first-term Republican Governor Bruce Rauner on Thursday and joined with Democrats to override Rauner's vetoes of the state's first budget package in more than two years.  The $36 billion spending plan relies on a $5 billion tax increase that permanently hikes the flat personal income tax rate to 4.95 percent, up 32 percent from its prior 3.75 percent rate. To address the state's nearly $15 billion in unpaid bills, Illinois depends heavily on borrowing. Lawmakers approved $6 billion of 12-year bonds to raise money for repayments. But State Representative Greg Harris, the House Democrats' point person on the budget, has acknowledged there is only enough revenue to support half of that borrowing amount.  Illinois will also borrow up to $1.2 billion from various state accounts that have accumulated cash for specific purposes, while ""sweeping"" cash from other accounts --a government version of looking under couch cushions that is expected to yield $300 million.  Illinois' $130 billion pension liability is one of the largest in the nation, and the new budget takes only small steps to address the structural underfunding of Illinois' five retirement systems.  The new law gives the state five years to phase in changes retroactive to fiscal 2014 in actuarial or investment return assumptions made by the pension systems for an estimated savings of $892.1 million.  Seemingly small changes in projected investment results can have significant impact on a pension fund's actuarial calculations. Last year, when the Illinois Teachers' Retirement System reduced its earnings assumption to 7 percent from 7.5 percent, the change caused a $660 million spike in the state's fiscal 2018 contribution. The new budget attributes $500 million in savings to the creation of a new tier of pension beneficiaries. But that tier applies largely to newly hired employees, raising questions about how the state expects to book that savings in the current fiscal year. That estimate was lifted straight from the proposed budget presented by Rauner earlier this year. The projection has not been independently verified by legislative leaders, and Rauner's office has not responded to requests for an explanation of how the estimate was calculated.  The Illinois Education Association, one of the state's largest unions, said it has no evidence that its pensioners would be harmed by the new budget's pension provisions. But the union questioned why lawmakers approved structural changes to pensions without an independent financial analysis.  ""It's a little bit of a shot in the dark. For something this major, you'd think the legislators who are voting on this would want to know this information,"" said Jim Reed, the union's government relations director. A budget was welcomed as a positive step for Illinois, which still faces fiscal and pension crises. ""The pension pressures will continue, and Illinois' financial challenges will continue, but at least there will be a framework to recognize there's a limit to the liability growth to this state,"" said Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation, a budget watchdog group. Steve Malanga, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute think tank, said the fixes in the new budget do not match up to the challenges faced by Illinois. ""This is the kind of budget you would pass if you were a state that hit a bump in the road and had a deficit you needed to get rid of over the next two or three years,"" he said. ""It's not the kind of budget you'd pass if you have $14 billion in unpaid bills and a $130 billion unfunded (pension) liability."" The Democrats and Republicans who voted for the budget did so at least in part to prevent Illinois from becoming the first U.S. state in history to see its credit rating fall to ""junk"" status. Moody's on Wednesday put Illinois on review for a possible downgrade, but some of the state's bonds traded higher on Friday, an apparent sign of optimism about the budget.       Additional reporting by Julia Jacobs; Editing by David Greising and Sandra Maler"
http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/08/technology/culture/sexism-silicon-valley-code-of-conduct/index.html?section=money_topstories,WHY SEXISM HAS FESTERED FOR SO LONG IN SILICON VALLEY,"In just two weeks, two powerful Silicon Valley investors have resigned from the firms they cofounded after women accused them of sexual harassment.

The men, 500 Startups cofounder Dave McClure and Binary Capital cofounder Justin Caldbeck, didn't just cross the line once, according to the allegations. Multiple women -- both employees at their firms and female founders -- have come forward about their mistreatment of women.

Silicon Valley's power dynamics don't favor women and minorities. Investors tend to be white men: 89% of those making investment decisions at the top 72 firms are male, according to one industry survey. Many women have said they fear retaliation if they speak out about inappropriate behavior.

""Tech companies too often make witches out of vocal women,"" wrote designer Julie Ann Horvath in a 2015 Medium post about discrimination and harassment in the tech industry. Horvath had previously spoken out about her own experience being sexually harassed.

But across the tech industry, there are some glaring problems that have allowed sexism to fester beneath the surface.

Gag orders prevent honest conversations about harassment and culture

Non-disparagement clauses are common in Silicon Valley, where they are typically required as part of a settlement or executive employment agreement. They prevent people from speaking out about the inner workings of a company, including talking about the behavior of former coworkers or bosses.

The agreements themselves are common in the workplace, but they're especially problematic in an industry that's overwhelming white and male -- especially if they're used to sweep harassment allegations under the rug.

Axios reported that in 2013, Stitch Fix founder Katrina Lake told Caldbeck's then-employer, Lightspeed Venture Partners, that he had harassed her. Caldbeck was a board member of Lake's startup at the time. Lightspeed agreed to remove Caldbeck from the board, but Lake signed a non-disparagement clause. She did so to prevent being blocked from future investment opportunities, Axios wrote. Lightspeed tweeted that it regrets not taking stronger action against Caldbeck: ""It is clear now that we should have done more.""

Non-disparagement agreements ""are everywhere,"" said Rita C. Tobin, an employment attorney who has represented both individuals and businesses. ""There's a real coercive element in this.""

People are still allowed to file discrimination claims with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, but Tobin said the agreements effectively silence victims.

""People don't realize how widespread sex discrimination, sexual harassment and age discrimination are. The public doesn't get the message because people can't speak out, at least not in their own names,"" she said. ""These should be declared unenforceable as a matter of public policy.""

Susan Fowler, an engineer who blew the whistle on sexual harassment at Uber earlier this year, has also called for an end to non-disparagement agreements. ""It ... unfairly targets the most economically and socially vulnerable employees,"" she wrote in a blog post.

Coraline Ada Ehmke said she opted not to sign a settlement agreement when leaving GitHub in May so she could speak openly about the company's culture. It was an expensive decision: She told CNN Tech it meant leaving about $20,000 on the table. This week, Ehmke published an extensive blog post about her negative experience at the company, which she said ""touts its values, but has consistently failed to live up to them.""

Non-disparagement agreements are used to ""silence people who are already very vulnerable,"" Ehmke told CNN Tech. ""I'm very senior and well-known. I'm resilient enough and that's a privilege I've had.""

A GitHub spokesperson said the company doesn't comment on personnel issues. ""At GitHub, we have worked hard to build a diverse and inclusive culture and are committed to these values at every level of the company,"" the spokesperson said.

The founder-investor relationship is undefined

The relationship between entrepreneurs and investors is inherently nontraditional. There's no formal employer-employee relationship, and there are often many meetings before a deal is signed.

It's not uncommon for those meetings to be at bars over drinks. Entrepreneurs often say they take whatever time they can get with well-known investors.

In the case of Caldbeck, multiple women told CNN Tech and other news outlets that he overstepped professional boundaries when they were seeking funding. They have alleged everything from inappropriate late night texts to groping a founder's thigh under the table. While initially denying the claims and calling them ""attacks on my character,"" Caldbeck issued a broad apology one day later, stating he was deeply ashamed of his lack of self-awareness.

Related: He touched my breast. Is that harassment?

One female founder, who preferred to remain anonymous, told CNN Tech she was working on financial projections with an investor at his office, which was located in the basement of his home. Upon finishing the work, the investor stood up, exposing his fully erect penis to her.

Another entrepreneur, Cheryl Yeoh, recounted her own harassment experience in a lengthy blog post last week. McClure and several others were at her apartment in Malaysia to brainstorm a new accelerator program, Yeoh said. McClure, who was an investor in her startup, stayed behind when the others left, aggressively propositioning and kissing her, she said.

Yeoh told CNN Tech that prior to posting her story, she emailed McClure her account of what happened. He responded, stating that he was ashamed and sorry, Yeoh said. Last week, McClure apologized generally for his bad behavior toward ""multiple women."" He didn't mention Yeoh by name.

The past two weeks have seen a flood of stories from women sharing similar experiences. It's left some questioning how to better guide the relationship between entrepreneurs and investors.

The Information reported on Wednesday that a group of investors is drafting a code of conduct to be presented to the National Venture Capital Association. The goal is to work together to combat sexual harassment in tech.

Ross Fubini, founder of XYZ Ventures, is involved in the effort. He told CNN Tech the idea is to create something that's ""not dissimilar from an HR guidebook or handbook. The purpose of rules is to show what good acting is."" It will aim to detail what behavior is appropriate and what isn't, serving as a potential guide for legal action.

It's just one of many calls for change in the industry.

""We need to spend more time talking about how we can amplify the people who have been on the receiving end of horrible misconduct,"" said Ed Zimmerman, cofounder of VentureCrush and a lawyer who chairs the tech group at Lowenstein Sandler LLP. ""How do we diversify the community and make sure people are treated well and are not deprived of opportunity? It is broader than just, 'Can you keep your freaking hands to yourself?'""

Russia denies allegations from governments and intelligence services that it is behind a growing number of cyber attacks on commercial and political targets around the world, including the hackings of recent U.S. and French presidential election campaigns. Asked if the Russian authorities were a threat to the democratic process, Robert Hannigan, who stepped down as head of the UK's intelligence service in March, said: ""Yes ... There is a disproportionate amount of mayhem in cyberspace coming from Russia from state activity."" In his first interview since leaving GCHQ, Hannigan told BBC radio that it was positive that French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel had publicly ""called this out recently"". Standing alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin in May, Macron said state-funded Russian news outlets had sought to destabilize his campaign while the head of Germany's domestic intelligence agency said last week it was expecting Russia to try to influence the German election in September. ""Ultimately people will have to push back against Russian state activity and show that it's unacceptable,"" he said. ""It doesn't have to be by cyber retaliation, but it may be that is necessary at some time in the future. It may be  sanctions and other measures, just to put down some red lines and say that this behavior is unacceptable."" Hannigan also said it would be a mistake  to force social media companies to allow intelligence agencies to access services protected by encryption through so-called ""back door"" access. ""The best you can do with end-to-end encryption is work with companies in a cooperative way to find ways around it frankly,"" he said. He said such ""back doors"" would weaken systems. Hannigan also said governments should wait to see how a global working group on tackling online extremism established by Facebook (FB.O), Google's YouTube (GOOGL.O), Twitter (TWTR.N) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) performed before seeking new laws. ""Legislation is a blunt last resort because frankly extremism is very difficult to define in law and you could spend all your time in court arguing about whether a particular video crosses the line or not,"" he said. Last month, Germany approved a plan to fine social media networks up to 50 million euros ($57 million) if they failed to remove hateful postings promptly. Britain has also mooted bringing in possible sanctions for tech firms that failed to remove extremist content. Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky"
http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/10/us/avalanche-of-hate-daily-stormer-lawsuit/index.html,HOW A MONTANA MOM BECAME THE TARGET OF A NEO-NAZI TROLL STORM,"This story addresses hate speech and contains offensive language that may be disturbing to readers.

Whitefish, Montana (CNN) Once the calls began, they did not stop. Swiping to decline a call just led to the phone ringing again. Blocked number after blocked number filled up the voice mail.

Deleting one message just created space for another to take its place.

Then came the tweets and the email messages.

The volume was overwhelming. The content: vile and terrifying.

Gunshots rang out from voice mails. Emails and texts read: ""I hope you die,"" ""Kill yourself,"" ""We will take pleasure in your pain.""

Tanya Gersh found herself buried in an avalanche of hate, one she had not seen coming and one that focused on one fact: She's Jewish.

Gersh was called a ""bitch,"" ""a worthless c**t,"" and told countless times she was nothing more than a filthy ""k**e."" The vile and ugly words were spelled out in full when sent to Gersh.

The messages began late at night and continued into the early hours, keeping her family awake. Or there was a night of silence, broken by an onslaught at 4 a.m., jolting the family from sleep.

One voice mail -- ""You are surprisingly easy to find on the Internet. And in real life"" -- ended Gersh's lifelong practice of leaving her home and car unlocked in her little Montana town, nestled by a lake in the Rocky Mountains.

It became unbearable, Gersh said. She described panic attacks, vomiting, shaking and sweating. And then the times she could not even catch her breath.

Now, she was in fear of almost anyone she met. Her old way of life had been washed away. She was now in an America full of hate. It was an America where racism and bigotry have powerful online platforms.

Gersh learned that one blog post could lead to an anonymous online assault by a group of hateful people hell bent on destroying her life. All it took was a few keystrokes, amplified by a social media megaphone, to send the deluge of repulsive messages her way and heighten tensions in this quaint ski resort town.

All because of what started, Gersh says, as a ""mother-to-mother"" chat.

Gersh appears to have become a target for hate after contacting tenants of a local building. Gersh says she was then called by the building's owner, Sherry Spencer, the mother of white supremacist Richard Spencer.

This mixed-use property was at the center of a dispute between Sherry Spencer and Tanya Gersh.

Gersh says she warned Sherry Spencer about looming protests at the building in Whitefish, a Montana town of 7,300 where both women live.

Gersh says she advised Spencer to disavow the views of her son, including that the United States is a country for white people. She says she offered to sell Spencer's property as of a way of defusing tensions in town. Gersh suggested Spencer donate money to a human rights group.

Sherry Spencer refused to speak to CNN when we reached her on the phone. Earlier, she wrote in a blog post that Gersh, a Realtor, had threatened her, saying protesters and media would turn up and drive down the building's value if she didn't sell.

Whitefish Police Chief Bill Dial said Sherry Spencer did not file a complaint with police, though her son Richard Spencer accused Gersh of extortion in interviews and a video diary. No law enforcement agency has filed any charges relating to the dispute.

Are y'all ready for an old-fashioned Troll Storm? Andrew Anglin, founder of DailyStormer.com

There was comment aplenty, though, on DailyStormer.com, which spews neo-Nazi propaganda.

Andrew Anglin, the site's founder, accused Gersh of extortion in a blog post. And he exhorted readers to send Gersh -- whom he also identified as Jewish -- enough messages to make a point.

""Let's hit 'em up,"" he posted. ""Are y'all ready for an old-fashioned Troll Storm?""

He then told them: ""(I)t's that time.""

'These are not trolls. They are terrorists'

Tanya Gersh says harassing messages reached her in every corner of her life.

For three months, packed luggage sat on the floor of Gersh's home.

She debated fleeing, to escape what felt like an army of online hate coming after her.

""We were scared that they were going to show up,"" Gersh says. ""It got worse and worse and worse and worse. They just kept perpetuating it.""

Anyone who read Daily Stormer had access to all Gersh's information after Anglin posted it time and again. He put up photos and personal details: phone number, address, workplace and social media profiles -- including one used by her 12-year-old son. Each contained instructions to tell Gersh how they felt.

""Listen here you fucking Jew. You had better back off and leave Richard Spencer's mom alone, you dirty scumbag,"" one caller said on Gersh's voice mail. ""You fucking Jew. You had better back off of Richard Spencer's mom. Everybody is watching you.""

The Daily Stormer published more about Gersh and her ""Jew agenda,"" once with a doctored photo showing her and her tween son on the gates of the Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz.

A tweet was sent to Gersh showing her surrounded by gas, with the message: ""Hickory dickory dock, the kike ran up the clock. The clock struck three and Internet Nazis trolls gassed the rest of them.""

More messages referenced crematoriums and said she should have died in the Holocaust.

A tweet to her 12-year-old son had an image of an oven with the message: ""PSsst kid there is a free X-box inside this oven.""

Gersh thinks she will always be haunted by those images, and by the family talks she was forced to have. They had known the horrors of the Holocaust, but to them it had been something foreign and distant. No longer.

I'm going to make sure it doesn't happen to anybody else. Tanya Gersh, Whitefish resident

She hangs her head, remembering the conversation.

""I never imagined that I would have to teach my children that they might be hated because they are Jewish,"" she says.

For Gersh, these threats were personal and real, not to be confused with generic if vile ramblings on an online comments board.

""These are not trolls. They are terrorists,"" Gersh says. ""They are very harmful, they are very malicious and they are dangerous.""

And Gersh decided to take a stand. She didn't know who had threatened her -- they hid behind withheld numbers and untraceable email addresses -- but knew who she believed had sent them into her life.

""Andrew Anglin has done this to so many people. I'm going to make sure it doesn't happen to anybody else,"" Gersh says defiantly.

Encouraged by the Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama-based organization that monitors hate crimes across the country, she decided to sue Anglin, accusing him of intentional infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy and violation of Montana's anti-intimidation statue.

Protected speech ... or hate?

Andrew Anglin is the founder of The Daily Stormer website.

On DailyStormer.com Anglin wrote he has hired a First Amendment lawyer to fight the lawsuit; he says he was simply ""blogging."" A prominent fundraising post declares: ""The Daily Stormer is being sued by Jewish terrorists. In order to survive, we need shekels."" It is paired with another doctored photo of Tanya Gersh, her head on a dragon's body being slain by a knight on a white horse with the face of Anglin. So far there have been around 2,000 donations, totaling in excess of $150,000.

Still, Anglin did ask readers to leave the Gersh family alone, allow the case to proceed and be simply about protected speech.

""(T)hough this is going to get a lot of publicity, I am asking all of you, genuinely, that you don't attempt to contact the Gershes during this process,"" Anglin wrote on the site. ""This has escalated from jokes on the Internet to something which could potentially lead to a big step towards the hellish, Orwellian world that the enemies of freedom wish to bring down on this country.""

Anglin's has raised $150,000 online after he asked for supporters to donate alongside an image of himself on a horse with a spear through Gersh.

Lawyers for Gersh say it is ironic that they cannot find Anglin -- a man apparently proud of what he's done -- to serve him to compel him to appear in court. But they expect the case to proceed.

""I hope the result is that we get fair compensation for the Gersh family, that we punish Andrew Anglin and the people who are associated with him in this circle of terror,"" SPLC co-counsel John Morrison says. ""And beyond that, my hope is that we wind up convincing him to stop.""

Morrison says they have a strong case.

""This is not free speech, this is nothing protected by the First Amendment, this is not the expression of political opinion,"" he says. ""The purpose of this is to damage these people, the purpose of this is to cause them fear and emotional harm, and that's illegal.""

CNN reached out to Anglin, who told us he now lives in Lagos, Nigeria, where he says his rights to say what he wants are not limited. He declined to comment to us on the Gersh case.

Morrison and Gersh believe Anglin is not the whole problem, as he has followers ready to be encouraged to act. Morrison describes them as an ""army"" that carries out ""vicious attacks that are done in a concerted way at the beck and call of a commander who puts out the orders on this website.""

Robert Ray, who writes features for The Daily Stormer under the name ""Azzmador,"" told CNN he was ""absolutely"" OK with what was written on the site about Gersh. He called her a ""Jewish terrorist"" for allegedly threatening Richard Spencer's mother.

""I want anyone who thinks that they can exert this terroristic activist style political pressure on family members of people whose political views they don't like, I want them all terrified to do that,"" Ray says.

Robert Ray, a Daily Stormer writer, supports Anglin's call to action.

But he adds that messages to Gersh were not threats, but expressions of opinion.

""There's no evidence that anyone from, who was influenced by Daily Stormer, made any death threats or anything,"" he says.

Gersh says she does not expect to change the beliefs of Anglin or his followers. But she does have a message for them.

""You are allowed to believe whatever you want to believe but you absolutely cannot take your beliefs and use it to terrorize,"" Gersh says.

Words do matter, she and her legal team argue. The SPLC tracks instances of hatred from all groups. It says the unapologetic hatred on the Daily Stormer -- which also takes aim at African-Americans and opponents of President Donald Trump, for example -- is a catalyst for division. Among its readers were Charleston, South Carolina, church mass killer Dylann Roof and the murderer of Jo Cox, a British legislator.

For Gersh, this is a new reality. She had never never heard jokes about Jews or been subject to anything anti-Semitic before this. Now she is consumed by fighting a battle she had thought was over. She talks about the Nazis -- with their swastikas, concentration camps and genocide -- being defeated decades ago. And how the world stood up then to say ""Never again.""

But now she finds it is her turn to stand up to another group of people who are adamant in their hatred of Jews. She says she must take on the people who told her she should have died long ago and those who told her they hope she kills herself now.

So Gersh hopes her voice is clear when she echoes those words of warning again to those who have threatened her.

""What we are saying is never again.""

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-mosul-idUSKBN19V105,IRAQI PM DECLARES VICTORY OVER ISLAMIC STATE IN MOSUL,"MOSUL/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraq's prime minister declared victory over Islamic State in Mosul on Monday, three years after the militants seized the city and made it the stronghold of a ""caliphate"" they said would take over the world. ""I announce from here the end and the failure and the collapse of the terrorist state of falsehood and terrorism which the terrorist Daesh announced from Mosul,"" Haider al-Abadi said in a speech shown on state television, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. A 100,000-strong alliance of Iraqi government units, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Shi'ite militias launched the offensive to recapture the northern city from the militants in October, with key air and ground support from a U.S.-led coalition. Abadi, wearing a black military uniform and flanked by commanders from the security forces, thanked troops and the coalition. But he warned that more challenges lay ahead. ""We have another mission ahead of us, to create stability, to build and clear Daesh cells, and that requires an intelligence and security effort, and the unity which enabled us to fight Daesh,"" he said before raising an Iraqi flag. Iraq declared a week-long holiday to mark the victory. People celebrated in the streets of the capital Baghdad and southern cities. Abadi arrived in Mosul on Sunday to congratulate military commanders who have waged a nearly nine-month battle to recapture the city, many parts of which were reduced to rubble. Gunfire and explosions could be heard earlier in the day as the last few Islamic State positions were pounded. The coalition said in a statement Iraqi forces were in ""firm control"" of Mosul, but some areas still needed to be cleared of explosive devices and possible Islamic State fighters in hiding. Around the time of Abadi's announcement, Islamic State released a statement claiming to have mounted an attack on Iraqi forces in Mosul. Reuters could not immediately verify the report. Abadi had been meeting military and political officials in Mosul in an atmosphere of celebration that contrasts with the fear that spread after a few hundred Islamic State militants seized the city and the Iraqi army crumbled in July 2014. Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi shocked the Middle East and Western powers three years ago by appearing at the pulpit of Mosul's Grand al-Nuri Mosque to declare the caliphate and himself the leader of the world's Muslims. A reign of terror followed which eventually alienated even many of those Sunni Muslims who had supported the group as allies against Iraq's Shi'ite majority. Opponents of Islamic State were executed and such crimes as smoking a cigarette were punishable by public whipping. Since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, the Shi'ites have been politically dominant in Iraq but the country has been racked by ethnic conflict. (For a  graphic on destruction in Mosul, click tmsnrt.rs/2sV2emM) In the aftermath of victory in Mosul, Abadi's government  faces the task of managing the sectarian tensions there and elsewhere that enabled Islamic State to win support, and the threat of a wave of revenge violence in the city. The coalition warned that victory in Mosul did not mark the end of the group's global threat. ""Now it is time for all Iraqis to unite to ensure ISIS (Islamic State) is defeated across the rest of Iraq and that the conditions that led to the rise of ISIS in Iraq are not allowed to return again,"" Lt. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend said in a statement. U.S. President Donald Trump congratulated Iraq and said Islamic State's days were numbered. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called the victory ""a critical milestone"" in the war against Islamic State. Baghdadi has fled the city and his whereabouts are unknown. Reports have circulated that he is dead but Iraqi and Western officials say they cannot corroborate this.  His death or capture would not be the end of Islamic State, which still controls areas south and west of Mosul and which is now expected to take to the desert or mountains to wage an insurgency. The militants are likely to keep trying to launch attacks on the West and inspiring violence by ""lone wolves"" or small groups of the kind mounted recently in Britain, France and elsewhere. But the loss of Iraq's second-largest city is a grave body blow to Islamic State. Islamic State is also under heavy pressure in its operational headquarters in the Syrian city of Raqqa. But a concern shared by the United States and its coalition allies is that Iran could fill the vacuum left by the Sunni militants to expand in both Iraq and Syria. Qassem Soleimani, head of the Quds Force, the extraterritorial branch of Shi'ite Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said on Monday Iran had sent ""thousands of tonnes"" of arms and fighter jets to Iraq to help it fight Islamic State, Iranian media reported. The stench of corpses along Mosul's streets was a reminder of the gruelling urban warfare required to dislodge Islamic State. Much of the city of 1.5 million has been destroyed in the fighting, its centuries-old stone buildings flattened by air strikes and other explosions. One of Islamic State's last acts was to blow up the historic al-Nuri mosque and its famous leaning minaret. Thousands of people have been killed. The United Nations says 920,000 civilians have fled their homes since the military campaign began in October. Close to 700,000 people are still displaced. ""It's a relief to know that the military campaign in Mosul is ending. The fighting may be over, but the humanitarian crisis is not,"" said U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq Lise Grande.""Many of the people who have fled have lost everything. They need shelter, food, health care, water, sanitation and emergency kits. The levels of trauma we are seeing are some of the highest anywhere. What people have experienced is nearly unimaginable."" Iraqi soldiers relaxed. Some swam in the Tigris river which runs through the city. One wiped the sweat from his face with an Islamic State flag. Writing by Michael Georgy; Editing by Andrew Roche"

The bulk of Waymos case is not over patents, but trade secrets.Waymo alleges that Uber stole trade secrets from Waymo when Anthony Levandowski, who worked for Waymo, downloaded 14,000 files to his personal computer and then joined Uber to lead the startups driverless car program. Uber fired Levandowski in late May. The executive has invoked his constitutional right against self-incrimination and has refused to testify in the case, hindering Ubers ability to defend itself against Waymos claims.U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco has asked Waymo to narrow its more than 100 trade secrets claims to fewer than 10 to put in front of a jury. In a June 7 hearing, he also said, ""I want to reiterate to the plaintiff here that you should think a lot about just dropping the patent part of this case.""Read more about this legal fight""Waymos retreat on three of their four patent claims is yet another sign that they have overpromised and cant deliver,"" Uber said in a statement. ""Not only have they uncovered zero evidence of any of the 14,000 files in question coming to Uber, they now admit that Ubers LiDAR design is actually very different than theirs. Faced with this hard truth, Waymo has resorted to floating conspiracy theories not rooted in fact, doing everything they can to put the focus on sensation rather than substance.""Lidar is a key component that helps autonomous vehicles see their surroundings, and its at the center of this case. A Waymo spokesman said Friday that it dropped the three patent claims because they relate to a specific ""Spider"" lidar design that Uber no longer uses. The fourth patent claim focuses on another lidar design, ""Fuji,"" that the startup continues to use, the spokesman said.""Uber has assured the court in statements made under penalty of perjury that it no longer uses and will not use that device, so we have narrowed the issues for trial by dismissing the patent claims as to that device, with the right to re-file suit if needed,"" the Waymo spokesman said in a statement. ""We look forward to trial.The case is Waymo LLC v. Uber Technologies Inc., 17-cv-00939, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco)."
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-vote-idUSKBN19S2FG,TRUMP'S VOTER FRAUD PANEL TO MEET AS U.S. STATES' REFUSALS MOUNT,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's commission to investigate possible election fraud will convene this month, a government notice said on Friday, as more U.S. states have refused to hand over at least some voter data. Trump created the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in May, after claiming without evidence that millions of people voted illegally for his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in the 2016 election. U.S. civil rights groups and Democratic lawmakers have called the panel a voter suppression tactic by Trump, a Republican who won the presidential election by securing a majority in the Electoral College tally of delegates even as he lost the popular vote to Clinton by some 3 million votes. The Electronic Privacy Information Center, a watchdog group, has filed a lawsuit to block the commission's data request until its privacy impact can be weighed. A hearing in the case was scheduled for Friday afternoon. There is a wide consensus among state officials from both parties and election experts that voter fraud is rare. States rejecting the commission's attempts to gather voter information have called it unnecessary and a violation of privacy. Most U.S. states have rejected full compliance with the commission's requests. Republican Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the commission's vice chairman, said in a statement sent by the White House that 14 states and Washington, D.C., had rejected the request outright.   The commission will meet on July 19 to swear in members, formulate objectives and discuss next steps after asking the 50 states to turn over potentially sensitive voter information, according to a General Services Administration (GSA) notice published in the Federal Register. A June 28 letter from the election panel sought names, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, addresses, birth dates, political affiliations, felony convictions and voting histories. Matthew Dunlap, Maine's Democratic secretary of state and a commission member, on Friday dismissed Trump's claim that millions of voters illegally cast ballots. ""We just don't see that,"" he told CNN. ""People are incredibly law abiding."" Although Maine is one state that has pushed back at the commission's request, Dunlap said he hopes the panel can tackle voting issues including ballot access and hacking. A Republican commission member, former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, defended the panel, telling CNN on Thursday that fraud with even ""one vote per precinct ... can change the course of history."" A court filing in the Electronic Privacy Information Center case also showed the panel plans to house data on White House computers rather than at the GSA. The Washington Post, which earlier reported the filing, noted GSA would be required to follow specific privacy requirements. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow tried to tilt the election in Trump's favor. Moscow has dismissed the accusations. Trump has denied any collusion and has questioned the agencies' conclusion as well as any Russian role. Writing by Susan Heavey; Editing by David Gregorio and Grant McCool"

Follow her on Twitter . The views expressed in this commentary are her own.

(CNN) Something in the world of body shaming and fat hatred is shifting. There is a small but noisy contingent of people who are tired of being quiet. This past week alone, two women refused to sit down when faced with fat shaming.

First, there was Natalie Hage , a plus size Instagram model from Texas. According to Hage, she was traveling on an American Airlines flight from Dallas to Los Angeles, when she was seated next to a man who was disgruntled by her size. Before take off, she claims the man made his disdain for her larger body obvious by shifting, grunting and exchanging cruel and demeaning text messages about her with someone on his phone. Rather than shrink in shame, as caught on video , Hage stood up for herself by confronting the man and pointing out that his actions were hurtful and that his judgments of her size were based on fat bias not facts.

A few days later, on the Fourth of July, Grammy award winning singer Kelly Clarkson tweeted a thank you to all those who have served to protect our independence and freedom. While this should have been a kind but fairly innocuous tweet, Clarkson's body size drew the ire of a fat shaming Twitter troll, who responded by telling Clarkson she was fat. Clarkson's response was simple, ""... and still f---ing awesome.""

Both Hage and Clarkson have embraced a rising cultural voice that is a byproduct of the fat activist and body positive movements -- the empowered fat voice. A group of informed fat people are starting to realize that the shame and stigma directed toward them isn't justified, and they don't need to remain silent in the face of disrespect.

These two instances aren't anomalies. In just the last few months I have seen other examples of fat people refusing to let fat bias in the culture stand. Consider the marketing for ""Red Shoes and the Seven Dwarfs,"" a forthcoming film starring actress ChloÃÂ© Moretz. The film is a fairy tale, a retelling of Snow White that features a pair of magical red shoes. When Snow White wears the shoes she is attractive but when she removes them she is her true and ugly self. In the billboard and the trailer for the film, the shoes are removed and the major change in Snow White's appearance is that she becomes fat.

The tag line next to fat Snow White on the billboard reads, ""What if Snow White was no longer beautiful...?,"" and in the trailer two dwarfs hiding in Snow White's bedroom are appalled when she removes the shoes to reveal her fatness. The marketing team was mistaken in creating giant billboards and a trailer, which implied that a fat version of Snow White couldn't be understood as beautiful.

Because beauty matters in our culture, directing this message at children -- that fat can't be beautiful -- encourages an understanding of fat people as less valuable than thin people and unworthy of our respect. This is not only a terrible lesson that can affect individual struggles with self esteem but also allows for justification of bias behaviors, such as bullying.

Like with Clarkson and Hage, this fat-shaming incident did not go unrecognized. Instead, the empowered fat voice rose again. This time in the form of plus size supermodel, Tess Holliday, who took to Twitter to call out the film's marketing as fat shaming.

Holliday's tweet alerted Moretz, who immediately recognized the issue and distanced herself from the project, noting that she did not approve of the marketing campaign. In response, in late May, the campaign was pulled and the producers of the film issued an apology

In this case, the sound of the empowered fat voice alerted onlookers to fat injustice anwd there was resulting action taken: the marketing campaign was pulled or, if you will, the offensive and bias representation was discontinued and therefore harmed far fewer people than it could have. That's powerful stuff, right?

Please don't misconstrue my point -- the culture appears to remain as hateful toward fat bodies as ever. Fat people still have to endure systemic prejudice -- bias from doctors, employers and educators , as well as hurtful daily interactions, snickers and demeaning comments. The media still relies on degrading fat stereotypes.

It's a mistake by Trump that puts America and Russia on the same moral plane, he writes

Edward Lucas is a senior editor at The Economist, at which he was the Moscow bureau chief from 1998 to 2002. He also is senior vice president at the Center for European Policy Analysis, a Washington think tank. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) The first day of the G20 summit in Hamburg was notable for the attention given to Donald Trump's first face-to-face meeting with Vladimir Putin and the ferocity of the day's protests.

It would be nice to think that the protesters were particularly irked by the sight of two autocratic, media-hating leaders with dodgy business connections getting together. Sadly, the Trump-Putin meeting is a sideshow as far as the anti-globalization movement is concerned. They object to the whole idea of the G20, seeing the summit as the epitome of a global system based on a rapacious economic model and run by unaccountable elites.

Edward Lucas

While they are catching their breath from attacking the police and burning things down, the protesters might like to think how much worse they would fare if the summit were in Moscow or Beijing. Western democracies have many faults, but they do allow peaceful protest. Russia -- and China -- treat dissent much more harshly.

The protesters are greatly fired up by imperialism. Yet the biggest imperialists at the G20 are not the Western countries but the Russian and Chinese leaders. Xi Jinping's Communist Party occupies Tibet (and East Turkestan and Inner Mongolia). Mr. Putin's Kremlin has savagely crushed the Chechens, and pursues a chauvinist Russians-first policy in republics of the Russian Federation such as Tatarstan, Bashkiria, Mari-El and Komi. I doubt the protesters have ever heard of these places.

It is also odd that protesters hate President Trump, as he shares their disdain for the global trading system. Admittedly, they disagree about the nature of that unfairness -- Trump dislikes the rules-based international order because he thinks it is unfair to America, the biggest and richest country in the world, while the protesters object to the way the system is tilted against poor countries. But that is a secondary point.

It was the second time Sessions has visited Guantanamo Bay

Washington (CNN) While President Donald Trump has been abroad at the G20 Summit, Attorney General Jeff Sessions took a trip of his own -- a visit to the Guantanamo Bay prison camp at the US naval base on Cuba.

Sessions traveled to Guantanamo with his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats.

The Friday day trip was the first visit Sessions has taken to the detention facility since becoming attorney general. His last visit was in 2005 under then-President George W. Bush's administration.

Department of Justice spokesman Ian Prior said the purpose of the travel was ""to have an up-to-date understanding of current operations ... to gain that understanding by meeting with the people on the ground who are leading our government-wide efforts at GTMO,"" an acronym the military uses to describe the military base in Cuba.

""Keeping this country safe from terrorists is the highest priority of the Trump administration,"" Prior said in the statement. ""Recent attacks in Europe and elsewhere confirm that the threat to our nation is immediate and real, and it remains essential that we use every lawful tool available to prevent as many attacks as possible.""

http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/09/technology/amazon-prime-day-2017/index.html?section=money_topstories,AMAZON PRIME DAY: GET READY FOR 30 HOURS OF DEALS,"Amazon's annual day of deals kicks off at 9 p.m. ET on Monday.

It's the third installment of Prime Day, and the event has already proven to net massive sales.

This year the company has promised it will be bigger than ever, with discounts on hundreds of thousands of items for Prime members all over the globe.

Amazon has given a few hints about what's to come. If past years are any indicator, the deals will encompass a wide, if not comical, variety of items.

Here's what you need to know.

30 hours to shop

Prime Day will actually run a bit longer than 24 hours.

It kicks off at 9 p.m. ET on July 10 and runs until 3 a.m. ET on July 12. Amazon says new deals will be offered every five minutes.

Greg Greeley, vice president of Amazon Prime, says the goal is to offer deals to ""a record number of shoppers.""

Amazon says customers who do not already have Prime memberships can sign up on or before July 11 to take advantage of this year's deals. Prime costs about $100 per year.

Track deals ahead of time

Amazon advises shoppers to use the Amazon app, where deals will be posted 24 hours ahead of time. You can even set an alert for when the offer begins.

Get exclusive and early deals with Alexa

Customers shopping with a gadget equipped with Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant will get access to Prime Day deals two hours before anyone else.

Voice shoppers also have access to ""more than 100"" exclusive pre-Prime Day offers. Those deals began July 5, Amazon says.

Some deals that are already available include $50 off on a Bose Soundlink Bluetooth speaker, and $20 off a Philips light strip that works with Alexa.

One more perk of voice shopping: If you don't yet have a Prime Day membership, you can now sign up through Alexa and receive a $20 discount, putting the one-year membership price at $79.

Televisions on sale

We don't yet know much about what the Prime Day offers will be. But the company did say there will be some ""amazing"" deals on a ""variety"" of television brands -- including the Amazon Fire TV edition of the ultra high-definition Element 4K TV.

""Amazon is planning one of its largest total volume TV deals in history with a record level of inventory but once again, the TV deals will likely sell out,"" the company said in a press release.

Items selling out lightning-fast plagued Prime Day's inaugural event back in 2015. Last year, Amazon beefed up inventory. But Prime Day 2016 was beleaguered by some technical difficulties when some customers found it difficult to add certain deals to their shopping carts.

Prime Now sales

There will also be deals on Amazon's Prime Now platform, which offers same-day delivery in some cities. Prime Now shoppers get same-day delivery and a different selection of items, including perishable foods.

Some of the Prime Now bargains kicked off on Friday, and Amazon says it's currently offering 25% off of Haagen-Dazs and Halo Top ice creams, 30% off some beauty products and 30% off wine and beer in a limited number of cities.

Amazon is also offering $10 off the first and second order for any first-time Prime Now customers with the code ""10PRIMEDAY.""

More customers abroad will have access

In addition to the U.S., shoppers in 12 other countries -- including the U.K., Mexico and China -- can participate this year.

The deals will differ in each country, but Amazon says there will be a new Amazon Global Store in which Prime members in China and Mexico will be able to shop select deals in other countries."
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-10/bill-koch-s-spending-scrutinized-in-clash-over-oxbow-carbon-sale,BILL KOCH'S SPENDING SCRUTINIZED IN CLASH OVER OXBOW SALE,"For the last two years, private-equity firm Crestview Partners LP has been trying to detach itself from Oxbow Carbon LLC, a company founded by billionaire William Koch. The corporate divorce has turned ugly, with recently unsealed emails suggesting that Koch mismanaged the company and used it as his personal ATM.Delaware Chancery Judge Travis Laster began hearing testimony Monday in an acrimonious lawsuit in Wilmington. Koch maintains that Crestview officials are waging a smear campaign to oust him as chief executive in order to ram through a sale of Oxbow, according to court papers.The unsealed emails show that some Oxbow directors expressed concerns about Koch, the companys chief executive, using company funds to pay for his Dassault Falcon jet and his childrens education at a private school Koch founded in West Palm Beach, Florida.Cant believe he billed the company for his kids tuition, Barry Volpert, one of Crestviews co-founders and an Oxbow board member, wrote in a September 2015 email to Eric Johnson, then Oxbows chief commercial officer.Yes it is ridiculous, Johnson replied, according to court records. He has used Oxbow as his personal ATM for years.Johnson, whom Koch fired in 2016, was one of many talented executives ousted by the billionaire founder, Robert Hurst, a Crestview partner who serves on the Oxbows board, testified Monday. Johnson was tapped earlier this month as CEO and president of Gulf Oil.Hurst said Kochs intimidating management style created a climate of fear within Oxbows executive ranks that has made it difficult for the company to attract talent. Theres a pattern here of anyone who stands up to Bill takes a bullet, he said.If Kochs allies didnt represent a majority of directors on Oxbows board, the billionaire would have been relieved of his responsibilities years ago, Hurst added.Crestview invested $150 million in Oxbow in 2007, according to testimony in the Delaware case. The investment agreement with Oxbow, one of the worlds biggest producers of petroleum coke used in aluminum production, included a so-called put right to cash out its position after seven years and push for a sale if the request wasnt honored.Crestview moved to divest its Oxbow holdings in September 2015. Koch rejected the request, prompting the investment firm to demand an exit sale, according to court filings. Crestview officials accuse Koch of dragging his feet on a sale to pay off investors.Koch and board member David Rosow discussed obstructing and derailing a sale process before Crestviews request, Michael McAuliffe, Oxbows former general counsel, said in unsealed portions of a May deposition. They were concerned Crestview would push to sell the company at a low price, he said.Moelis & Co., a New York-based investment bank, estimated Oxbows fair-market value at $2.65 billion for purposes of the sale, according a portion of an unsealed May 31 deposition of James Freney, a company executive.Kochs lawyers said Crestview had already received $350 million from Oxbow in distributions on its investment, and they argued the private equity fund was pushing to sell the company in a down market.You are forcing the sale of the company at the worst possible time, arent you? Michael Gardener, a lawyer for company asked Hurst during cross-examination on Monday. The Crestview partner said the sale procedure called for investors to get fair-market value as part of the transaction.Koch, who is expected to testify in the case later this week, is the brother of conservative billionaire political donors David Koch and Charles Koch. He is worth an estimated $3.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Brad Goldstein, a spokesman for Koch and Oxbow, blamed a downturn in the commodities market and procedural issues stemming from the investment agreement for any sale delays. The downturn has hurt Oxbows value, raising questions about the viability of a quick sale, he said, and added that Judge Laster had warned that one minority investor shouldnt be able to dictate to all the other investors.Mr. Rosow and the other Oxbow board members have a fiduciary obligation to every shareholder to make certain that the terms of the LLC agreement are followed, Goldstein said.Jeffrey Taufield, a Crestview spokesman, declined to comment on the unsealed emails or the trial over the funds sale demand.The emails show questions about Kochs spending have been raised multiple times since 2015. That year, Oxbow directors probed the billionaires use of company funds for his jet including maintenance and hangar rental. An internal board probe found the company was subsidizing his personal use of the plane, Hurst testified Monday.Koch agreed in 2015 to reimburse Oxbow $5.3 million for jet charges, and agreed to take over the planes costs, court records show. The billionaires decision to reimburse the company was not an acknowledgment that those charges were inappropriate, Goldstein said. He agreed to do that to take issues about the plane off the table as he dealt with Crestviews demand for a sale.Its unclear if the company paid tuition for Kochs children at Oxbridge Academy, a private high school. Koch founded the school in 2011 to give his children a better educational experience than he had growing up.In court papers, Koch said he wasnt reimbursed for any Oxbridge tuition. Goldstein said the billionaire paid full freight for four of his children to attend the school, and none of them are presently enrolled there.Still, in March, Laster ordered him to hand over files about payments he or the company made to the school. Crestview officials accuse Koch of attempting to delay a sale in order to continue the companys support for the school.The case is In Re Oxbow Carbon LLC Unitholder Litigation, CA12447, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington)."
http://cnn.com/2017/07/10/opinions/advocating-cte-option-opinion-taylor/index.html,"FORGET BLUE COLLAR, IT'S ABOUT 'NEW COLLAR'","Story highlights Peter Taylor: To better prepare our future workforce, we need to encourage more career and technical education programs

The prevailing narrative that the only higher education credential that matters is a four-year degree is false, writes Taylor

Peter J. Taylor is president and chief executive officer of Zenith Education Group, a nonprofit vocational education organization that offers programs in the allied health, automotive and construction trades. Zenith was launched in February 2015 when its parent company, ECMC Group, took over a subset of schools from the now-defunct Corinthian Colleges chain, transitioning them to nonprofit status. Prior to joining ECMC Group, Taylor was chief financial officer of the University of California system. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.



(CNN) While overall business optimism remains high, leaders of companies big and small across the United States are concerned about the skills gap -- the mismatch between the skills the workforce has to offer and the skills employers need. In fact, more than 50% of Business Roundtable's CEO members report that talent gaps are ""already problematic or very problematic"" for their companies and industries.

Yet when it comes to preparing our future workforce to meet businesses' needs, there's a prevailing attitude in America that the only higher education credential that matters is a four-year degree. This stigma against alternative education pathways hurts potential students and the nation as a whole.

Peter Taylor

To change the narrative, we need a collective effort that makes the case for career and technical education (CTE) as a valuable pathway to both significant professional opportunities in today's job market and a critical means to help close our country's skills gap. In making this case, we would be able to overcome a significant roadblock to lower unemployment rates and advance economic growth and global competitiveness. Students who choose the CTE approach also deserve our support and encouragement.

The solution, laid out by a growing number of Fortune 500 business leaders, isn't ensuring that more students receive degrees from four-year institutions. As IBM CEO Ginni Rometty argued at a recent Business Roundtable panel, moving past the paradigm of the four-year degree will change the future of the United States for the better. Rometty has also been a strong proponent of "" new collar "" jobs that require vocational training but not a four-year degree -- for example, automotive technicians, pharmacy technicians, dental and medical assistants and even jobs in innovative fields like computing, such as cloud computing technicians and service delivery specialists.

Statements like these are helpful in dispelling the stigma against career training and positioning this higher education track as a solution to fill the gap that is causing such angst for business leaders today.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/09/middleeast/syria-ceasefire-begins/index.html,CEASEFIRE BROKERED BY US AND RUSSIA BEGINS IN SYRIA,"(CNN) A ceasefire brokered by the US, Russia and Jordan went into effect Sunday in southwest Syria as part of an agreement hailed as a precursor to greater cooperation between Russia and the US over the war-ravaged country.

The plan was announced Friday at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, after a meeting between US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.

The leaders also agreed to establish three de-escalation zones in Syria. Russian military police, coordinating with the US and Jordan, will initially ensure security around the de-escalation zone, officials said.

The ceasefire affects the regions of Deraa and Suweida, along the Jordanian border, as well as Quneitra, near borders with Lebanon and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights . The areas in southern Syria will be the first in which the US is party to a de-escalation zone.

White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said in a statement Saturday that such de-escalation zones are a US priority.

""The United States remains committed to defeating ISIS, helping to end the conflict in Syria, reducing suffering, and enabling people to return to their homes,"" he said. ""This agreement is an important step toward these common goals.""

The new brokered agreement is the fifth attempt at a ceasefire in a country that has been embroiled in conflict since 2011. Three of those ceasefires unraveled within months. The fourth attempt this May was never enforced when rebel groups denounced the deal shortly after its signing.

Greater US-Russia cooperation?

The US and Russia ""promised to ensure that all groups there comply with the ceasefire"" and ""provide humanitarian access,"" Lavrov said.

A State Department official said Friday that they're still working on how to monitor and enforce the ceasefire.

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who sat in on the discussion between the two leaders, told reporters Friday that the agreement signaled further cooperation in Syria.

The US and Russian governments have diverging long-term goals in Syria. Russia has spent the last two years supporting the Assad regime with airstrikes and special forces on the ground. In that time, the regime has gradually reasserted control over major cities, with rebel groups being finally driven out of Aleppo, the largest city in Syria, at the beginning of this year.

The US has focused on defeating ISIS by nurturing the Syrian Democratic Forces, an alliance of Arab tribes and Kurds, in the north and east of the country. Gradually, they have pushed ISIS out of large swathes of territory, aided by hundreds of coalition airstrikes, and are now inside Raqqa -- the self-proclaimed ISIS capital.

""This is our first indication of the US and Russia being able to work together in Syria,"" Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said.

News of a ceasefire agreement comes as US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are pushing into Raqqa.

Earlier, Tillerson said the US was prepared to work with Russia to establish no-fly zones in Syria in an effort to bring stability to the country.

A warning from Netanyahu

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave his guarded support to the ceasefire agreement, raising the specter of an empowered Hezbollah should the de-escalation zones allow the Syrian regime to capture more territory.

JUST WATCHED Syria: What Israel sees Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Syria: What Israel sees 02:41

The newly established de-escalation zones lie only a few kilometers from Israel's northeastern borders.

""Israel will welcome a genuine ceasefire in Syria, but this ceasefire must not enable the establishment of a military presence by Iran and its proxies in Syria in general and in southern Syria in particular,"" Netanyahu said ahead of his weekly Cabinet meeting on Sunday.

""I had deep discussions about this last week with US Secretary of State Tillerson and with Russian Vladimir Putin. Both told me that they understand Israel's position and will take our demands into account.""

Netanyahu said fears that the threat posed by Iran-backed Hezbollah to Israel could intensify as Syrian regime forces continue to recapture territory.

""For our part, we will continue to monitor developments beyond our borders while strongly upholding our red lines: prevent the strengthening of Hezbollah via Syria, with emphasis on the acquisition of precision weapons; prevent Hezbollah -- or Iranian forces -- from establishing a ground presence along our border; and prevent the establishment of an Iranian military presence in Syria as a whole,"" he said."

Ã¢ÂÂI can't comprehend how far out this is going to go, but it's big and I'm excited to be a part of something that's bigger than just me and our local Asheville community,Ã¢ÂÂ said Davison.

The court has helped veterans who land in the system because of opioid or alcohol abuse by pairing them with mentors, counselors and employers. It is currently assisting 19 veterans. One has already graduated.

Ã¢ÂÂA majority of our clients suffer from opioid addiction and some have military sexual trauma we have to work with them on. Alcohol is another big one,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Eric Howard. Ã¢ÂÂWe really work with them on a regimented treatment plan.Ã¢ÂÂ

Veterans who complete the program have the opportunity for non-violent crimes to be expunged from their records.

Resident Superior Court Judge Marvin Pope Jr. said he was inspired after seeing the conditions of veterans returning from places like Iraq.

Ã¢ÂÂOur veterans are so severely injured when they return from these wars. They're treated with these medications, and they are just left to fend for themselves to deal with society,Ã¢ÂÂ said Pope. Ã¢ÂÂWhen they go back in, they find themselves abusing drugs and self-medicating.Ã¢ÂÂ

He said the likelihood of convicted criminals who committed a felony to return to jail is 60 percent. That number goes down to 30 percent for convicts in drug treatment court. It decreases even more for veterans in treatment court, at just 3 percent.

Ã¢ÂÂIt uses military training and applies that to help him resolve the problems and treat what has caused this problem,Ã¢ÂÂ said Pope.

Organizers hope to become a model for the country and get more grant money from lawmakers at the conference this weekend.

Ã¢ÂÂWe have a lot of support, but it takes a lot of work to build those networks and make sure we work within the community,Ã¢ÂÂ said Howard. Ã¢ÂÂNothing happens without community partnership.Ã¢ÂÂ"

The meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan on June 9, 2016, was the first confirmed private meeting between members of the president's inner circle and a Russian national, the newspaper reported, citing confidential government records and interviews with people familiar with the documents. Donald Trump Jr. confirmed the get-together in a statement, describing it as ""a short introductory meeting"" that focused mainly on the issue of child adoption. He said he also asked Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign manager Paul Manafort to take part in the meeting. A lawyer for Kushner said Trump's son-in-law ""briefly attended"" the meeting. A federal special counsel and several congressional committees are investigating possible contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian representatives, as part of a larger probe into allegations that Moscow meddled in the 2016 presidential election. The Times article appeared a day after Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the allegations of election meddling during the summit of leaders from the Group of 20 major economies in Hamburg, Germany.  Donald Trump Jr. said the meeting was held primarily to  discuss a popular program to help Americans adopt Russian children, which the Russian government had ended. ""But it was not a campaign issue at that time and there was no follow up,"" he said in the statement. ""I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand."" Kushner attorney Jamie Gorelick said Trump's son-in-law ""briefly attended"" the meeting, adding that Kushner had over 100 calls or meetings with representatives from more than 20 countries during the campaign and post-election transition.   ""As Mr. Kushner has consistently stated, he is eager to cooperate and share what he knows,"" Gorelick said in a statement. A spokesman for Manafort did not respond to a Reuters query.  The Times said the Russian lawyer at the meeting, Natalia Veselnitskaya, is known for campaigning against a U.S. law that blacklists suspected Russian human rights abusers. The law enraged Putin, who retaliated by halting American adoptions of Russian children, the newspaper reported.  The Times said the adoption issue is a frequently used talking point for opponents of the U.S. law. Editing by Alistair Bell"
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-07/another-bullion-flash-crash-is-testing-the-nerve-of-traders,Missing,"After-hours surges and plunges that have whipsawed gold and silver prices over the past two weeks are unnerving traders.Silver futures sank as much as 10 percent, as more than 25 million ounces of the precious metal traded within a minute just after 7 a.m. in Singapore Friday. Last week, gold fell below its 200-day moving average after 1.8 million ounces were transacted in a minute at 4 a.m. in New York. A day later, gold spiked after a similar trade involving more than 800,000 ounces.Such moves, which occurred at times when liquidity in these markets is generally lowest, are giving traders an additional headache at a time when investor sentiment is already turning bearish. Hedge funds are retreating, while exchange-traded fund investors are pulling out of gold, pushing the precious metal to the lowest in almost four months.All fundamental factors aside, it does tremendous technical damage to the market, Bill ONeill, a partner at Logic Advisors in Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, said by telephone. There should be some effort to study this and come to some solution that will make for a more orderly trading pattern. This type of activity is not good for a fair playing field.Gold has lost about $47 since the session before that 1.8 million ounce-trade that many blamed on a fat-finger, or erroneous trade. While ONeill believes that trade may have been done in error, he said the precious metal struggled to bounce back from its low on June 26 because the transaction pushed the price below the 200-day moving average, triggering automated sell orders set by algorithmic traders, thereby sustaining the slump.In the case of Fridays silver plunge, the unusual increase in volatility triggered the so-called velocity logic, a safeguard set in place by CME Group, pausing the market for 10 seconds, spokesman Chris Grams said in an email.Our markets worked as designed, Grams said. The pause allowed liquidity to come back into the market. Per our rule book, prices were adjusted in the September and December silver futures contracts and several mini futures contracts.Silver futures for September delivery pared their losses to settle 3.5 percent lower at $15.425 an ounce at 1:36 p.m. in New York, after tumbling to as low as $14.34 before the CME safeguard was triggered.In the case of gold, the CME said no such temporary halt were ordered for gold on June 26, when prices fell as much as 1.6 percent, or $19.90 an ounce.The last time velocity logic was triggered for gold was in January 2014 at 10:14 a.m. in New York, after the metal fell more than $30 an ounce in about a minute. Prices fell as much as 2.1 percent that day, in trading of more than 8,000 contracts.The volume surge may have already raised red flags for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates the precious metals futures market, according to Bob Haberkorn, a senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago.Regulators look at anything that has sudden, sharp and long moves, George Gero, a managing director at RBC Wealth Management in New York, said. Thats their normal job.CFTC Public Affairs Deputy Director Donna Faulk-White said the commission doesnt comment on, or even acknowledge the existence of, any possible investigations.These so-called flash crashes that occur periodically are frustrating to traders caught on the wrong side of the downdraft, Jim Wyckoff, senior analyst at Kitco Metals Inc., a research company in Montreal, said in report. It also makes many market watchers question the viability of futures markets, which are supposed to create more liquidity and better price discovery."
http://cnn.com/2017/07/07/health/resistant-gonorrhea-antibiotics/index.html,THIS STD IS BECOMING 'SMARTER' AND HARDER TO TREAT,"(CNN) Gonorrhea is becoming harder and in some cases impossible to treat with antibiotics, the World Health Organization said.

""The bacteria that cause gonorrhea are particularly smart. Every time we use a new class of antibiotics to treat the infection, the bacteria evolve to resist them,"" said Teodora Wi, a human reproduction specialist at the WHO, in a news release.

Three superbugs -- bacteria that cannot be killed by the best available drug -- were detected in Japan, France and Spain, according to the WHO.

""We need to be more vigilant now,"" Wi told reporters in a phone briefing.

Each year, about 78 million people worldwide are infected with gonorrhea , the WHO said. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there are 820,000 new gonorrhea infections each year.

Data from 77 countries collected by WHO shows there is a widespread resistance to older, cheaper antibiotics and in some countries, the infection has became ""untreatable by all known antibiotics,"" the international health organization said in the news release.

Earlier this year, gonorrhea was named among 11 types of bacteria that health experts believe pose the greatest threats to human health because they are in urgent need of new antibiotics.

Marc Sprenger, WHO's director of antimicrobial resistance, said there's an urgent need for drugs and tests to prevent, diagnose and treat gonorrhea.

More specifically, Sprenger said, the health community needs new antibiotics, a long term vaccine to prevent the infection and tests that will predict with accuracy if an antibiotic will work on a particular infection.

Gonorrhea has developed resistance to nearly every class of antibiotics used to treat it such as penicillin, tetracycline and fluoroquinolones, the CDC said.

""It's important to understand that ever since antibiotics appeared on the scene, Neisseria gonorrhoeae has been fairly quick in developing resistance to all the classes of antibiotics that have been thrown at it,"" Manica Balasegaram, director of the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership, told reporters.

From 2009-2014 the WHO says that several countries discovered a widespread resistance to drugs used to treat gonorrhea like ciprofloxacin, azithromycin and even last resort treatments such as extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs), the health organization said.

In 2016, the organization began advising doctors to switch to a two-drug combination: ceftriaxone and azithromycin after more than 50 countries reported that ESCs were no longer effective in some cases.

Why drugs stop working?

The sexually transmitted infection is becoming resistant to the usual recommended treatments around the world and creating new antibiotics is ""not very attractive for commercial pharmaceutical companies,"" the WHO said.

Gonorrhea symptoms include a burning sensation when urinating and unusual discharge from the penis or vagina. Left untreated, the infection can cause serious health problems including long-term abdominal pain and pelvic inflammatory disease, which could lead to ectopic pregnancy and infertility.

But most people who are infected do not have any symptoms and in some cases, doctors mistakenly diagnose gonorrhea, health officials said.

Using antibiotics improperly is contributing to the development of antibiotic resistance in gonorrhea as well as other bacterial diseases, health officials said.

In the US, the CDC recommends a two-drug regimen -- ceftriaxone and azithromycin -- for treating gonorrhea.

Last year, a cluster of infections in Hawaii did not succumb as easily to the antibiotics as infections have in the past.

""Since 2005, we have seen four isolated cases that showed resistance to both drugs. But the Hawaii cases are the first cluster we have seen with reduced susceptibility to both drugs,"" said Paul Fulton Jr., a spokesman for the CDC."
