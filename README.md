# Basic NLP

A first attempt at a simple natural language processor.

My code includes the following functionality:
* Identify tokens in a sentence.
* Retrieve synonyms for a list of words from wordnet.
* Stem a list of words.
* Add token column to a data structure read in from a CSV file.
* Add keyword column (stemmed tokens + stemmed synonyms) to data structure.
